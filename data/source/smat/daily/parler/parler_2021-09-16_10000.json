I'm not rushin' you because that's make me a Russian HAHHAHAHHAHAH!\" such a goober joke but still totally you. \n\nYour shithead friend (you know the one who called you a brown shirt nearly every day) yeah he blames you for your death. All you needed was the lethal jab and you'd still be alive. Let's not look at the hospital that didn't help you, all they did was make you comfortable by putting you in a coma, until your mother pulled your plug. There's another 40k to the hospital from the state, they never cared. \n\nYour Unicorn misses you greatly. She's not coping well with your passing, please come down and giver her one last hug, Lord knows she needs it. She's looking for someone to crochet a unicorn poncho for her. ",
