          "bodywithurls": "By Eric M. Johnson -  SEATTLE (Reuters) –     Boeing Co said on Tuesday it handed over 22 airplanes to buyers in August as revived domestic travel fuels 737 MAX deliveries, and received orders for seven 787s even as the program for that jet remains hobbled by industrial defects.\n\nThe closely watched monthly orders and deliveries snapshot comes as Boeing bids to recoup billions of dollars in lost sales from the coronavirus pandemic, and move beyond the safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes.\n\nOf the 22 jetliners handed over to airlines and other buyers last month, 14 were 737 MAX jets and two were P-8 maritime patrol aircraft. The remaining six jets were widebodies, including three KC-46 tankers for the U.S. Air Force.",
