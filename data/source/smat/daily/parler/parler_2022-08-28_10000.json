It’s a political and legal earthquake.\n\nThe government’s collusion with Big Tech to censor Americans is decisively NOT CONSPIRACY THEORY, but FACT.",
          "bodywithurls": "Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, along with Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, filed a lawsuit (Missouri v. Biden) against the Biden Administration, Anthony Fauci, the Department of Homeland Security, and nearly a dozen federal agencies and Secretaries.\n\nThe suit alleges a massive coordinated effort by the Deep State to work with Big Tech to censor and manipulate Americans.\n\nYesterday, Joe Rogan interviewed Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg.  During the interview, Zuckerberg casually admitted that Facebook algorithmically censored the Hunter Biden Laptop Story for 7 days following a request from the FBI to censor election “misinformation.”\n\nZuckerberg’s admission is a turning point in the battle for the preservation of the First Amendment and Free Speech in America.  It’s a political and legal earthquake.\n\nThe government’s collusion with Big Tech to censor Americans is decisively NOT CONSPIRACY THEORY, but FACT.\nhttps://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/08/major-update-missouri-ag-sch",
