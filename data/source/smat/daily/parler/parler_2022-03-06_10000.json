          "body": "That's bad news for the Orange One. Now this guy is cooperating with the Justice Department. With what the January 6 Committee filed w/a court in California court earlier tonight, Trump & all his goons are now fucked.  We now know the names of the people who were in the rum when trump was conspiring to steal the election.  Who would have thought none other than Jason Miller would turn on Trump. My guess is the real Deep throat the January 6th Committee is waiting to spring on trump is none other than his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out than all those close to Trump, Trump Jr. & his girlfriend, Ivanka & Eric. Jared is saying fucked Trump, he's not going 2 jail and forfeit his millions knowing that if the shoe was on the other foot Trump would throw him 2 the wolves N a heartbeat. Who know, Ivanka is as cut throat as her daddy. Sh's not going 2 prison 4 him either. Get ready 2 C the Trump family turn on each other. it's only business!     ",
