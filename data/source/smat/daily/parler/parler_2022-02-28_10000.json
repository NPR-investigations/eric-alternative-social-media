          "bodywithurls": "On February 8, Eric Lander, the chief scientific adviser to U.S. President Biden, resigned. An internal White House investigation found he bullied, demeaned and insulted employees in violation of U.S. government workplace conduct rules.\nIn his resignation letter to Biden, he wrote: \"I am deeply saddened by the way I talk to my colleagues that hurts them. What I say and how I express it sometimes crosses the line and is inappropriate for men and women alike. Respectful and demeaning.\" In the letter, he also said that his resignation would take effect no later than February 18. The White House press secretary said on the same day that Biden had accepted Rand's resignation.",

It was first implemented by his predecessor, Bill de Blasio, last year. However, he clarified Monday that there are no plans to remove requirements that workers be vaccinated.\n\nMayor Adams clarified that the requirement would be lifted on March 7 so long as COVID cases continue to trend downward.\n\nNYC's indoor mask requirement for all public schools will be lifted on the same day (again, provided no unexpected spikes in infections arise).\n\nAdams noted that more than a million students would return to public schools Monday after their February break.
