Tonight, while the Blue Jays were harassing Severino, I was astonished at the commentators' crew. Michael Kay (he is obnoxious even to many Yankees fans...) and Cameron Maybin (worst color commentator I have ever heard: 29.7 platitudes every 6 words) hosted in a clearly staged political stunt (35 minutes! Literally, no baseball game description for half an hour) the Mayor of NYC, Eric Adams (after he barely bested Fauci as ceremonial first pitch thrower). After this scandal, I am now considering quitting the Yankees. Even though Severino tried to do something as unusual as stopping the manager from replacing him early (vaguely reminiscent of Mussina doing it much more harshly to Joe Torre, but one out short of a close complete game). Sorry Adams, you ain't Giuliani. Boone ain't Torre. And you, Luis, you ain't Mike Mussina.",
