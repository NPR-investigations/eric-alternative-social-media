I don't think our country can survive three years of this administration. Over the last week, the wheels are really coming off this bus. \n\nWe also talked about the new Mayor in Boston. Her name is Michelle Wu. She may go down as the worst mayor in the history of Boston. She is implementing a vaccine ID mandate tomorrow in Boston. She has protestors following her everywhere she goes.\n\nShe had 30-40 people outside of her house this morning. There will be a march in Boston tomorrow to protest her tyranical mandates. Its time for the people across this country to demand an end to these mandates! \n\nThank you to Eric Kirk and Baa_Ram_Ewe_Podcast for calling in!
