Turns out a jury of predominately African Americans acquitted Darren Wilson. So in the past 7 years you have zero, yes Zero white on black racism. George Floyd was a case of police brutality, there was no evidence of racism, and the prosecution didn't even go after that angle to the unnecessary killing of Mr. Floyd.  Michael Brown? Justified self-defense.  Brianna Taylor?  Sadly she lost her life under a cross-fire from officers also acting in self-defense with company someone of her stature shouldn't have been keeping. The only truly known racist black on white or white on black killing in the last 7 years is the 6 white people including one small child by Darrell Brooks in Waukesha by someone with well-published hate for Caucasians.  No evidence, but Ahmaud Arbery murder has racist underpinnings.",
