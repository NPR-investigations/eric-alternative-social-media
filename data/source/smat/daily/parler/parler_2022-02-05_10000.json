It may have been whites 100 years ago, but who knows why it was in those days as few are alive from then to say... ,but IF you listen to the clapping , you know this validates that Blacks in that room,seem to prejudice + hate whites a lot who gave THEM equal opportunity, so.....who is any better than who might be the question? Have you no shame? But free speech is a right we cannot take away, so do you want a guy like this as the mayor who is proudest of having played the game where the end result was kickin police cracka ass, or someone who cares about curtailing crime rebuilding a blighted once beautiful city+ working together as a unit no matter what the color?? It doesn't sound positive to me, so, Maybe he was a bad choice, maybe not, but what is he going to do about the major mess he has been handed especially the problems with B on B crime in the communitys that affects everyone in NYC, as personally, I wouldn't even want to go there now because of? Will his tenure improve safety on the streets? Everyone is watching sir, and waiting to see how reverse racism is going to get whites who may not be racists he callls \" crackas\", unfairly , want to spend money at Black businesses he skims the 30% off the top to , after hearing this non plus rant, that now ,might¬† not want to continue living there, + would rather instead just move their money out to friendlier places like Fla. Where they fight crime, + not endorce it?",
