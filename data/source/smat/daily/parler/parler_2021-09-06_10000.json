          "body": "Healing Humanity: Confronting our Moral Crisis, a book from Holy Trinity Publications, features contributors who are Orthodox Christian clergy, professors, and prominent writers.\n\nThe book relates the sexual revolution of 1960s America to America’s new Cultural Revolution today. The latter offers a techno-totalitarian version of the Bolshevik Revolution, followed by its successor the Maoist Cultural Revolution in Communist China. \n\nThe new Cultural Revolution today, in separating individuals not only from family ties but in delusion from bodily limitation and personal relationships, also seeks to obscure the historic Church and the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.  It offers a new technocratic version of the ancient disembodied heresy of Gnosticism.\n\nSt. Irenaeus of Lyons (c.150) wrote \"Against Heresies\" as a critique of ancient gnosticism, but he offers an antidote to American techno-gnosticism today.  \n\nBreaking with the Hellenic duality of body and soul, Saint Irenaeus developed Saint John’s doctrine of the Word made flesh to interpret the meaning of the vocation of man. \n\nAs the first man, born into a virgin earth, fell, through the virgin Eve’s disobedience by a tree, so Christ came into the world through the obedience of the Virgin Mary and had been hung on the tree of the Cross. ‘He gave His soul for our souls and His flesh for our flesh, and He has poured out the Spirit of the Father to bring about the union and communion of God with men, bringing God down into men by the Spirit and drawing men up to God by His Incarnation.\n\nAppearing, not in His ineffable glory but as a man, He has shown in Himself the restored image of God, conformed once more to the likeness.   ‘It is impossible to live separated from Life, and there is no participation in life without participation in God, and this participation in God consists in seeing God and enjoying His sweetness…. For the glory of God is the living man, and a man’s life is the vision of God.\n\nAgainst such holy teaching and experience of embodied virtue, modern revolutionaries offer the false joy of dominance, exemplified in the works of the Marquis de Sade, extended by technological control in taking pleasure in self-destruction. Writer Vicky Osterweil’s In Defense of Looting, and Prof. Mark Bray’s Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, both ultimately advocate philosophies of violent anarchism in the service of revolution leading to totalitarianism.\n\nThe roots of today’s entwined movements of Antifa, Antiracism, Pansexualism, and the Anthropocene, lie in the atheism of Karl Marx and cultural Marxism.  The goal socially is to overthrow Christian sobornost, or spiritual unity and solidarity in Christ. The political philosopher Eric Voegelin saw these trends as technocratic gnosticism, evident in Nazism and Communism, but also in the movement toward the administrative state of liberal social democratic countries.\n\nBy contrast, sobornost in Orthodox Christian tradition is the intersection of mystical hierarchy and conciliarity in our Lord Jesus Christ. In sobornost, freedom is self-restraint, freedom from objectifying passion. Such freedom flows from service to universal truth, in the person of Jesus Christ. Sobornost in this Orthodox Christian tradition functions as a synonym for justice...\n\nSobornost derivatively was the historical basis of America as a constitutional republic “under God,” however dimly reflected in practice and deeply flawed.  \n\nTypes of systemic violence obscured by the current Cultural Revolution reveal the integral flaws of its atheistic materialism. These include the systemic violence of abortion disproportionately killing babies of color; the tragically high number of deaths of youths of color at the hands of other youths of color, often from broken homes in American cities; substantive issues about the poor state of America’s schools especially in urban areas; and the rising cultural and criminal depravity of sexualizing children. The most vulnerable suffer in systems where dissolute elites in effect cheer on social self-destruction. \n\nAcross American culture, developments such as the decline of marriage and rise of children outside of wedlock, ubiquity of cyberporn and taking sexual advantage of children, normalizing polyamory, and generally the pansexualizing of culture, all indicate the essentializing of passions at the expense of traditional norms of self-restraint in Christian traditions of the old republic.  The passions provide a context for erupting social violence and anarchistic politics.\n\nAcademia has developed since the 1960s into hotbeds of advocacy and activism rather than what C.S. Lewis would have called the “old learning” of the humanities with their cautions on the need for virtuous self-restraint. The morphing of humanities fields into race/class/gender studies ghosting “woke” social sciences, of Environmental Studies into revolutionary-technocratic Anthropocene and environmental-justice studies, and other late-twentieth-century “studies” fields of gender and race into ever-more-radical forms of advocacy and activism on the Left, leave little tolerance for dissent, which they classify as phobic madness and hate. To paraphrase Tacitus, “they make a desert and call it victory.”\n\nToday’s American “studies” fields advance cultural Marxism with hatred of traditional Christianity, shaping the culturally totalitarian ideology of the new global West.  The Green New Deal movement seeks to galvanize the election of hard-left Democratic officials nationally to gain control of levels of power in America. It now seeks to link its “anthropocene” view of cosmology — technocratic and devoid of God — to Critical Race Studies’ Antiracism, a natural fit for cultural elites building the current revolutionary coalition, and Pansexualism that seeks to eradicate traditional family. For years the official Black Lives Matter website had featured its opposition to the family.\n\nCritical Race Theory's self-contradictions reveal the quasi-religious aspect of the American Cutural Revolution today.  CRT masks the very totalitarianism of cultural Marxism, and ignores the ideological complicity of cultural Marxism in deaths of tens of millions in racial and cultural genocides in the past century under Communism, a hate-filled legacy that remains the American revolutionary Left’s great unacknowledged unreparated moral debt. And CRT ignores the companion “secularness\" seeking to eradicate traditional minority cultures in America.\n\nBehold the close ideological affinities between CRT and Antifa, with the latter’s principle of “pre-emptive violence” as a means to eradicate dissent and non-conformity, and both of them with the “environmental justice” of the Green New Deal movement, objectifying the identities of humanity within an atheistic technocratic frame of resource regulation, and of all of them with Pansexualism that asserts the non-essentiality of sex in a new technologically post-human world.  All seek to erase traditional Christian cosmology and anthropology as a public presence by equating them with hate, in efforts such as the Equality Act endorsed by the Democratic Party.  The latter would relegate public expression of traditional views of sex and family to illegalities. \n\nOrthodox writers Archpriest Josiah Trenham and Archpriest Peter Heers illustrate how the crumbling of Western faith in schisms and heresies contributed to the current new Cultural Revolution in America.\n\nThe full Incarnational sense of Christian theology is that embodiedness matters in our relation to God, and that our relation to God’s uncreated energies or divine grace is the very source of our identity and salvation as embodied individuals. In that lies the Orthodox Christian antidote to the technocratic Gnosticism of our age with its totalitarian bent.\n\nThe systemic evil that critical studies of all types seeks to trace involves ultimately the fallenness of human nature and its drive to power, influenced by demonic forces. Utopianism that would attempt to establish a perfect society in human or post-human technological terms is doomed to fail, as the classic totalitarian systems of Soviet Communism and Nazi Germany did in their own variant forms of twisted utopianism.\n\nThe anti-Christian spirit of the current American Cultural Revolution seeks to reject the Incarnation of God in our Lord Jesus Christ, and His One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, for the abstract and disembodied techno-gnostic spirit of Anti-Christ. The latter leads to isolation, terror, cultural totalitarianism, and loss of any remnants of the historically Christian-inspired sense of commonwealth in America.\n\nAs the Prophet David sang, a broken and a contrite heart God wilt not despise. May America’s trials be an opportunity for the spread of the Holy Gospel and the Orthodox faith, for the remission of our sins and the healing and salvation of our souls and bodies. Holy New Martyrs and Confessors of Russia pray to God for us!\n\n+",
