          "body": "Hochul Takes The Helm\n\nOn August 24, 2021, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation from office took effect and Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul was sworn in as the 57th governor of New York.\n\nA Buffalo native, Gov. Hochul is an attorney with a long and varied history of government service. Following stints as a staffer for other elected officials, Hochul was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Hamburg Town Board in 1994. She went on to win election to the Town Board four times, and served as a board member until she resigned in 2007 to become Erie County Clerk. Although she was appointed County Clerk by then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer to fill a vacancy, Hochul quickly broke with Spitzer on the issue of driver licenses for undocumented immigrants; when Spitzer attempted to implement that policy, Hochul threatened to have undocumented immigrants arrested if they applied for driver licenses in Erie County. Hochul was elected to a full term as Erie County Clerk in November 2007 and served in that capacity until she resigned in June 2011 to become a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nHochul ran for Congress in a May 2011 special election in New York’s 26th congressional district to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Republican Rep. Chris Lee. Although the district generally supported Republicans, Hochul defeated Asm. Jane Corwin in an upset victory. Following redistricting, Hochul was unseated by Republican Chris Collins in 2012. Hochul was endorsed by the National Rifle Association in her 2012 campaign for re-election. During her congressional tenure, Hochul developed a reputation as a moderate Democrat. She opposed portions of the Affordable Care Act but voted against its repeal. Hochul supported tax hikes for the wealthy, but she also voted for a Republican balanced budget amendment proposal and voted to declare Democratic U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to be in contempt of Congress.\n\nIn 2014, Hochul ran for lieutenant governor of New York as Andrew Cuomo’s running mate. During that campaign, Hochul moved in a liberal direction regarding gun control and immigration, portraying herself as a gun control advocate and a supporter of Gov. Cuomo’s controversial NY SAFE Act. The New York Times endorsed her primary opponent, asserting that “her willingness to shift politically does not suggest she would offer any kind of independent judgment.” Hochul was elected lieutenant governor in 2014 and re-elected in 2018. During her tenure as lieutenant governor, Hochul reversed her previous position by coming out in support of Gov. Cuomo’s proposal to provide driver licenses to undocumented immigrants. Hochul was also a strong proponent of the abortion expansion law known as the Reproductive Health Act. Hochul’s leftward shift has drawn comparisons to U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who underwent a similar (but more dramatic) metamorphosis. Significantly, Hochul did not speak out against Gov.

          "bodywithurls": "Hochul Takes The Helm\n\nOn August 24, 2021, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation from office took effect and Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul was sworn in as the 57th governor of New York.\n\nA Buffalo native, Gov. Hochul is an attorney with a long and varied history of government service. Following stints as a staffer for other elected officials, Hochul was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Hamburg Town Board in 1994. She went on to win election to the Town Board four times, and served as a board member until she resigned in 2007 to become Erie County Clerk. Although she was appointed County Clerk by then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer to fill a vacancy, Hochul quickly broke with Spitzer on the issue of driver licenses for undocumented immigrants; when Spitzer attempted to implement that policy, Hochul threatened to have undocumented immigrants arrested if they applied for driver licenses in Erie County. Hochul was elected to a full term as Erie County Clerk in November 2007 and served in that capacity until she resigned in June 2011 to become a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nHochul ran for Congress in a May 2011 special election in New York’s 26th congressional district to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Republican Rep. Chris Lee. Although the district generally supported Republicans, Hochul defeated Asm. Jane Corwin in an upset victory. Following redistricting, Hochul was unseated by Republican Chris Collins in 2012. Hochul was endorsed by the National Rifle Association in her 2012 campaign for re-election. During her congressional tenure, Hochul developed a reputation as a moderate Democrat. She opposed portions of the Affordable Care Act but voted against its repeal. Hochul supported tax hikes for the wealthy, but she also voted for a Republican balanced budget amendment proposal and voted to declare Democratic U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to be in contempt of Congress.\n\nIn 2014, Hochul ran for lieutenant governor of New York as Andrew Cuomo’s running mate. During that campaign, Hochul moved in a liberal direction regarding gun control and immigration, portraying herself as a gun control advocate and a supporter of Gov. Cuomo’s controversial NY SAFE Act. The New York Times endorsed her primary opponent, asserting that “her willingness to shift politically does not suggest she would offer any kind of independent judgment.” Hochul was elected lieutenant governor in 2014 and re-elected in 2018. During her tenure as lieutenant governor, Hochul reversed her previous position by coming out in support of Gov. Cuomo’s proposal to provide driver licenses to undocumented immigrants. Hochul was also a strong proponent of the abortion expansion law known as the Reproductive Health Act. Hochul’s leftward shift has drawn comparisons to U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who underwent a similar (but more dramatic) metamorphosis. Significantly, Hochul did not speak out against Gov. Cuomo’s corruption or misconduct until days before he announced his resignation.\n\nRead More\n\n￼\n\nRochester Briefing at Sweet Briar Lodge\n\nSeptember 17, 2021\n\nOneonta Briefing at Brooks’ House of Bar-B-Q\n\nOctober 1, 2021\n\nBuffalo Banquet at Salvatore’s Italian Gardens\n\nOctober 7, 2021\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\n￼\n\nBenjamin Announced As Hochul's Pick For Lt.

Back in 1940, the total population of this area, including the surrounding villages, was only about 5,000. Still, under the leadership of their Protestant pastor André Trocmé and his wife, Magda, the residents of these villages were responsible for saving up to 5,000 Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps during World War II.\n\nIn late January, Holocaust survivor Eric Schwam passed away at age 90. According to a BBC article, Schwam, a native of Vienna, arrived in Le Chambon in 1943, a refugee along with his mother, father, and grandfather. After the war, Schwam eventually returned to Austria to live a quiet life. However, he never forgot the people of Le Chambon for saving his life. In fact, he left the town more than $2 million in a bequest. \n\n \n\nAs Dr. Glenn Sunshine described in a BreakPoint article from a few years ago, in the winter of 1940, after the defeat of France, a Jewish woman fleeing the Nazis knocked at the Trocmé’s door, seeking help. Magda attempted to secure false papers for her, but the mayor refused to help. He feared that if the Germans found out anyone in Le Chambon was helping Jews, the entire village would suffer.\n\nThis did not dissuade Magda and André. In fact, according to Sunshine, “Pastor Trocmé began to exhort his congregation to shelter any ‘People of the Book’ that were fleeing Nazi persecution, telling them, ‘We shall resist whenever our adversaries demand of us obedience contrary to the orders of the gospel.’” The members of his church responded, volunteering to hide Jews. \n\n \n\nWhen more Jews arrived in Le Chambon, André would announce the arrival of “Old Testaments” and ask if any in his congregation would be willing to take them. There was never a lack of volunteers. Eventually, the townspeople created an underground network to help Jews travel safely across the Swiss border.\n\n \n\nLocal officials caught on and tipped off the Germans. They searched Le Chambon but found nothing. Finally, the officials demanded that Trocmé stop any and all activities that provided help for the Jews. His response was blunt. “These people came here for help and shelter. I am their shepherd. A shepherd does not forsake his flock. I do not know what a Jew is. I only know human beings.”\n\n \n\nEventually, André was arrested and sent to a detention camp. He was released after ten days and spent the rest of the war underground. Le Chambon’s rescue operation continued, even without him.\n\n \n\nWhat the people of Le Chambon did was, as Dr. Sunshine called it, “a conspiracy of goodness.” An untold number of lives were saved by their courageous actions. In fact, not a single Jew was caught in Le Chambon during the entire war.\n\n \n\nWhy did these French Christians risk so much? In a post-war documentary, one villager said, “We didn’t protect the Jews because we were a moral or heroic people. We helped them because it was the human thing to do.” \n\n \n\nBut of course, we have to ask ourselves, why did so many others refuse to help?\n\nAndré Trocmé died in 1971. His wife Magda died in 1996. Both were named as Righteous among the Nations by the Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes’ Memorial Authority in Jerusalem.\n\n \n\nA final, fascinating element of this story is that the residents of Le Chambon were descendants of French Protestants known as Huguenots, who were themselves victims of savage persecution at the hands of the French Catholic monarchy during the 16th and 17th centuries. A method of survival used back then played a major role in the 20th century work to protect Jews. Dr. Sunshine describes it this way: \n\n \n\n“In the area around Le Chambon, the Huguenots made secret rooms similar to the priest holes in England, and secret paths through the mountains to Switzerland to smuggle pastors and Bibles into France. Even after Protestantism was legalized, the people of the area kept the locations of these rooms and paths secret since they never knew when they would need them again. Providentially still available, the rooms and paths were put back into service to save the Jews from the Nazis.”\n\n   \n\nGratitude in Difficult Times\n\n G.K. Chesterton said that gratitude was “nearly the greatest of all human duties, (and) nearly the most difficult.” \n\nIt is the greatest of human duties because, as Paul wrote the Corinthians, “what do we have that we did not receive?” Truth, tradition, technologies, medicine, democracy, relative peace, are all things that were given to us by those who’ve gone before.\n\n \n\nAnd yet, to paraphrase Jesus, even pagans can give thanks when things are going well. Expressing gratitude in a year like this, is much more difficult. Things could have gone better. We mourn for our friends and neighbors who’ve faced sickness, financial struggles, and relational fractures throughout this year. \n\n \n\nGratitude in difficult times is what Jonathan Edwards called “gracious gratitude.” We give thanks, not just for what God has done for us and not for what we’ve received, but for who He is. This gratitude is relational, not conditional. Though our world may shatter, we are secure in the One who made us and who saved us, and we can never be separated from His love.\n\nHow to Have a Conversation: Basic Principles\n\nYou’re in a conversation with a friend or a family member, and it’s clear you have different values or convictions about a given topic.
