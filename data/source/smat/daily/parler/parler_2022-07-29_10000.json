Over 1000 years ago the Serfs (slaves) forced the land Barons in England to sign the Magna Carta -a document that set out some rules, obligations for a workable relationship between master and servant. Call it the first collective agreement that has morphed into government charters, Constitution, labor union contracts, etc. So why is wanting to become a serf, or slave, appealing to Gen Z meatballs?  The trend of #democratfools to acquiesce to Fascist / Marxist / Communist ideology, under the foolish pretense of progressive democracy escapes the inquisitive mind of enlightened intellectuals. Take heed of Eric Fromm’s insightful observation; “Man’s fear of the past is he was a slave. His fear of the future is he will become a robot.” Seems like #meyouus are on track to serfdom some 75 years later. Many do not know what they have till they have lost it. Good Luck. The swarming #democrats are killing Democracy.",
