A handsome young man with academic skills was a popular individual to become president!!!

He sure was a racists president including his wife!!! He succeeded to divide the country!!!! His foreign policy was a disaster !! He allowed the Russians to march into Crimea and take control of Crimea!!! He supposedly drew a line in the sand for Iranians and Russians not to cross --cross they did into Syria with no opposition from this president!!! He and his buddy Eric Holder created the fast and furious selling arms to members of cartel!!!! In a live mic he told the Russian to pass a message t Putin--''TELL VLADIMIR PUTIN AFTER MY RE-ELECTION I WILL BE MOR FLEXIBLE!!! WHAT DID HE MEAN??",
