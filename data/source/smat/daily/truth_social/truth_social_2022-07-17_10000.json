            "description": "A woman shot by police after trying to ram her car through a White House barrier was carrying a lockbox holding a passport, foreign currency and a Connecticut driver’s license. Court documents unsealed Tuesday reveal items police found during a search of Miriam Carey’s Infiniti and a lockbox inside the vehicle. The documents don’t reveal the significance of any of the items, which also included social security cards for her and her daughter. The 34-year-old Carey was shot Thursday after a high-speed police chase that began outside the White House and ended near the U.S. Capitol. Her 1-year-old daughter was inside the vehicle but was not hurt. A federal law enforcement official has said that Carey’s mental health deteriorated in the last year and that she had delusions President Barack Obama was in contact with her. Carey’s sisters, who live in Brooklyn, say they don’t believe she was delusional and that police could have handled the situation differently.",
