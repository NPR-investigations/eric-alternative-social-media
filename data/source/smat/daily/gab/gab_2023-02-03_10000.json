Here is the body of the email:Hello there Peter,Going to cut right to the chase here. With the media absolutely giddy over two black quarterbacks facing off in the Super Bowl what types of diversity efforts are going into the rest of the positions in the NFL?Do you honestly believe that Christian McCaffery is the only White athlete capable of playing running back in the NFL (serving as a teams primary runner)? Prior to McCaffery it was Peyton Hillis that was able to get his opportunity only due to injuries on the depth chart and a fair minded coach in Eric Mangini.With the retirement announcement of Tom Brady lets look back at the Patriots - Wes Welker, Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, Danny Woodhead, Chris Hogan were all instrumental parts of the New England offense during it's offensive heyday. Why isn't the league and college football seem to be at all interested in finding more players who looked like they do? All the above mentioned players broke through stereotypes and proved them to be untrue however the sports media, scouts, GMs and coaches continue to use those some tropes when discussing White athletes.If you don't believe go check out twitter and search for Iowa CB Riley Moss. If you do not know who he is - he's been one of if not the best cornerback in the Big Ten for the past few years and he is (gasp)White! He's currently at the Senior Bowl and clocked the fastest speed for a DB on the National team. During the first two practices he has been superb yet he still faces questions, jokes, depreciating comments from twitter users mocking him. The good news is people are waking up to this very real discrimination and denial of opportunities to White athletes.I'll give you a homework assignment for this draft cycle - follow the above mentioned Riley Moss, Purdue WR Charlie Jones and UCLA WR Jake Bobo. See how many racial stereotypes are used to describe them and then post your findings in your MMQB article the week before the draft. Maybe even interview them to ask them if they feel that being White has held them back from more opportunity? I know it's a big ask of you to do some actual journalism rather than parrot the safe topics of the day and tow the line.Also, the league rigged the AFC Championship game. Why would the refs miss the block in the back on the final punt return when they were throwing flags all over the field against the Bengals? Trey Hendrickson was being held on the last play that Mahomes ran out of bounds and Perine was in the vicinity of Burrow's throw for that intentional ground penalty.",

It’s been on Fox News for weeks.I’m pretty sure we’ve already covered it multiple times. Not sure why we’re covering it again.But hey – whatever.It’s a slow news day.New York Post:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A once-trendy Manhattan hotel has become a wild “free-for-all” of sex, drugs and violence after the city began housing migrants there, an employee claimed Tuesday.Row NYC worker Felipe Rodriguez — who told The Post earlier this month that migrants were throwing away “tons” of prepared food at the hotel — said the facility has now descended into “total chaos.“Chaos, total chaos,” Rodriguez told “Fox &amp; Friends” when asked to describe conditions at the hotel. “There’s no accountability.“There is no daily supervision to show these people that … ‘You don’t destroy your hotel. You are only there temporarily. This is not your home.“[The employees] endure a lot of disrespect from the migrants, and there [are] some nice migrants, but there’s too much alcohol, too much drugs and too much violence, and you have teenagers … going into the staircases and making out like it’s Lover’s Lane,” Rodriguez said. “This is a free-for-all.The hotel, which was converted to house the sudden flood of migrants into the city, is just blocks away from the Watson Hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, where dozens of asylum-seekers have been camped out for several days protesting their removal for new accommodations in Brooklyn.Rodriguez, who is a runner at Row NYC, said that the hotel workers have been the ones who end up paying the price amid the anarchy. He said he was forced to go on disability after he was injured trying to deliver a refrigerator through a “cluttered” room.Rodriguez told Fox that the hotel is making more money from the city than it would if it hosted guests.Row NYC did not immediately respond to the Post’s request for comment.Over 43,000 migrants have arrived in New York City since the spring, with some 26,000 housed in the city’s hotels, according to Mayor Eric Adams’ office.At a visit to the southern border earlier this month, Adams said migrants should be warned there’s “no more room” for them in New York as the price tag of of the crisis reached an estimated $2 billion.” In New York, you go there, you’re going to be living in congregate settings, that there is no more room in New York. That should be coordinated by our national government,” he told reporters.The 50 or so protesters outside of the Watson Hotel, who are all single men, are understandably upset that they are being upended from their three-star hotel where they were no more than two to a room for hangar-like conditions at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This immigration thing is absolutely a matter of barbarians inside the gates. It’s a tragedy.We’ve become so decadent and so domesticated that the only possible solution to our social crisis was to flood ourselves with savages to just rip things up.What do neocons say about the military when they want to sound edgy? They sound like they’re about to have an orgasm in their pants when they say it.“Kill people and break things.”That’s what we needed – death and destruction.We outsourced.",
