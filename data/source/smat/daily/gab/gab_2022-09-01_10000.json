We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",

As WUWT reported in our 2021 article Tesla: Nothing Says Customer Satisfaction Like 30Kg of Dynamite, EVs appear to be horribly unsuitable for places which suffer cold winters.It is not just the reduced range. Deep frost conditions appear to irreparably wreck electric vehicle batteries, unless the batteries are kept warm, so one slip-up, like forgetting to plug your EV in at night, or a prolonged power failure, and you could have a dead EV. Likely this would become a doubly unpleasant experience when you read the fine print in your insurance exemptions.",

These were mostly Black and White.\nWhen the families moved to better school districts it left the liberal cities a void.\nThat void was filled with illegal aliens.\nThis created inequalities and segregation. \nIt also led to drive-by-shootings and violence in the schools. \nGang wars pitted the immigrants against one another and blacks.\nTeachers wouldn't teach in violent cities and left those kids to be educated by subpar teachers.\n\nClimate alarmism was created by the United Nations and introduced to congress by Nancy Pelosi in 1992 as Agenda 21.\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/353\nThe United Nations wants to be unelected global leaders with open borders.\nPelosi made her open borders stance clear when in 2016 she flew to Mexico City and got former\nMexico President Vicente Fox to declare Trump voters as \"lazy drunks\".\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/pelosi-vicente-fox-plot-to-defeat-trump-mexican-calls-trump-voters-lazy-drunks\n\nCalifornia's Governor Newsom within a week after defending his recall, made a law by decree that every neighborhood would have to provide affordable housing. With low income high density housing comes public transportation, light rail, dedicated bus lanes, bicycle trails, removing lanes from streets.\n\nAgenda 21 envisioned returning land back to nature, which explains Obama's and Biden's land grab. \n\nObama:\nSince taking office, I’ve set aside more than 260 million acres of public lands and waters — more than any President in history.\nhttp://news.investors.com/politics-andrew-malcolm/102415-777311-obama-protecting-the-land-is-important.htm\n\nUnder guise of climate change, Biden wants to make 30% of U.S. land off limits Expanded government plan means he's coming for private property\nhttps://www.wnd.com/2021/09/biden-plan-means-coming-private-property-wants-make-30-us-land-off-limits/\n",
