A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party‚Äôs first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party‚Äôs first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party‚Äôs national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party‚Äôs Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President.
