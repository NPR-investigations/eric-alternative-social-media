Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

Also to obey Revelation 18:4'Come out of her, my people,' so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues;  Feel free to post political articles that show why we must come out of her. Not just mentally but physically. I want you to think community in the sense of the Free State Project, Hasidic communities, Amish communities, etc...  There is much to say on the topic. Just know this is not a new concept and only for those that are truly called by GOD and want to do his will. \r\n\r\nTHE GROUP IS NOT FOR DEBATING ! \r\nITS FOR MOTIVATION AND BEING ABOUT THE FATHER BUSINESS !\r\nONLY KINGDOM BUILDING ! \r\n\r\nNO SPAMMING.\r\nIF YOUR POST DONT MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO FORM COMMUNITY AS I STATED ABOVE.

In this age of deception, can we even trust anything we hear on the news?  In this group, you're going to hear things that many of today's average Christians may not understand.  That is because today's church is under very deep deception that Jesus told us to watch closely for in the last days.   If you are looking for much deeper insights into what is really going on, then this may be a group you want to join.   If you are waiting to be raptured away before the tribulation begins, you probably won't want to join this group.  ALL POSTING IN THIS GROUP SHOULD relate directly to last days events as prophesied in the Bible and ALL LINKS MUST HAVE AT LEAST A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS BEING LINKED TO.  All posts that do not relate directly to final days events as prophesied in the bible will be removed.  Haters/disrespecters will be banned, as will pretentious theological pontificators seeking to argue every nuance of every post.",

            "description": "This is a group for all Christians on Gab who choose to keep the seventh-day Sabbath (Seventh-Day Adventists, Seventh-Day Baptists, Messianic Jews, Torah Observant, etc). \r\n\r\nWhy do we observe the seventh-day Sabbath?The specific reasons vary, but generally we hold that the Fourth Commandment, written in stone, was never abolished or changed by Christ. Jesus/Yeshua/Messiah spoke often about <i>how<\/i> to keep the Sabbath, but throughout His life, and the rest of the New Testament, there is no Biblical command that changes the Sabbath day from the 7th to the 1st day of the week. Sunday observance in the Christian church has its origins in the pagan tradition of Sun worship and has no clear Scriptural foundation. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian Sabbath-Keepers choose to keep the seventh-day Sabbath holy in loving obedience to our Creator and Savior!<br><br>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sabbathtruth.com\r\nhttps://www.seventhdaybaptist.org/sabbath\r\n\r\nhttps://brotherlance.com/commandment/\r\nhttps://www.adventist.org/the-sabbath/the-sabbath-then-and-now<br><br>\r\n\r\nGroup Rules:\r\n1. Majority of your posts should be related to the Sabbath\r\n2. Theological discussions welcome, personal attacks are not\r\n3. Treat others in a Christ-like manner\r\n4. Do not be intentionally divisive or hostile<br><br>\r\n\r\nPost that violate these rules will be removed and users who break these rules will be banned at the moderator's discretion.

Hopefully, these creations resonate with others and give voice to our shared human experience. Portman is an advanced multi instrumentalist on finger style guitar, Dobro® and lap steel, performer, composer and songwriter based in the west of Ireland.  In addition, he also performs and composes music on the Violin.  There’s a wide range to his work – from the Blues, Irish melodies, swing, rag time through bluegrass to Indian ragas. His broad skill set along with an eclectic set of musical influences places him in a unique position as a performer composer and recording artist.  Tom’s musicianship is gaining renown both in Ireland and abroad for his one man shows and performances with a plethora of acts. Since 2015 he has been touring with Grammy nominated Louisiana slide player Dege Legg, whose music featured in Tarantino’s film ‘Django Unchained’.Appreciated by many artists, he’s supported the likes of Eric Bibb and Preston Reed. A long list of album collaborations offers a testament to his versatility, as does his Dobro playing on International feature film animation ‘The Ugly Duckling and Me”.In 2019 Tom became an endorsed Duesenburg Artist and received the Music Network Instrument Bursary towards a Duesenburg guitars ‘Fairytale’ Lap Steel.

After overwhelming backlash from the Right and the Left, which often compared the proposed board to the Orwellian government depicted in “1984,” the board was dissolved and its would-be chairwoman, Nina Jankowicz, was fired.The initial proposal of the Disinformation Board came just days after Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the world’s wealthiest man, announced his intentions to buy the microblogging platform Twitter and completely overhaul its censorship policies, which overwhelmingly target conservatives, in favor of a more Free Speech-oriented approach. Despite outrage from the Left and many Twitter insiders, Musk ultimately completed his $44 billion purchase of the company last week, and has already begun firing top executives.",

          "content": "@Jehovehisgracious Testament of Levi????????? Kidding, right? That's not even Scripture. Yuck! Hope that QUICKLY changes for your own sake!For anyone, praying this all helps. If there’s any “ammo” here that’s either wanted or needed, go for it. As Scripture implies: “Freely you have received, freely give”:A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.No thanks. Pass. Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Praying you do the same for your own sake! (Remember: You ultimately affect only you and forever’s a long time.) Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical.But, then again, everyone has a forever as well as a prerogative.Gamble at will.However, don’t forget what Scripture says, and several times at that:“Do not be deceived...”As is, people in THAT particular boat are in the process of being deceived.Tends to make one wonder why people gamble like that.There’s only one way to be saved, period (Mark 1:15, John 3:1-6).(SIDE NOTE: 100% of everyone’s born of water. Just think of every mom: Odds are that it got expressed at one time or another: “We need to get to the hospital. My water just broke.”)Jesus at Calvary is the only way anyone is ever forgiven, again, period (John 14:6, John 19:30 and Galatians 2:19-21).(ANOTHER SIDE NOTE: The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Because of Jesus and His substitute sacrifice at Calvary (Matthew 20:28, Mark 10:45), your forgiveness is justified and the wrath of The Lord is turned away from you. Logically, it’s followed by His resurrection which means you live because He lives (Matthew 28:6, John 14:19b, Hebrews 7:24-25). (Lest anyone forget that we are FORGIVEN through Calvary (John 19:30) but it’s His life which saves (Romans 5:10).)Forgiveness is once for all (Hebrews 10:14), and it means it’s past, present and future (John 5:24, John 10:28, 2 Corinthians 5:19, Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 2:13-14, 1 John 2:12, 2 Peter 1:5-9, Jude 1:24-25, etc. Only one is needed since there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.). There’s no need to “keep a tally” or “visit some confession booth”. That’s all above and beyond of how loved and accepted you really are and why you are told to love and forgive others in return (Romans 5:8).People come to Jesus to be forgiven and have resurrection life, not in order to have a fat wallet, great health, cool car, nice job, big house, etc.JOHN 6:29 (RSV)Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”https://www.biblegateway.com/",
