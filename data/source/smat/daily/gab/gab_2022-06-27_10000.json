Get a RINO hunting permit. There’s no bagging limit, no tagging limit, and it doesn’t expire until we save our country.”",

Roger Waters is a Marxist!.........George Roger Waters (born 6th September 1943) is a Communist musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Born to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. ----- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Roger Waters is a Marxist!.........George Roger Waters (born 6th September 1943) is a Communist musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Born to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. -------- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Roger Waters is a Marxist!.........George Roger Waters (born 6th September 1943) is a Communist musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Born to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. ----- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Roger Waters is a Marxist!.........George Roger Waters (born 6th September 1943) is a Communist musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Born to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. --- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Roger Waters is a Marxist!.........George Roger Waters (born 6th September 1943) is a Communist musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Born to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. --------- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. ---------- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Roger Waters is a Marxist!.........George Roger Waters (born 6th September 1943) is a Communist musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Born to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. --------- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Roger Waters is a Marxist!.........George Roger Waters (born 6th September 1943) is a Communist musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Born to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. ------ https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Roger Waters is a Marxist!.........George Roger Waters (born 6th September 1943) is a Communist musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Born to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water’s Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‘political activism’, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used “imagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money” and had “crossed the line into anti-Semitism” allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was “representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently”, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. --- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Now you become  NEO OR TRINITY and are fighting against the dark force to bring the whole mankind out of the dark into lightness.....don't forget to buy some leather clothes and cool sunglasses <br /><br />8. For every counter argument you use only two words: FAKE and CGI<br /><br />And don't forget to download as much meme pics you can find online for this topic so when a question you can't answer comes up, just pick one.....<br /><br />Now you are ready to compensate your miserable life with a conspiracy that makes no sense but it will give you the feeling to be important, like Neo or Trinity....<br /><br />Oh yeah I forgot......<br /><br />Before you post shit on the internet, don't forget to create fake accounts everywhere, and use only them to post your shit theory....otherwise your friends and family will put you in some institution<br /><br />Because they will think you are crazy but you aren't, just lonely.....oooooooh<br /><br />Now you can cry yourself to sleep .......oooh<br /><br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/yafer\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@yafer<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/Bfaithful1\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Bfaithful1<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/Dissident_1\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Dissident_1<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/Dernor\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Dernor<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/Georgejackson2472\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Georgejackson2472<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/neverforeverwhatever\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@neverforeverwhatever<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/FlatandStationary\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@FlatandStationary<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/Seen_It_All_Eye\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Seen_It_All_Eye<\/a>",

Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah, again the Hebrew Roots Movement and again Roman Catholicism. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, both Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of cults and those false religions.The wrong “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.)Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, The Word is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).A “cult” is deemed so since it claims to have faith in Jesus but it fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There’s also ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. (Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Eric von Anderseck of the Second Eighth Week Apostles (S8W), Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism and so on.)No thanks. Pass. Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 says that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man. Psalm 118:8 is at the center of Scripture for a reason.By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything” (“THE GOSPEL ONLY”, in other words – Keyword “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-21 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm )  is only qualified to teach the new covenant (study 2 Corinthians 3:4-11). Forever’s a long time.There are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.",

Sadly, both Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of cults and those false religions.<br /><br />The wrong “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.)<br />Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, The Word is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).<br /><br />A “cult” is deemed so since it claims to have faith in Jesus but it fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There’s also ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. (Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Eric von Anderseck of the Second Eighth Week Apostles (S8W), Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism and so on.)<br /><br />No thanks. Pass. Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 says that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man. Psalm 118:8 is at the center of Scripture for a reason.<br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything” (“THE GOSPEL ONLY”, in other words – Keyword “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-21 – <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>biblehub.com/greek/509.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> )  is only qualified to teach the new covenant (study 2 Corinthians 3:4-11). Forever’s a long time.<br /><br />There are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.",
