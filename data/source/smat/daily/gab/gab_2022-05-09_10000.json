A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party‚Äôs first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party‚Äôs first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party‚Äôs national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party‚Äôs Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‚Äòalternative‚Äô parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode‚Äôs running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle‚Äôs running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

Giuliani, who was mayor between January 1994 and December 2001, also poured scorn on the mayor's social calendar and continual partying - whether it be showing up at theatre premieres, heading to the West Coast to hobnob with celebrities and billionaires or posing at last week's New York Met Gala.'Adams hasn't done a damn thing,' Giuliani told The New York Post. 'So far, he's the biggest failure of a new mayor in America. He's the worst failure of any new first-year mayor in New York City in my lifetime.'Giuliani, who earned the title of America's Mayor after ushering the city through the horrors of 9/11 before becoming a punching bag for his support of Donald Trump, also suggested Adams should lie low when it comes to his social engagements until he has made some real progress.Last week, Adams headed to the West Coast but was so late in returning back to the Big Apple on Thursday that he had to cancel previously scheduled press events. Adams stopped to take in David Chappelle's show, where he witnessed a man rushing the stage to attack him.Adams didn't arrive home until late Thursday because of what his press shop called a 'last-minute flight cancellation.' The cancellations forced the mayor to miss several events, including a rally demanding he be allowed to control the city's school system. At the start of last week, he appeared at the Met Gala. He was also seen with actress Cara Delevigne and rappers A$AP Rocky and Common at various city events.'I didn't go to a Met gala until I got the city under control,' Giuliani explained. 'People should stop inviting him to events. Adams should be at City Hall and Gracie Mansion implementing plans that should have been implemented months ago.",

James Comer says Biden's son is a 'national security risk' and a top issue for voters - and finding out if Joe was involved in his deals is a priority if Republicans take back the House.The Kentucky congressman who will lead Republican investigations if the GOP takes back the House in 2022 is lining up Hunter Biden and the 'Biden crime family' as one of the main targets.Rep. James Comer, who is primed to take over as chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, says the president's son and his business associates have many questions to answer over his foreign deals and taxes.He says the White House will also be pressed on whether the president knew about any of the transactions and believes American voters are now coming around to the fact the Hunter scandal isn't a 'conspiracy theory' and are questioning the administration's ethics and transparency.Comer called Hunter a 'national security risk' and a 'grifter' who has built his 'business model' on 'selling access to his father', and believes Democrats see him as an issue leading up to the midterms.Outgoing press secretary Jen Psaki has consistently denied Biden has spoken to his son about his business deals and has referred to the Department of Justice when asked about the investigation in Delaware into tax offenses, money laundering and illegal lobbying for foreign clients.She has also declined to answer questions on the basis he doesn't work for the Biden administration.The Republicans are currently the minority in Congress, but dismal polls and mounting issues for President Biden and the Democrats point to them taking back at least the House in the November midterm elections. Comer and his colleagues are ready to get to work as soon as they take charge of the committees, and are lining up Hunter, his business partners and potentially staff in the administration.In an interview with DailyMail in his Congressional office at the Rayburn Building, Comer said: 'The narrative all along has been that Hunter was on his own and Joe Biden had no interest or knowledge of anything that his son was doing with respect to business. Comer also said that they have been asking for Hunter's business partner Eric Scherwin to provide information on the business dealings and his visits to the White House while Joe was vice president.White House records show Schwerin visited 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 27 times during Barack Obama's administration in 2016.'Hunters dealings are with always with countries that don't like us and with energy and interests that would be counter to American interests.'It's reflective in Joe Biden's policies to ban drilling in America and make it hard to get a permit to drill.'Is Joe Biden compromised by a Ukrainian energy or Russian oligarchs or Communist China?'These are legitimate questions. Hunter Biden‚Äôs a national security risk.'",
