          "content": "Cartman (part3)My original plan upon arriving back at Jimmys yard was to crawl through the open gate, make a left and slowly make my way between the old airstream trailers on my left hand side and the 3 or 4 old timey vehicles in more or less completed stages of restoration on the right. Then, make a broad sweeping right up a gentle incline, continuing the arc until I'm parallel with Jimmys house on my left at the top of the rise, and another trailer used for farm equipment on my right. I mean, that's what I would do. That way, from front to back it's level. It's just inclined sideways a bit. After securing the trailer I would have disconnected it from my Bronco and rested the hitch on a block of wood. Something I'm sure many of you have done yourselves. But that's not what happened. That's not what happened at all.Cartman, with a 16oz tallboy in one hand and a bent cigarette in the other hand, assumed full Mussolini mode, directing me with exaggerated hand motions and shouting at me to stop, go right, back up, forward around some auto frames, up by the tomato plants, back down the incline where I turned around and drove straight up the incline again and stopped right in front of Jimmy house. Nose to the farm equipment trailer instead of next to it. Which brings us back to...\"Are you SURE you want me to park it here?\"\"yes goddamit yes! For the SIXTH fucking time, park it you fucking jew!\"So I did.Cartmans \"thinking\" was that I should stay in the truck with my foot on the brake, engine off, parking brake engaged, engine in gear, but off. For.....safety. I twisted around and watched Cartman open the back, step onto the trailer and start unwrapping the connecting drag chain. He then tried to jump up and down to get the hitch off the ball without removing the cotter pin. He then wrapped the drag chain around his left arm and yanked with both hands. Then he decided to get off the trailer the chain was connected to. I was on absolute pins and needles. Then he popped the latch on the hitch....then.......then he stepped on the back bumper to jog it down and away from the hitch......held in place by the thinnest of cotter pins.....Cartman finally saw the cotter pin and with his right hand he pulled it free, pushed down on the back bumper and freed the trailer. It jerked upwards, the hitch  barely missing Cartmans chin as the front of the trailer went up and the rear slammed down into the dirt. Then the trailer jerked backwards, the recoiled energy from the rear bounce transferring into a bumpy roll as the trailer...observing the laws of physics Cartman was so blissfully unaware of, headed for the side fence at the bottom of the incline.I made eye contact with Eric for the briefest of moments as the drag chain attached to the trailer at one end snapped tight. It was still wrapped around his left arm. He was jerked up and back, back in a long arc that ended with a fully extended belly flop of manatee like proportions into the dirt, cacti, scorpions and sharp rocks the Good Lord, in his infinite wisdom, has peppered the land with for eventualities such as this. I simply could not believe my eyes. I lost my breath. I was beyond laughter. For a solid two seconds I watched Cartman being dragged face down through the dirt. Then I jumped out and gave chase. Except I couldn't. My legs were wobbly. I couldn't breath. I didn't have watery eyes, water actually squirted out of my tear ducts. Cartman was furiously screaming, acting as a human anchor for the rolling trailer. I caught up and slowed the loaded trailer down with a good 6 feet to spare from the fence where the incline petered out into flat prickly grass. I thought I was going to throw up from laughing so hard. Cartman, when he finally got up groaning, with a ripped shirt front and tattered pants, naturally blamed me.\"You FUCKING JEW!\"\"BLAH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA\" Was all I could muster. For quite a while actually, as when I was driving out of Jimmys yard half an hour later, he was just arriving and all I could do in answer to his inquires as to how the trip was, where his car was and where Cartman was...was to point over at that side of the yard and laugh. Snot running down my nose.....great, never ending heaving belly laughs that I still get to this day when I picture the round eyes of surprise on Cartmans face and the half formed expletive on his lips as he was yanked like a ragdoll into the Arizona sunset, and immortal legend.",
