We only ask that we avoid topics which may be awkward to talk about with your mother. If it's difficult to talk about with her then it's likely to be difficult to discuss here. <\/br><\/br>Posts are welcome to be wholly religious, political, or personal in nature or just plain fun.  Basically the purpose of the group is to share what's going on in the world or what's happening in your life and how it all relates to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\r\n<hr><br>\r\nThe following rules apply to the group and will be enforced:\r\n<ol><br>\r\n<li>All spam and any advertising in any form will be removed.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<br><li>Questions are welcome, agitators are not. Contempt for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints or it's leadership is not tolerated.<\/li>\r\n<br><li>Blocking group moderators will get you banned.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<br><li>Personal attacks will not be tolerated and the offending posts will be removed. Continued personal attacks will result in getting banned.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<br><li>Not really a rule but a request. Please post your sources. We love quotes but we ask that a source is also posted to ensure the quote isn't apocryphal and as a reference when we share the quotes among our friends.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<br><p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (unofficial Gab group) https://gab.com/groups/4784<\/p>\r\n<br><hr>\r\n<br>",

We will remove a post according to our interpretation (written by us) of the guidelines below. If there is any confusion, please DM.\n***My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” Ephesians 3:20 TPT\n\n***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING: Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\n\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\n\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\n\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \n\n***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else's well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? \n\nWith that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\n1. Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\n\n2. Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.\n\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\n\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \n\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\n\n***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\n\n***“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.” Numbers 6:24-27 ESV\n\n***Group Creator:  @Micaiah\nAdmins/Mods: @Shooglenifty, @riustan",

They believe that observers standing in the Southern Hemisphere of their spinning ball are literally upside-down relative to observers in the North, and that this is the only possible reason the Moon could appear inverted when viewed from opposite hemispheres.  Anyone can easily debunk this flimsy claim for themselves however by simply taping a picture of the Moon to their ceiling and viewing it from opposite sides of the room.  The Moon will appear right-side up when viewed from one end of the room and upside-down when viewed from the other.  There is no need for the entire room to be spherical, nor for observers to be standing physically upside-down relative to one another to explain this simple phenomenon.  On the Flat Earth model, the Moon as well as the Sun, are always located somewhere between the Tropics spending the majority of their time on or near the equator.  So just like the picture taped in the middle of the room, people viewing from the North will see the Moon appearing right-side up while people viewing from the South will see it appearing upside-down.  This phenomenon is therefore easily explainable regardless of whether the observers are assumed to be standing upside-down on a ridiculous spinning ball or right-side up on a logical level plane.
