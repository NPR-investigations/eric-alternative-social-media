And here we stand - fleeing to Christ as our only hope for salvation.\"I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.\" (Psalm 73)Here we stand, on the \"Five Solas\" of the great reformation in Christian theology - the \"Reformation.\"1. Sola Scriptura - The authoritative rule for religious knowledge, faith and practice is the Bible alone (and not the traditions of any church or other religious organization).2. Sola Gratia - We - all we descendents of Adam - are sinners by nature. In ourselves, we are dead and dying - and utterly helpless and hopeless to save ourselves. We are completely dependent on God's grace alone to save us.3. Sola Fide - By His great mercy, God is pleased to save those who have faith in the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ. The instrument of our salvation is faith alone (and not our efforts or work).4. Solus Christus - It is the work of Christ alone - His perfect life of completely fulfilling the Law of God, His atoning sacrifice of death on the Cross to pay for our sins, and His resurrection from the dead to conquer death - that is the only merit and basis for our salvation.5. Soli Deo Gloria - Our salvation is completely by and from God, and God alone receives the glory for our salvation.\"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it - the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction. for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.\" (Romans 3:19-26)The purpose of this group is to promote & elucidate reformed Christian theology, and in so doing, glorify God, encourage his people, and urge sinners to flee to Christ, our only eternal hope and comfort.",

          "content": "\"In this way you experience the workings of the divine. You can see the workings of creation directly. For all of you learn from your own experiences. These are your teachers, your gurus, in this world. And you attract to yourselves those experiences which you require for your own growth. So, I come to you to say that it is time to focus yourselves and your awareness, to be conscious of your activities and your thoughts and feelings, conscious of your projections. Only in this way can you create for yourselves the divine experience that you desire to have. Some of you are waiting quite patiently. Some of you are waiting quite impatiently for the manifestation of ascension to occur, thinking that at that point in time that your troubles will be over. Well, that's true, your troubles will be over at that point. But why live with trouble in the meantime? I think you could make good use of this time to expand yourselves, to purify yourselves to the point where you can have all of those blessings you have been waiting for in the present, rather than waiting for them in the future. You hold the key to all that you create. You hold the key to all that you are within your own hearts, within your own projections. If you are projecting from your heart you will be experiencing the manifestation of your missions on Earth, your true destinies will unfold quite magically and easily. If you are coming from mental confusion and experiencing the denser emotions, it is more difficult for your heart to project, with clarity, that which it desires to create for you. So, you are enjoying a mixture of experiences. Some are beautiful and others are somewhat chaotic or confusing. It is for you to learn from these experiences and for you to stay within the realm of your own heart emanation - that simple, innocent, child-like expression of love that you feel within you. It is from this center that you can create all that you desire. And all that you require will be given to you for the fulfillment of your purpose, for the fulfillment of your destiny.\"St. Germain, through Eric KleinChanneled Discourses from the Ascended Masters on Self-Mastery and AscensionVolume Two",
          "contentraw": "\"In this way you experience the workings of the divine. You can see the workings of creation directly. For all of you learn from your own experiences. These are your teachers, your gurus, in this world. And you attract to yourselves those experiences which you require for your own growth. So, I come to you to say that it is time to focus yourselves and your awareness, to be conscious of your activities and your thoughts and feelings, conscious of your projections. Only in this way can you create for yourselves the divine experience that you desire to have. Some of you are waiting quite patiently. Some of you are waiting quite impatiently for the manifestation of ascension to occur, thinking that at that point in time that your troubles will be over. Well, that's true, your troubles will be over at that point. But why live with trouble in the meantime? I think you could make good use of this time to expand yourselves, to purify yourselves to the point where you can have all of those blessings you have been waiting for in the present, rather than waiting for them in the future. <br /><br />You hold the key to all that you create. You hold the key to all that you are within your own hearts, within your own projections. If you are projecting from your heart you will be experiencing the manifestation of your missions on Earth, your true destinies will unfold quite magically and easily. If you are coming from mental confusion and experiencing the denser emotions, it is more difficult for your heart to project, with clarity, that which it desires to create for you. So, you are enjoying a mixture of experiences. Some are beautiful and others are somewhat chaotic or confusing. It is for you to learn from these experiences and for you to stay within the realm of your own heart emanation - that simple, innocent, child-like expression of love that you feel within you. It is from this center that you can create all that you desire. And all that you require will be given to you for the fulfillment of your purpose, for the fulfillment of your destiny.\"<br /><br />St. Germain, through Eric Klein<br />Channeled Discourses from the Ascended Masters on Self-Mastery and Ascension<br />Volume Two",

'There needs to be a system of not heavy-handedness, but going in and explaining to that store that, 'Listen, you can't do this,' give them a warning,' Adams said.But, he did caution that there may be some form of enforcement for those who 'refuse to adhere to the rules.' 'If someone refuses to get in line after receiving a slap on the wrist for illicit weed pushing, though, 'some form' of enforcement may be warranted,' Adams said.He continued: 'If they refuse to adhere to the rules, then you have to come back and take some form of enforcement actions, such as a summons, such as, you know, talking about their ability to sell alcohol,' he said.   The Mayor said $5 million has already been put aside in his executive budget proposal to provide support to New Yorkers on applications for recreational pot sales and cultivation licenses.On Friday, Adams wasn't high on the happy herb but appeared to be naturally euphoric as he mingled with the cannabis loving crowd on Friday at the Cannabis World Congress and Business",

I think eventually,' Maher told former Attorney General Eric Holder after being asked why President Joe Biden hadn't yet pushed for federal legalization of pot. 'I mean, it could be one of those freedom issues.'He also noted how Republicans opposed the marijuana legislation passed by the House in April because of its language surrounding racial equity.'Now I understand the impetus to want to, like, for example, if you're gonna have new businesses that are legal in the marijuana field, yeah, they probably should go to the people who suffered the most during the drug war,' Maher said. 'Republicans, of course, are saying this is a deal-breaker.' Maher alleged that although Republicans may support legalizing pot, they aren't going to endorse legislation riddled with racial undertones.'What do you want, half a loaf? If they said okay, no equity, is it better to have the law passed or changed or is it better to hold out for equity?,' he questioned. 'It's better to have the law changed,' Holder answered. 'Deal with the societal reality that we have and, you know, and try to make it as equitable as you possibly can, but I wouldn't want to stop the movement that I think makes sense for the sake of equity.' Maher also joked the GOP could get on board with the federal legalization of marijuana because some Republicans are directly tied to the business, such as former House Speaker John Boehner who is currently on the board of the cannabis company Acreage Holdings.'I mean, someone like John Boehner works for a marijuana company now,' Maher argued. 'And, of course, Republicans smoke lots of pot too.'Holder replied: 'Not enough. They need to mellow out just a little more.'Boehner joined the Acreage Holdings board in 2018 and later became the chair of the National Cannabis Roundtable, a pro-marijuana lobbying group.Similarly, a 2021 Quinnipiac University poll revealed that 62 percent of Republicans surveyed supported legalization of marijuana. Seventy-eight percent of participants who identified as Democrats also supported the measure.Regardless, only three GOP lawmakers - Florida Reps. Matt Gaetz, Brian Mast and Tom McClintock, of California - voted in favor of April's bill to legalize marijuana nationwide.",

They were both involved in campaign matters. They both have documents that they could offer. None of which is protected by privilege.And the idea that you can simply refuse to show up, rather than show up and say, as to this question I’m going to assert a privilege, that just invites others to be in contempt of Congress or be in contempt of judges around the country in other courtrooms. And I think it’s a very dangerous precedent to set.There are two glaring issues with his argument. The first is that Meadows and Scavino did cooperate, just not as much as he or others on the committee demanded. Take a look at what they turned over; it’s no small potatoes.Fox News:Meadows and Scavino entered into negotiations with the Jan 6 Committee and participated to a lesser extent than the committee requested, despite Meadows turning over over 9,000 documents, whereas Navarro and Bannon rejected the committee’s request outright on the grounds of executive privilege. In a statement, Navarro described the Jan 6th committee as a “kangaroo committee” with “7 partisan Democrats” and “2 RINO Republicans.”The other problem is that a legacy media outlet like CBS News isn’t going to give Schiff any pushback for his interpretation of what “cooperation” or the truth looks like. But, are you at all surprised?We reported last week on how, like the others, Navarro was indicted by the Biden Justice Department — and unlike former Attorney General Eric Holder, he was arrested “at an airport in the Washington, D.C., area and later appeared in court, where he faced two contempt counts.”As my colleague at our sister site PJ Media, Rick Moran wrote in May about this committee’s ongoing witch hunt, at that time against a Republican congressman for meeting with a constituent’s family last January 5, the day before the Capitol riot:“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” said astronomer Carl Sagan. He was referring to claims of aliens visiting earth, but he may as well have had the Democrats smearing Republicans with baseless charges of complicity in an insurrection in mind.This is a recycled smear that the Committee wants to regurgitate in the news lull before the public hearings begin on June 9.Indeed. And it’s one they intend to keep beating like a drum, as long as the news cameras keep the spotlight on them. But, hey, no more mean tweets, right?",
