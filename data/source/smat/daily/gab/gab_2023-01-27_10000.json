But the need to supply Kyiv’s armed forces prompted Pentagon leaders to triple production goals in September, and then double them again in January so that they could eventually make 90,000 or more shells a month.Unguided artillery shells have become the cornerstone of the 11-month-old conflict, with both Ukrainian and Russian troops firing thousands of howitzer rounds at each other every day, along a front line more than 600 miles long. These weapons are most likely responsible for the greatest percentage of war casualties, which U.S. officials have estimated at more than 100,000 on each side.The Army’s decision to expand its artillery production is the clearest sign yet that the United States plans to back Ukraine no matter how long the war continues.The ammunition the United States has sent to Ukraine includes not just the 155-millimeter shells for howitzers",

He deserved to get kicked off his committee after it was discovered that he was sleeping with Fang Fang, a Chinese communist spy. His lame excuse? He proudly claimed his district had a lot of Asians.

(No 1 wasn't mentioned as key in this video but i know Eric Metaxes, as far as his read his book and followed etc. so know if he is a true Believer, and i from what i know of him i know he is.. he would absolutely agree with these). No 1 - JESUS.. I say it again JESUS.. I say it again JESUS.. JESUS IS THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE, and THERE IS NO OTHER NAME UNDER HEAVEN BY WHICH ONE MAY BE SAVED.. No 2 - IF one believes No 1 and ACCEPTS HIM as SAVIOR AND LORD of one's life, then one will LIVE OUT THE ENTIRE WORD OF GOD.. ALL THAT IS WRITTEN IN GOD'S WORD.. (Unfortunately it seems there are two very ANTI-CHRIST SPIRITS, as i see it.. that leads one to believe SATAN -- the AUTHOR OF CONFUSION... One is to believe that there are \"many paths to God\" (so not believe the ENTIRE BIBLE.. that says, as No1 above.. that JESUS, JESUS, JESUS IS the ONLY WAY, ONLY WAY, ONLY.. TO GOD...), and, then there is the No 2 confusion (really just believing what \"feels good\".. as if can do anything want, claim even name of Jesus, and not only no repercussions for actions but even think are \"saved\".. perhaps do \"this good thing\".. like i believe  A LOT of what the Bible says, but i don't believe or just don't take seriously that other part.. BOTH OF THESE ARE NOT ONLY OF SATAN - THE AUTHOR OF CONFUSION - BUT the TRUTH is that ONE IS NOT SAVED.. NOT SAVED from the GREAT JUDGEMENT DAY.. as by just \"doing this or even many good works\" yet not surrendering ENTIRE LIFE TO LORDSHIP OF JESUS.. PROCLAIMING JESUS AS SAVIOR AND LORD OF ONE'S LIFE.. ONE is not only living in Satan's deception but deceiving others whom he or she may try to get to follow him or her in this way of thinking. the FULL TRUTH (not DECEPTION.. a \"bit of truth\" with a WHOLE LOT OF LIES.. like in GARDEN OF EDEN.. HASN'T CHANGED..) is TO TRULY KNOW THE ONE AND ONLY TRUE GOD and TO LIVE ONE'S LIFE FOR HIM (Thus making Him - Jesus - SAVIOR and LORD of one's life), one must ACCEPT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST into one's life.. AKNOWLEDGING JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY.. There is NO OTHER \"GOD\" by which one can be saved.. AND if one has made a sincere heart commitment (like the real marriage covenant relationship), then one's heart is committed to A LOVE RELATIONSHIP.. Jesus said \"If you love me, you will obey my commandments\".. This is just one reference of so many, when take WHOLE BIBLE IN CONTEXT to tell us that we WILL OBEY - read His Word, allow the Holy Spirit to convict and speak to us about all things, and have a heart to follow and walk as Jesus did) if we truly have entered into a covenant love relationship with Jesus. We may \"fail\" at times, but we always have a heart to learn and keep trying. Two KEYS: MAKE JESUS as SAVIOR and LORD of one's life, and LIVE IN A LOVE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM",
