Though there are plenty of Romans 1:18-32 effected/affected people who falsely say otherwise. I challenge any gray area “truth” believers.\r\n \r\nPeople often make “truth” out of thin air. However, there is only true or false. Though some truths are only viable in Jesusly people.\r\n\r\nThe first truth of life is, Jesus is risen...\r\n\r\nThe second truth of life is, to be a democrat, RINO, Never Trumper, leftists, socialist, \"But then I repeat myself,\" is to be ignorant and/or stupid, and/or corrupt. You can't be a leftist and be bright or moral. It's just not possible. These people equate to hate, slander, defile... Nothing less, because bad trees cannot bear good fruits. \r\n\r\nKing Solomon said, Wisdom is knowing true from false... \r\n\r\nTerry Goodkind said, People believe what they want to believe out of willful ignorance, or fear that something may be true, or that they simply want something to be true.   \r\n\r\nI have already written 192 Truths of Life... Check us out every now and again and eventually see them all.\r\n\r\nThis Group is dedicated to truth, and brighter ideas from brighter people. Most Truths of Life cannot be proven in scientific proper by scientific method, however they are true nevertheless… This group will dedicate itself to these truth with research, study, debate, essay, and evidence.

Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

But right now I am asking that you be praying for them!  Here is their situation: BREAKING NEWS HERE IN MONTANA 5 Christian Missionaries have been assaulted and then arrested near Ennis Montana. Pastor and missionary Jesse Boyd has been walking across the United States carrying a small cross and at times an upside down American flag (America is in distress). Jesse's 18 year old daughter Bethany Boyd, 12 year old son Josiah Boyd, and two other Christian brothers, Eric Trent and Carter Phillips, were traveling between West Yellowstone Montana and Ennis Montana Saturday, when a local rancher pulled his truck in front of a vehicle driven by Carter and Bethany who were just a short distance ahead of the others who were walking. The rancher got out of his vehicle yelling insults and telling them that they weren't welcome in Montana and to leave. As Jesse and the others approached the vehicle, the rancher had become very confrontational and even threatening. The situation quickly escalated as Jesse and the others walked up to the parked vehicles. The rancher attacked Jesse pushing him into the truck and then knocking Jesse to the ground and proceeding  to sit on top of him, knocking Jesse's glasses off, breaking them and hitting Jesse. During the scuffle Jesse's leg was cut, drawing blood. I should note that the rancher didn't have to stop and could have just kept driving. Instead, the rancher stopped and initiated confrontation. The missionaries only acted in total self defense. Jesse was able to get free and he and the others got into the vehicle, called 911 and waited just a couple hundred feet up the road away from the rancher. The Madison county sheriff's department arrived, told them to wait right there till they talked to the rancher, and after a brief talk with the rancher, several armed officers returned with guns drawn, ordering them out of the vehicle at gun point and placing them all face down into the snow, handcuffing and arresting Jesse, Bethany, Carter and Eric on felony assault charges. Josiah was placed in the custody of CPS foster care. All have been held since, without bond. Their first court appearance will be via video and will be tomorrow morning between jail to the Madison county courthouse at 9am Nov.15, 2022. Madison county doesn't have a jail so Eric is being held in Jefferson county jail, Jesse and Carter are being held in Gallatin county jail and Bethany is being held in the women's facility in Gallatin county.  Jesse has walked over 5,400 miles within this last year, handing out Bibles preaching the gospel and being a servant of God, not one of these missionaries have had any such previous encounters. They have always been peaceful, teaching all who are willing to hear.  This is an assault on religious freedom and an assault on the first amendment of the United  States constitution. How can you help? What things do these missionaries need? Their vehicle has been impounded. They will need lawyers, and bond once bail is set. Pray for them as they sit in bonds, pray for their families at home, pray for justice and for their quick release.  Check out their ministry website, and share their story far and wide.

A false flag is when an event actually occurs that can involve real casualties (such as 9/11, USS Liberty, Operation Gladio etc.) which is blamed upon a selected enemy to further a political (or geopolitical) agenda. A hoax or a fake shooting is a completely staged event where there are no deaths; the event is strictly theatrical, utilizing crisis actors and the Jew-run media to carry the narratives they want embedded into your mind. This is a platform to share research and insight concerning the theatrical productions that are fed to the masses to control their perception of reality. \r\n FAKE MASS SHOOTINGS Presentation by Darrell Rowlands and myself, featuring 13 hoaxes performed between 2012 and 2017. https://onegreatworknetwork.com/darrell-rowlands/fake-mass-shootings-part-1-2017",

The latest travesty is that, after the judge heard Andy Ngo’s case against an Antifa activist whom Ngo filmed throwing a liquid at him and grabbing his phone, the judge not only gave the activist a pass, but the judge also scolded Ngo for daring to report Antifa activities.Most people who followed Antifa’s activities in Portland, whether leftists or conservatives, are familiar with Andy Ngo. At great risk to himself, he reported what the Antifa gang was doing, whether silencing conservative speech, going to war against the city, state, and federal government in Portland, or physically attacking conservatives, including Ngo himself. In every case, Ngo has always had the video to prove that these attacks were real.In May 2019, Ngo filmed John Hacker, an Antifa member, who throw a liquid at Ngo, threatened Ngo’s property, and then seized that property, returning it only when gym members implored him to do so:The encounter at the gym was recorded by Ngo on his cell phone more than three years ago, and was finally played in court. The shaky video is less than 30 seconds long, but prosecutors say it’s a key piece of evidence showing Hacker approaching Ngo, grabbing the device, and yelling, ”I will break your f*cking phone.”",

And Mitch McConnell could have started a campfire with his glare after a top Republican dropped three words.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is trying to hang on to his job as top GOP boss in the U.S. Senate.After a disappointing Midterm election cycle, control of the Senate will stay in Democrats’ hands. When Senator McConnell could have had easy sailing regaining the title of Senate Majority Leader, instead McConnell has quickly lost credibility among conservatives.McConnell’s failures leading the Senate GOP—including on Democrat’s gun control and so-called “infrastructure” spending schemes he agreed to earlier this year, not to mention failing to set a clear message for the Party to campaign on in the Midterms and his complete disregard for planning for the actual mechanics of elections conducted under mail-in balloting—resulted in a disastrous outcome for the Party on Election Day. And all that was prior to McConnell alarmingly yanking funding from potentially competitive Senate races in the final months before the elections.Now, two Senate Republicans are saying it’s time for the GOP to move on from Mitch McConnell.Both of Missouri’s Republicans Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Senator-elect Eric Schmitt (R-MO) have come out against McConnell keeping his leadership position. At one of Schmitt’s campaign rallies prior to the Midterm elections, Senator Hawley told a group of reporters that he won’t be supporting the Kentucky Senator going forward.“I don’t imagine I will, no,” Hawley said, referring to voting for McConnell in the Senate Republicans’ upcoming leadership elections.So far, no Republican Senator has officially challenged McConnell’s leadership position.“I’m not sure if any other Senator will run or not,” Hawley said. “Nobody’s indicated they would. But my view is that we need new leadership in that position.”When asked who the next Republican Senate leader should be, Hawley replied, “Not Mitch McConnell.”Missouri Senator-elect, Eric Schmitt campaigned on promising he would oppose McConnell continuing to lead the Senates.“Mitch McConnell hasn’t endorsed me and I don’t endorse him for leadership,” Schmitt explained in July.When asked recently how he will vote in the next leadership election, Schmitt remained firm.“I said what I said, and I stand by those comments,” Schmitt said. Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) has emerged as a leading name who could be in a position to challenge McConnell. Scott served as Chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and is credited with playing a big role in boosting the Republican Senate candidates McConnell abandoned this year. It’s telling that Senator Scott refused to endorse Senator McConnell for leadership during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press.During the interview held prior to Election Day, host Chuck Todd asked Scott if he planned to run for leader if Republicans won the majority.“I’m not focused on anything except getting a majority Tuesday night,” Scott answered.Todd remarked that Scott’s response was a “non-answer.”“It’s a possibility,” Todd noted and Scott didn’t take issue with that remark.For months rumors have been circulating that if anyone has a chance of defeating McConnell as Republicans Senate leader, it’s Senator Scott.Donald Trump suggested that Rick Scott would be a better alternative to McConnell’s disastrous leadership.“This guy does not deserve to continue to be leader and hopefully somebody’s going to challenge him,” Trump said in a radio interview referring to McConnell. “But I’ll tell you, if I run, and if I win, he will not be leader.”After disappointing Midterm elections, Republican opposition to Mitch McConnell is swelling.https://politicalanimalnews.com/mitch-mcconnell-could-have-started-a-campfire-with-his-glare-after-a-top-republican-dropped-three-words/?utm_source=pannl&amp;utm_medium=ong&amp;utm_campaign=1653542388",

          "content": "https://americafirstreport.com/elections-were-stolen-do-not-let-them-gaslight-you-into-thinking-otherwise/ Never in modern history have the polls been wrong by FAVORING Republicans heavily. Polls favor Democrats by 3%-6%, so in any race that’s close in the polls, Republicans have a better chance of winning it than the Democrat because real results for the GOP outperforms polling. We saw a clear example of this in Florida where polls that favored Republican candidates underestimated their victories while polls that favored Democrats, such as the race between Eric Lynn and Anna Paulina Luna, were wrong. Luna defeated Lynn by 8-points despite the final two polls showing Lynn slightly favored.That’s how things are supposed to go, but this last election was different. Very different. Inexplicably and undeniably different. Instead of close races going to Republicans, they defied every election in modern history and went to Democrats. Even candidates who were clearly winning in the final polls, such as Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake or Pennsylvania senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, had their fortunes reversed.But here’s the catch. The red tsunami that everyone and their dog predicted was only thwarted in states where voter fraud is essentially permitted through loose voter ID laws, ubiquitous mail-in balloting, ballot harvesting, and unchecked vote counting practices. States that have stricter laws such as Florida and Ohio saw the predicted red wave. States where voter fraud is de facto legalized like Arizona and Pennsylvania saw inexplicable “wins” for corrupt Democrats.Unfortunately, we’re not hearing about this from most in conservative or alternative media. Instead, we’re hearing excuses. For example, I’ve seen many conservative pundits that I used to respect claiming that the abortion issue is what caused the failure of the red tsunami. This is unambiguously false for one important reason. Nobody woke up on election day and said, “Hmm, I know I was going to vote for Republicans and told the pollsters I was voting for Republicans just yesterday, but today I remember Lindsey Graham wants to create a nationwide abortion ban so I’m going to vote for Democrats instead.”",
          "contentraw": "<a href=\"https://americafirstreport.com/elections-were-stolen-do-not-let-them-gaslight-you-into-thinking-otherwise/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>americafirstreport.com/elections-were-stolen-<span class=\"invisible\">do-not-let-them-gaslight-you-into-thinking-otherwise/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a> <br />Never in modern history have the polls been wrong by FAVORING Republicans heavily. Polls favor Democrats by 3%-6%, so in any race that’s close in <br />the polls, Republicans have a better chance of winning it than the Democrat because real results for the GOP outperforms polling. We saw a clear <br />example of this in Florida where polls that favored Republican candidates underestimated their victories while polls that favored Democrats, such <br />as the race between Eric Lynn and Anna Paulina Luna, were wrong. Luna defeated Lynn by 8-points despite the final two polls showing Lynn slightly <br />favored.<br />That’s how things are supposed to go, but this last election was different. Very different. Inexplicably and undeniably different. Instead of close <br />races going to Republicans, they defied every election in modern history and went to Democrats. Even candidates who were clearly winning in the <br />final polls, such as Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake or Pennsylvania senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, had their fortunes reversed.<br />But here’s the catch.
