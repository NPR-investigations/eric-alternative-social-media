The military heads are all co-opted too. Illegal Aliens swarming the border could stop in a New York City minute. Most of the illegals carry cellphones. Rothschilds in China have jacked absolutely everything electronic. That is how they pulled off the stolen election, but the Post Office has long been an espionage tool of the Rothschilds. So, if Russia turned off their cellphones, the Chinese wouldn’t be able to strike them with what China is getting to the Ukrainians using the occupying forces of the US. DHS, CIA, FBI, IRS, the FED, NSA, CDC, N.I.H., United Nations, Int’l Police &amp; Teachers Union all answer to the Rothschild Big Pharma Central Bankers. What the Russians are getting now is what DARPA, B.A.E. Nashua New Hampshire, Raytheon, Boston &amp; California area defense contractors developed to go after the American people in America. Look at the fence around DC. The Rothschild heads actually thought the riots they tried to start w/ the FBI would go country wide &amp; they could attack all Americans using their cell phones. Flying exploding robot drones would have been a thing in America. <br /><br />So, the flood of illegal aliens carrying Fentanyl, Heroin, &amp; weapons by military age illegals are staging to the DHS run by the Rothschild can do door to door gun &amp; child confiscation in America. The Rothschild DARPA weapons are being used on Russia.<br /><br />China is having a proxy war with Russia. Rothschilds want revenge on Russian for torturing Tier 2 Nazi Looters steeling the remaining largest gold reserves, art, treasures, &amp; collective stored knowledge in salt mines mainly in China. <br /><br />Rothschilds are baiting Russia to nuke the US. Then Rothschild could takeover what remains the plan. Joe Kennedy was going to provoke a nuclear war between Russia &amp; US in 1968. But the original “Big Guy” getting 10% of US Gold Reserves shipped to China had a stroke in 1961. <br /><br />Joe had China fix the 1960 Elections Plural w/ Heroin deals w/ China. That is why his 2 sons got whacked. Payment &amp; favors weren’t made for heroin. <br /><br />We are no longer a country. We lost the War of 1812 which coincides w/ the Psy-Op that the Rothschilds ran after the Battle of Waterloo 1815 to take over the British Empire. Rothschilds then used Opium to rule the world. There 200 year plan from 1815 is your COVID Green Lock Downs to wipe out over 95% of the population. <br /><br />Get a job surface dweller ... <br /><br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/SvenVonErick\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@SvenVonErick<\/a> <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.bitchute.com/channel/Db53P0QqcpED/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>bitchute.com/channel/Db53P0QqcpED/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

The bottom line is they realistically have no idea what they’re talking about. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of those types of “salvation by works” cults and false religions. On the other hand, Titus 3:9-11 is aimed directly at Judaism and contains instructions for those born again regarding those wrapped up in it.(SIDE NOTE - Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). The Lord is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.",

The timing of the DEA raid and the fact that criminal charges were never filed against Ablow, coupled with whistleblowers’ claims that the FBI buried evidence against Hunter Biden, raises the question of whether the search was a pretext to recover Hunter’s laptop and protect the Biden family. While the DEA’s recovery of the second Hunter Biden laptop escaped scrutiny over the last nearly three years, a Washington Post article from Saturday brings that laptop into focus — and with it questions about the DEA’s seizure of the laptop and agents’ decision to return it to Hunter. In a weekend article titled “Some Hunter Biden Allies Making Plans to go After His Accusers,” The Washington Post reported that Hunter and his closest advisers are plotting an offensive for when Republicans assume control of the House of Representatives in January. The strategy sessions to counter what Biden associates frame as “an expected onslaught of investigations by House Republicans” began last September, according to the Post, with a meeting at the California home of Hunter Biden’s friend and lawyer Kevin Morris. Morris, already famous in the entertainment industry as an attorney for the co-creators of “South Park,” gained notoriety when the New York Post reported that Morris “footed Hunter Biden’s overdue taxes totaling over $2 million.” In addition to Morris, David Brock, a liberal activist, reportedly joined in the September 2022 strategy session. “At one point, Hunter Biden himself happened to call into the meeting, connecting briefly by video to add his own thoughts,” according to the Post. While not detailing Hunter’s purported thoughts, The Washington Post reported that Morris suggested “it was crucial” “for Hunter Biden’s camp to be more aggressive.” According to Saturday’s article, Morris then described during the September meeting at his California home the “defamation lawsuits the team could pursue against the presidential son’s critics, including Fox News, Eric Trump and Rudy Giuliani.” Morris also reportedly “outlined extensive research on two potential witnesses against Hunter Biden — a spurned business partner named Tony Bobulinski and a computer repairman named John Paul Mac Isaac.”Brock provided more insight, telling the Post: “They feel that there is a whole counternarrative missing because of the whole Hunter-hater narrative out there.” “What we really got into was more the meat of it, the meat of what a response would look like,” Brock said of the September meeting. To aid the efforts, Brock planned to start a new group — since launched — named Facts First USA, which Brock described as a “SWAT team” designed to “ensure that the media and public do not accept the false narratives that flows from congressional investigations.”More recently, according to the Post, “Brock’s group, Facts First, is engaging with Hunter Biden and those in his immediate circle.” Brock is reportedly “reviewing research that Morris has conducted on Biden’s adversaries, including Bobulinski and Mac Isaac.” According to The Washington Post, Morris and others are also focused on whether the data claimed to be recovered from the laptop Hunter Biden abandoned at the Delaware computer repair store, “was improperly obtained and distributed,” with Hunter and his allies suggesting that the materials released by Giuliani and others may not have originated from the laptop Hunter abandoned at the repair shop. Instead, the help-Hunter crew posits that the information may have been improperly taken from a laptop Hunter left with Ablow, whom the Post frames as “close to Republican activist Roger Stone.” The Post then reported that “Morris has been overseeing a forensic analysis of that laptop to determine if it was the basis of the hard drives that were later distributed by Trump allies.” Morris began floating a similar tangled conspiracy theory in May 2022, with CBS News reporting, “Morris and his team have been circulating provocative slides that tease a coming counter-narrative to political attacks against the president’s son.” The slides describe a “contextualized theory” positing that “there was no laptop dropped off with Mac Isaac, just a laptop which Hunter abandoned on Feb. 1, 2019, at the office of his psychiatrist, Dr. Keith Ablow.” A lot more: Keep reading.https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/12/did-the-dea-raid-hunter-bidens-former-shrink-to-scoop-up-a-second-laptop/",
