Back in June 2020, the Michigan Freedom Fund sued Benson and 16 other county clerks for neglecting to maintain accurate voter records. Benson is also known for inflating Michigan’s voter rolls: in September 2020, she sent out automatic voter registration forms to all eligible citizens.

The new policy is the result of a law passed in 2021 that requires the state government to limit its ties with anti-oil companies. As a result, the government requested information from over 100 companies to determine their stances on fossil fuels.The ten companies that currently fall under this new ban are: BlackRock Inc.,UBS Group AG, BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, Danske Bank A/S, Jupiter Fund Management Plc, Nordea Bank ABP, Schroders Plc, Svenska Handelsbanken, and Swedbank AB. BlackRock in particular has come under heavy scrutiny in recent years due to its extreme emphasis on so-called “environmental, social, and governance investing” (ESG), a new international practice that sees companies receive a certain score based on how much they invest in green energy, racial and diversity-based quotas, and other far-left practices.Hager said that the list of newly-banned companies will serve to “create some clarity for Texans whose tax dollars may be working to directly undermine our state’s economic health.”“A diverse energy portfolio is necessary for Texas to meet our future energy needs, and a vibrant Texas oil and gas industry is a stabilizing force in today’s economic and geopolitical environment,” Hegar said in a statement. “My greatest concern is the false narrative that has been created by the environmental crusaders in Washington, D.C., and Wall Street that our economy can completely transition away from fossil fuels, when, in fact, they will be part of our everyday life into the foreseeable future.”In response, BlackRock released a statement accusing Hegar of “politicizing state pension funds,” and declaring that the decision is “not a fact-based judgment.”“BlackRock does not boycott fossil fuels – investing over $100 billion in Texas energy companies on behalf of our clients proves that,” the company added. “Elected and appointed public officials have a duty to act in the best interests of the people the[y] serve.”",

            "description": "„Aber es war auch klar, daß ein allgemein wachsender Wohlstand das Bestehen einer geordneten Gesellschaft bedrohte, ja tatsächlich in gewisser Weise ihre Auflösung bedeutete. In einer Welt, in der jedermann nur wenige Stunden arbeiten mußte, in der jeder genug zu essen hatte, in einem Haus mit Badezimmer und Kühlschrank wohnte, ein Auto oder sogar ein Flugzeug besaß, in einer solchen Welt wäre die augenfälligste und vielleicht wichtigste Form der Ungleichheit bereits verschwunden. Wurde dieser Wohlstand erst einmal Allgemeingut, so bedeutete er keine Vorzugsstellung mehr. Es war zweifellos möglich, sich eine Gesellschaftsordnung vorzustellen, in der Wohlstand im Sinne von persönlichem Besitz und Luxusartikeln gleichmäßig verteilt war, während die Macht in den Händen einer kleinen privilegierten Schicht lag. Aber in der Praxis würde eine solche Gesellschaftsordnung niemals lange Bestand haben und die leitenden Kräfte der Weltpolitik wollen dies auch in keiner Weise, denn ihre Macht liegt in der Beherrschung des Geldes und der Rohstoffe begründet. Zu einer ackerbautreibenden Vergangenheit zurückzukehren, wie es einige Denker zu Anfang des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts erträumten, war keine ausführbare Lösung. Sie stand im Widerspruch mit der fast auf der ganzen Welt gleichsam instinktiv gewordenen Mechanisierungstendenz, und außerdem war jedes industriell zurückgebliebene Land in militärischer Hinsicht hilflos und dazu verurteilt, direkt oder indirekt von seinen fortschrittlichen Rivalen beherrscht zu werden. Auch war es keine befriedigende Lösung, die Massen dadurch in Armut zu erhalten, daß man die Herstellung von Gebrauchsgütern abdrosselte, wie es in den Jahren vor der Revolution kurzzeitig versuchte. In vielen Ländern ließ man damals die Wirtschaft zum Stillstand kommen, die Felder blieben unbebaut, veraltete Maschinen wurden nicht ergänzt, große Teile der Bevölkerung wurden der Arbeit entfremdet und durch staatliche Unterstützung gerade noch am Leben gehalten. Aber auch das brachte militärische Schwäche mit sich, und da die damit verbundenen Opfer offensichtlich unnötig waren, erhob sich unvermeidlich eine Opposition. Das Problem bestand darin, die Räder der Industrie sich weiter drehen zu lassen, ohne den wirklichen Wohlstand der Welt zu erhöhen. Verbrauchsgüter mußten zwar produziert, durften aber nicht unter die Leute gebracht werden. Und in der Praxis war der einzige Weg, dieses Ziel zu erreichen, eine immerwährende Kriegführung. Zudem hatte sich diese Ausgangslage nach dem Entstehen eines rivalisierenden Ost- und Westblocks und dem Aufkommen Ostasiens ohnehin ergeben. Die Hauptwirkung des Krieges ist demnach heute die Zerstörung, nicht notwendigerweise von Menschenleben, sondern von Erzeugnissen menschlicher Arbeit. Der Krieg ist ein Mittel, um Materialien, die sonst dazu benützt werden könnten, die Massen zu bequem und damit auf lange Sicht zu intelligent zu machen, in Stücke zu sprengen, in die Stratosphäre zu verpulvern oder in die Tiefe des Meeres zu versenken. Sogar wenn nicht wirklich Kriegswaffen zerstört werden, so ist ihre Fabrikation doch ein bequemer Weg, Arbeitskraft zu verbrauchen, ohne etwas zu erzeugen, was konsumiert werden kann. In einer Schwimmenden Festung zum Beispiel steckte eine Arbeitsleistung, mit der man mehrere hundert Frachtschiffe bauen könnte. Am Schluß wird sie als überholt abgewrackt, ohne jemals jemandem wirklichen Nutzen gebracht zu haben, und mit einem weiteren riesigen Arbeitsaufwand wird eine neue Schwimmende Festung gebaut. Im Prinzip dienen die Kriegsanstrengungen dazu, jeden Überschuß, der vielleicht nach Befriedigung der unerläßlichen Bedürfnisse der Bevölkerung verbleiben könnte, aufzuzehren. In der Praxis werden die Bedürfnisse der Bevölkerung immer unterschätzt, mit dem Ergebnis, daß eine chronische Verknappung der Hälfte aller lebenswichtigen Güter herrscht; aber das wird als Vorteil angesehen. Es ist gewollte Politik, sogar die privilegierten Gruppen am Rande der Not zu halten, denn ein allgemeiner Verknappungszustand hebt die Bedeutung von kleinen Privilegien hervor und vergrößert so den Unterschied zwischen einer Gruppe und einer anderen.“ (Georg Odergut, „Anno 1984. Ein Schelmenroman“)",
