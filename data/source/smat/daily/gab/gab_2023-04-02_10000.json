En 1981, après des études à HEC, Eric devient spécialiste de l'optimisation fiscale notamment pour Elton John.En 1990 élu au conseil municipal de Chantilly, son élection est annulée par le conseil détat pour incompatibilité avec sa fonction de directeur général de l’ADO.L'ADO est une association financée par le conseil général pour gérer des subventions, dont Woerth est le directeur grassement payé.A partir de 1993 il devient directeur financier et administratif du RPR.Il est élu maire de Chantilly en 1995 puis député en 2002.En 2007 il est chargé de l'association pour financer la campagne de Sarkozy.Dans le même temps, sa femme devient directrice des investissements de Clymène, holding financière de la milliardaire Liliane Bettencourt. En 2012 Woerth sera mis en examen pour trafic d'influence passif et recel de financement illicite de parti politique dans l'affaire Affaire Bettencourt. Il sera relaxé en 2015 au motif qu’il n’avait connaissance «de la particulière vulnérabilité de Liliane Bettencourt»En 2018, nouvelle mise en examen pour « complicité de financement illégal de campagne électorale ».

I was looking to rent a basic, cheap, efficiency apartment, but my friend Eric found something better. There was a 3 bedroom ranch for $750 a month that was located about a half mile away from the T.G.I. Friday's I was working at. It was easily affordable for the 2 of us to split the rent, and way nicer than any of the apartments I looked at. One of the most fun features of the property was the \"shed.\" You're all probably familiar with the large shipping containers that come in off the big cargo ships. Well the owner/landlord had one of those secured onto a bed of concrete, and ran wires from the house to the shed, so it had electricity (there were 3 electric outlets in there). Since I was a self-taught drummer and Eric played guitar, our first thought was that this would be perfect for jamming. Of course, because the walls were so thin, sound would carry, and we'd be disturbing the neighbors every time we played. However, the advantage of working at a restaurant was that I could take as many of the egg flats as I wanted (Friday's got in cases of eggs, separated by them so they wouldn't break during shipping). It took me a few months to acquire enough of them layer them all over the walls and ceiling so they were thick enough to dampen the noise. By the time we did that and laid down all the carpeting, the sound of our playing was muffled enough that it could only be heard if you were standing in the back yard. My fellow line cook and friend Larry played bass guitar and could sing a little bit, so now we had a garage band which we aptly named \"Electric Shed.\" We weren't very good, but we could play loud and have fun. Just for kicks, we entered a local \"Battle Of The Bands\" contest in the summer of '88. We lost badly in the first round, and that was that for public appearances. 😂 However, we had some epic parties and lots of great times until time marched on, and so did we. These happy memories made me think of this happy little tune today. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsf7m_DETxE",

When Bragg appointed Colangelo in December, CNN simply reported he was \"a senior official in the US Justice Department and before that served as an attorney on the Trump Foundation investigation with the New York attorney general’s office.\" But CNN failed to report Colangelo is a lifelong leftwing activist (including NAACP lawyer for 7 years) and senior Democrat political appointee for nearly 15 years:<br /><br />- currently appointed to made-up position in Soros-backed Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg's office (to get Trump; first indictment ever of a former president; bogus, trumped-up charges previously declined by prior Manhattan DA, US Attorney, FEC, and Bragg himself)<br /><br />- acting #3 in Biden Justice Department (then as #2 to radical #3 Vanita Gupta, when Biden and Garland appointed her; leader in politicizing and weaponizing Biden DOJ, including prosecuting Christians praying outside of abortion clinics while giving amnesty to abortion-industry activists terrorizing Catholic Churches, crisis-pregnancy centers, and Supreme Court justices and families in homes)<br /><br />- senior lawyer for disgraced Democrat New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (including his Executive Deputy Attorney General for Social Justice) (to get Trump) (Bragg served as chief deputy attorney general when Colangelo brought dozens of lawsuits against Trump administration and led investigations into Trump Foundation and Trump's finances) <br />- senior White House economic advisor to President Obama<br />- top aide to Obama Labor Secretary (and future DNC chair) Tom Perez<br />- top lawyer to Obama DOJ Civil Rights Division head Tom Perez<br />Colangelo has never served as a line  prosecutor or defense attorney. <br />He is simply a senior Democrat operative, brought in by Bragg to get Trump.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://cnn.com/2022/12/05/politics/matthew-colangelo-manhattan-white-collar-investigations/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>cnn.com/2022/12/05/politics/matthew-colangelo<span class=\"invisible\">-manhattan-white-collar-investigations/index.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) investigated the resumes of recent hires and found that more than 360 current employees of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook/Meta are former DOJ employees. Likewise, more than 40 DOJ employees, many of them in senior roles, previously worked at Big Tech firms.According to the report, since President Joe Biden took office, Google hired 40 former DOJ staffers, Amazon hired 61, Microsoft hired 26, and Meta hired 53.While staff often move between government and the private sector, “this case is different because unlike government and industry moving expertise back and forth (knowledge about procurement rules for example) what we have seen moving back and forth between DOJ and tech is a shared political agenda, specifically to silence conservative voices,” Yitz Friedman, AAF communications manager, told The Epoch Times.“Sadly, it is evidence that in the Big Tech community, corporate policy is the government’s policy.”This concern is heightened by recent evidence of collaboration between the DOJ and Twitter to silence Americans, particularly regarding political speech.After buying social media platform Twitter, Elon Musk released thousands of internal emails that allegedly showed collusion between Twitter and DOJ officials to censor speech, including banning a report by the New York Post before the 2020 election that reportedly incriminated then-candidate Joe Biden in illicit payments scandals.‘Campaign of Public Threats’The release of the “Twitter files” follows a lawsuit by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and former Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt that alleges illegal collusion between the Biden administration and Big Tech companies to suppress free speech.In a November 2022 interview with The Epoch Times, Landry stated that, because of the First Amendment, “the government doesn’t have the ability to censor speech, especially political speech. And so they can’t go out there and force these companies [to do it].”Plaintiffs in this case filed a 364-page “finding of fact” document showing a “campaign of public threats against social-media platforms to pressure them to censor more speech on social media.” This document will be discussed in a congressional hearing on March 30 on the “Weaponization of the Federal Government.”https://www.zerohedge.com/political/investigation-reveals-revolving-door-doj-big-tech-employees",

Some cities, including Los Angeles (LA), received multiple grants.Smart city development typically focuses on the implementation of technologies like the IoT, 5G, cloud and edge computing, and biometric surveillance to track, manage, control and extract profit from an array of urban processes.Whitney Webb, an investigative journalist and smart cities critic, said the smart city infrastructure is meant to facilitate the development of cities “micromanaged by technocrats via an all-encompassing system of mass surveillance and a vast array of ‘internet of things’ devices that provide a constant and massive stream of data that is analyzed by artificial intelligence (AI).”‘Concept of a sensor in every home doesn’t look as shiny as it once did’Smart city projects began gaining traction in the U.S. in 2015, boosted by a program launched by then-DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx. Foxx, who went on to become the chief policy officer for Lyft, now works at Tulco, a data science venture capital firm. Foxx created the “Smart City Challenge,” which offered a $50 million grant to the mid-sized city with the best proposal to remake their city as a “smart city.”Vulcan LLC, an investment and philanthropic organization dedicated to materializing the vision of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and whose profit-making services focus on real estate development, partly funded the federal grant.Columbus, Ohio, beat out 77 other cities with its “revolutionary” proposal, but the project was by most accounts a failure — expensive trip-planning kiosks erected downtown were never used, autonomous shuttles had accidents, the public transportation platform was rarely downloaded and sensor-connected trucks failed to materialize.Then, in May 2020, another paradigmatic smart city model project failed when Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs scrapped plans to build a smart city prototype in Toronto amid public outcry about surveillance and profiteering.According to The Globe and Mail, Eric Schmidt, former head of Google parent company Alphabet, described the project in these terms:“The genesis of the thinking for Sidewalk Labs came from Google’s founders getting excited thinking of ‘all the things you could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge.’”https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/smart-cities-surveillance-tech/",

Some cities, including Los Angeles (LA), received multiple grants.Smart city development typically focuses on the implementation of technologies like the IoT, 5G, cloud and edge computing, and biometric surveillance to track, manage, control and extract profit from an array of urban processes.Whitney Webb, an investigative journalist and smart cities critic, said the smart city infrastructure is meant to facilitate the development of cities “micromanaged by technocrats via an all-encompassing system of mass surveillance and a vast array of ‘internet of things’ devices that provide a constant and massive stream of data that is analyzed by artificial intelligence (AI).”‘Concept of a sensor in every home doesn’t look as shiny as it once did’Smart city projects began gaining traction in the U.S. in 2015, boosted by a program launched by then-DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx.

Problem was only 40 people showed up for their protests!  And by the time they showed up there,  they were outnumbered by counter protesters.

And in the other corner is the challenger  Joe \"Meatball\" Tacopina who learned how to talk from watching Humphrey Bogart movies.  Joe Tacopina got his education at Skidmore College in Brooklyn, NY,  then onto law school at the very small Bridge Port Law school,  and did not guaduate with any honors.

Like an article I read from Playboy magazine once talking about how a new guy sits down that the Texas Hold 'Em card table in Las Vegas,  and if he can't figure out who is the worst player at the table,  the sucker is him.30 separate criminal indictments from a grand jury in NYC means only one thing;  Trump's goose is cooked,  stick a fork in him, he is done.Expect more indictments to follow;  from Fulton County Georgia,  and the US Justice Dept.  That grand jury in Washington DC is wrapping up their show now with Mike Pence and Mark Meadows being some the very few left to testify under oath there.That lawyer who is running that case is a Trump lawyer's worst nightmare;  Jack Smith.

That guy should really terrify Trump now more that Alvin Bragg.  Remember his name;  Jack Smith.  Somebody I would want on my ass ever.From a humorous side note;  comedian Desi Lydic brutally mocks MAGA clowns by putting together a parody of Trumpers begging for donations for poor victimized Trump.\"Is there anything more heartbreaking  than the tears of a conservative?  Every single hour,  all across America's conservative TV networks, another sad Republican cries about Donald Trump's indictment.\"   \"Every hour another conservative cries on TV about Trump's indictment.

The filing says Manafort gave him polling data related to the 2016 campaign and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan with him. Most of the polling data was reportedly public, although some was private Trump campaign polling data.

Will it depict a meaningful statement?Is this just a ploy to enrich alternative media?Letter/Email below from Ezra Levant - #RebelNews This is personal to me.Throughout history, Righteous Gentiles helped save Jews from terrible harm — including hiding Jews from Nazis during the Holocaust.But now it’s Christians who are being persecuted. Even in Canada.Christian pastors in Canada are being arrested, prosecuted and jailed. First it was for keeping their churches open during the pandemic. Now it’s for peacefully protesting against \"drag queen story hour”.But no-one seems to care.I care. I care because it’s wrong. Canada is supposed to protect freedom of religionBut I also care because I feel within me a debt to Righteous Gentiles who protected Jews throughout the ages.Do I not have a moral obligation to return the favour, to do my part to speak out for Christians who are under attack?Over the years Rebel News has reported on these cases, when the mainstream media either ignored the stories or cheered on the persecution of these Christians. We’ve even crowdfunded lawyers to defend pastors.But it’s getting worse. So I have an idea. It’s a big idea, so I need your help. I want to make a movie-quality documentary movie about the plight of Christians in Canada. Something so polished and professional that it could actually be shown on Netflix or Amazon Prime.But to do that, I need your help.Here, take a look at this video, where I explain my plan:https://youtu.be/BcjnQEPQpZMThis documentary is one of the most important projects we've ever produced.We’ve already got a working title for it: Church Under Fire: Canada's War on Christianity.You know, the whole world thinks of Canada as a cold but friendly place where nothing much ever happens. We’ve got to wake up the world to what’s happening to Canadian Christians — not just to get help for them but to send a warning of what could happen in other countries, too.We want to pull out all the stops to make this documentary and share it with the world. It’s got to be beautifully produced and edited, and properly marketed.But that costs money, and we’re just a small operation. We need to raise $100,000 to cover production costs, equipment, salaries for the crew and other expenses. $100,000 sounds like a lot. But many hands make light work — we’re going to crowdfund it.And that’s why I’m writing to you today: can you please help chip in a few dollars?And if you help us, we’ll give you some great perks, too, ranging from limited-edition t-shirts, to a special sneak-preview viewing, to having your name on screen in the credits as an executive producer!Those perks are just for fun: the main thing is that we raise the funds to make this movie.

Smith将軍の事務所の関係者はReal Raw Newsに語った。彼によると、将軍の事務所は米陸軍サイバー軍（ARCYBER、）を通じて、マンハッタン検事局裁判部長のリサ・デルピッツォ（Lisa DelPizzo）からアルビン・ブラッグに送られたメールを入手し、そこには、火曜日の午後、事務所がトランプ大統領から頬の綿棒、血液、「少なくとも100本の毛髪サンプル」を採取するかどうかを尋ねているという。また、シークレットサービスがDNA採取を阻止しようとするかどうかについてのブラッグの考えも聞いています。ARCYBERの情報筋によると、返信を傍受しなかったが、DelPizzoのメールをスミス将軍に転送した。ブラッグが架空とはいえ、追加の罪でトランプを陥れるかもしれないという予兆のように思えたからだ。殺人事件や性的暴行事件では、法執行機関は日常的に容疑者を口移しして毛根を採取している。ほとんどの場合、容疑者（あるいは目撃者）は自発的にDNAを提出するよう求められるが、拒否すれば必然的に警察が敵対し、必要であれば力ずくで協力を強制する令状が出る。具体的な飲酒運転の捜査では、警察は酩酊物質の有無を調べるために採血の令状を取ることができます。しかし、金融犯罪で起訴された人のDNA証拠収集を義務付ける判例はないと、憲法学財団のビル・カレン弁護士はリアル・ロー・ニュースに語った。「大統領を起訴する判例がないだけでなく、金融犯罪の容疑者から綿棒や毛根を採取する判例も、私の知る限りではありません。もちろん、警察が尋ねることはできるが、誰も自発的に話したり助けたりすることはないはずだ。アルビン・ブラッグの起訴状はまだ封印されているが、これは疑わしいと思うし、トランプに対する告発が偽りであったとしても驚かない」とカレン氏は言う。スミス将軍の関係者は、ブラッグがトランプのDNAを欲しがる理由をこう推測している。\"ディープステート \"であるブラッグが、拘束しているトランプがクローンやドッペルゲンガー、ボディダブルではなく、本物のドナルド・トランプであることを確認したい、という可能性はなくはないでしょう。DNAがクローンを除外することはできないが、ダブルを検出することはできるだろう」と述べた。\"あるいは、もちろん、彼がそこに入ったら、何か別のことで彼をハメようとするかもしれない\"。本物のトランプ大統領はNORADやAREA51に隠されていて、ドッペルゲンガーがマー・ア・ラゴに住み、集会で公の場に姿を現しているという説について、私たちは情報筋にコメントを求めた。「もしそれが本当なら、私が言える範囲外だろう」と彼は言った。それにもかかわらず、スミス将軍はデルピッツォのメールをトランプ大統領とその弁護団に転送したと彼は言った。昨日お伝えしたように、スミス将軍はトランプ大統領に、マー・ア・ラゴで待機し、ニューヨークへの出張を避けるよう懇願したが、トランプ大統領はその忠告を聞き入れようとしなかった。彼らは日曜日に再び話す予定であると、我々の情報筋は述べている。",
