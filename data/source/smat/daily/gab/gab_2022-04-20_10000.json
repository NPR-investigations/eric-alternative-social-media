Vance more than just authenticity in the Senate GOP primary. It has also brought more millions into the campaign from billionaire backer Peter Thiel.Thiel, a longtime Trump supporter, has donated $3.5 million to Protect Ohio Values, a super PAC that is backing Vance, a source told Politico Tuesday.Thiel, 54, was the co-founder of PayPal and an early Facebook investor. He had already pumped $10 million into Protect Ohio Values, according to the report.Both primary candidates Mike Gibbons and Josh Mandel are vying for support from Trump's America First voters, and both had more cash than Vance before Trump's endorsement.The Ohio GOP Senate primary is May 3 and Vance had reported just $1.6 million in his war chest at the end of March, according to Politico.Protect Ohio Values reportedly had just $300,000 left in the tank after the initial Thiel donation, battling the Club for Growth PAC that was backing Mandel and reminding MAGA (Make America Great Again) voters Vance was once a vocal public critic of Trump.With the new donations, Protect Ohio Values has booked $1.3 million in ads in Ohio this week, according to AdImpact.Thiel is also backing Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters with a $10 million donation to a super PAC backing him.",

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and others from leveling the preemptive sanctions necessary to prevent (Russian President) Vladimir Putin from running into Ukraine and causing the chaos that we have seen unfold, at that same time was taking money that had the stench of Russian oppression on it, so this is what we can expect.”While Schumer criticized Koch Industries Inc., the company long owned by Charles and the late David Koch. for still doing business with Russia, it became known that the Democrat Senator from New York also takes political contributions, via a PAC, from International Paper, which is also still doing business with Russia.“The ‘rules for thee and not for me’ that has permeated American politics (is) because of career politicians like Chuck Schumer, 42 years in Congress, 24 years in the United States Senate,” Pinion said. “Enough is enough. Because the policies may be offensive, but the outcome is death and despair for the Ukrainians. It is, in many ways the end of democracy as we know it here at home.”Schumer, the incumbent, is facing Democrats Moses Mugulusi and Khaled Salem in the June 28 primary, while Pinion is facing five other GOP opponents for the Republican nomination.Pinion also said that Schumer and the new Democratic New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, are not really for funding the police, and interested in lowering the rising crime rates in the city.“This is the reality here. These are just the facts. These are not opinions. When Chuck Schumer and people like this mayor try to pretend that they are on the side of law enforcement, they are on the side of law and order. All we have are the results that show from the open southern border that we have this large fentanyl supply to flood Main Street USA and bring death to the doorsteps of urban and suburban mothers alike. They do not care about your safety. They did not care about security. They have no respect for law and order in this country that we love.”https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/joe-pinion-schumer-adams-nyc/2022/04/18/id/1066223/※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and others from leveling the preemptive sanctions necessary to prevent (Russian President) Vladimir Putin from running into Ukraine and causing the chaos that we have seen unfold, at that same time was taking money that had the stench of Russian oppression on it, so this is what we can expect.”While Schumer criticized Koch Industries Inc., the company long owned by Charles and the late David Koch. for still doing business with Russia, it became known that the Democrat Senator from New York also takes political contributions, via a PAC, from International Paper, which is also still doing business with Russia.“The ‘rules for thee and not for me’ that has permeated American politics (is) because of career politicians like Chuck Schumer, 42 years in Congress, 24 years in the United States Senate,” Pinion said. “Enough is enough. Because the policies may be offensive, but the outcome is death and despair for the Ukrainians. It is, in many ways the end of democracy as we know it here at home.”Schumer, the incumbent, is facing Democrats Moses Mugulusi and Khaled Salem in the June 28 primary, while Pinion is facing five other GOP opponents for the Republican nomination.Pinion also said that Schumer and the new Democratic New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, are not really for funding the police, and interested in lowering the rising crime rates in the city.“This is the reality here.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and others from leveling the preemptive sanctions necessary to prevent (Russian President) Vladimir Putin from running into Ukraine and causing the chaos that we have seen unfold, at that same time was taking money that had the stench of Russian oppression on it, so this is what we can expect.”While Schumer criticized Koch Industries Inc., the company long owned by Charles and the late David Koch. for still doing business with Russia, it became known that the Democrat Senator from New York also takes political contributions, via a PAC, from International Paper, which is also still doing business with Russia.“The ‘rules for thee and not for me’ that has permeated American politics (is) because of career politicians like Chuck Schumer, 42 years in Congress, 24 years in the United States Senate,” Pinion said. “Enough is enough. Because the policies may be offensive, but the outcome is death and despair for the Ukrainians. It is, in many ways the end of democracy as we know it here at home.”Schumer, the incumbent, is facing Democrats Moses Mugulusi and Khaled Salem in the June 28 primary, while Pinion is facing five other GOP opponents for the Republican nomination.Pinion also said that Schumer and the new Democratic New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, are not really for funding the police, and interested in lowering the rising crime rates in the city.“This is the reality here.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and others from leveling the preemptive sanctions necessary to prevent (Russian President) Vladimir Putin from running into Ukraine and causing the chaos that we have seen unfold, at that same time was taking money that had the stench of Russian oppression on it, so this is what we can expect.”While Schumer criticized Koch Industries Inc., the company long owned by Charles and the late David Koch. for still doing business with Russia, it became known that the Democrat Senator from New York also takes political contributions, via a PAC, from International Paper, which is also still doing business with Russia.“The ‘rules for thee and not for me’ that has permeated American politics (is) because of career politicians like Chuck Schumer, 42 years in Congress, 24 years in the United States Senate,” Pinion said. “Enough is enough. Because the policies may be offensive, but the outcome is death and despair for the Ukrainians. It is, in many ways the end of democracy as we know it here at home.”Schumer, the incumbent, is facing Democrats Moses Mugulusi and Khaled Salem in the June 28 primary, while Pinion is facing five other GOP opponents for the Republican nomination.Pinion also said that Schumer and the new Democratic New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, are not really for funding the police, and interested in lowering the rising crime rates in the city.“This is the reality here. These are just the facts. These are not opinions. When Chuck Schumer and people like this mayor try to pretend that they are on the side of law enforcement, they are on the side of law and order. All we have are the results that show from the open southern border that we have this large fentanyl supply to flood Main Street USA and bring death to the doorsteps of urban and suburban mothers alike. They do not care about your safety. They did not care about security. They have no respect for law and order in this country that we love.”https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/joe-pinion-schumer-adams-nyc/2022/04/18/id/1066223/※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",
