Determined to stop his high-octane lethal feud is Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen.\nPredictably, the inquisition starts in the city‚Äôs police headquarters. There, the veteran cop finds nailing a jelly to the wall far easier than stopping a merc‚Äô on a mission.\nIn the predator‚Äôs cross-hairs are the most sinister but successful sinners of Liverpool‚Äôs underworld. ‚ÄòMess with the best, die like the rest‚Äô appears to be Jack Scarlett‚Äôs maxim as after being crossed in love and trust he evens the score.\nThe killer question is, can Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen stop Jack Scarlett, and does he really want to. That is for you to decide.",

We will remove a post according to our interpretation (written by us) of the guidelines below.

We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God‚Äôs mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.‚Äù Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n\r\n***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING: Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n\r\n***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else's well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? \r\n\r\nWith that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.\r\n\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n\r\n***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n\r\n***‚ÄúThe Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. ‚ÄúSo shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.‚Äù Numbers 6:24-27 ESV\r\n\r\n***Group Creator:  @Micaiah\r\nAdmins/Mods: @Shooglenifty, @riustan",
