It should also be of interest to non-Catholics as well.I posted a piece at http://Gab.com. I will append that comment at the end of this email in case you would like to read it. The topic of the posting covered the concept of malignant obedience, such as prelates, clerics and people dutifully complying with the reckless actions of Pope Francis promoting and enforcing vaccine mandates---and going so far as to demand the resignation of a Puerto Rican bishop (Bp. Torres) for not urging vaccines on the flock, particularly the experimental and, now, clearly known-to-be dangerous mRNA-based injections, supposedly to combat COVID. (I know, it is a Germanically-long sentence.)Eric Sammons, editor of Crisis Magazine, produced a podcast interview of Bp. Strickland of the Tyler, Texas Diocese. Bp. Strickland has been seen in approving terms by Catholics, myself included. You can listen here:A Conversation with Bishop Joseph Strickland (http://crisismagazine.com)Further, I much appreciate the articles and editorial selections that Mr. Sammons provides at Crisis Magazine.(As an aside, I urge you to visit it frequently and--if you can--to subscribe or support that excellent work however you can. I also urge that you visit and join http://Gab.com.)As much as I respect and appreciate the efforts and mission of both of these men, I was extremely disappointed and dismayed by the end of the interview linked above. I am too much of a fighter to give into despondency, otherwise, I could have possibly lost my spirit and failed in my duty to exhibit Christian fortitude..Mr. Sammons asked Bishop Strickland to provide advice to serious, knowledgeable and committedly-faithful Catholics who are profoundly frustrated with the actions of their bishop and the bishops (and priests) in general. That is a good start. The response was disappointing and I do wish Mr. Sammons would have instead pressed for a more helpful response.Essentially, the bishop's advice was to pray for the bishops, draw closer to Jesus, but beyond that---do nothing.The substance of the podcast relevant to this discussion begins to emerge in the podcast around minute 16:30.Certainly we pray for the bishops. This is a most-important and effective initial, and sustained, work we can do. But we also must pray about the bishop---given his role and ours.",

The topic of the posting covered the concept of malignant obedience, such as prelates, clerics and people dutifully complying with the reckless actions of Pope Francis promoting and enforcing vaccine mandates---and going so far as to demand the resignation of a Puerto Rican bishop (Bp. Torres) for not urging vaccines on the flock, particularly the experimental and, now, clearly known-to-be dangerous mRNA-based injections, supposedly to combat COVID.

I also urge that you visit and join http://Gab.com.)As much as I respect and appreciate the efforts and mission of both of these men, I was extremely disappointed and dismayed by the end of the interview linked above. I am too much of a fighter to give into despondency, otherwise, I could have possibly lost my spirit and failed in my duty to exhibit Christian fortitude..Mr. Sammons asked Bishop Strickland to provide advice to serious, knowledgeable and committedly-faithful Catholics who are profoundly frustrated with the actions of their bishop and the bishops (and priests) in general. That is a good start. The response was disappointing and I do wish Mr. Sammons would have instead pressed for a more helpful response.Essentially, the bishop's advice was to pray for the bishops, draw closer to Jesus, but beyond that---do nothing.The substance of the podcast relevant to this discussion begins to emerge in the podcast around minute 16:30.Certainly we pray for the bishops. This is a most-important and effective initial, and sustained, work we can do. But we also must pray about the bishop---given his role and ours.",

It should also be of interest to non-Catholics as well.I posted a piece at http://Gab.com. I will append that comment at the end of this email in case you would like to read it. The topic of the posting covered the concept of malignant obedience, such as prelates, clerics and people dutifully complying with the reckless actions of Pope Francis promoting and enforcing vaccine mandates---and going so far as to demand the resignation of a Puerto Rican bishop (Bp. Torres) for not urging vaccines on the flock, particularly the experimental and, now, clearly known-to-be dangerous mRNA-based injections, supposedly to combat COVID. (I know, it is a Germanically-long sentence.)Eric Sammons, editor of Crisis Magazine, produced a podcast interview of Bp. Strickland of the Tyler, Texas Diocese. Bp. Strickland has been seen in approving terms by Catholics, myself included. You can listen here:A Conversation with Bishop Joseph Strickland (http://crisismagazine.com)Further, I much appreciate the articles and editorial selections that Mr. Sammons provides at Crisis Magazine.(As an aside, I urge you to visit it frequently and--if you can--to subscribe or support that excellent work however you can. I also urge that you visit and join http://Gab.com.)As much as I respect and appreciate the efforts and mission of both of these men, I was extremely disappointed and dismayed by the end of the interview linked above. I am too much of a fighter to give into despondency, otherwise, I could have possibly lost my spirit and failed in my duty to exhibit Christian fortitude..Mr. Sammons asked Bishop Strickland to provide advice to serious, knowledgeable and committedly-faithful Catholics who are profoundly frustrated with the actions of their bishop and the bishops (and priests) in general. That is a good start. The response was disappointing and I do wish Mr. Sammons would have instead pressed for a more helpful response.Essentially, the bishop's advice was to pray for the bishops, draw closer to Jesus, but beyond that---do nothing.The substance of the podcast relevant to this discussion begins to emerge in the podcast around minute 16:30.Certainly we pray for the bishops. This is a most-important and effective initial, and sustained, work we can do. But we also must pray about the bishop---given his role and ours.",

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7.

We will remove a post that doesn&#39;t follow the guidelines below.<\/p><br /><hr><br /><p>My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: &quot;Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT<\/p><br /><hr><br /><p>PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:<br />Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):<\/p><ol><li>Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.<br /><\/li><li>Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don&#39;t respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don&#39;t post it. <br />***<br />It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God&#39;s heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else&#39;s well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:<br /><\/li><li>Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts<br /><\/li><li>Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)<br /><\/li><li>Posts that don&#39;t meet the criteria mentioned above<br /><\/li><li>Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.<br /><\/li><li>Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)<br /><\/li><li>All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.<br />***<br />Remember that we are the body of Christ.

In the store surveillance footage, Marcelin is seen getting out of the wheelchair, exposing the leg, and then sitting back down.'This is a gruesome and barbaric homicide, which resulted in a headless torso being disposed of on a New York City corner, and it takes a serial killer off our streets,' Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez told reporters.'This is just the latest of a list of heinous offenses conducted over a period of lifetime by Ms. Harvey, and we can only hope that she can do no more,' he added.According to the NYPD's investigation, Leyden, an LGBTQ activist who lives in a city shelter, was last seen alive on February 27 as she entered Marcelin's apartment at 50 Pennsylvania Avenue, carrying a 'multi-colored bag with a flower decal' and rolling a shopping cart.Two days later, Marcelin and another woman were spotted leaving the building with the same bag as they headed to a Home Depot in Manhattan to purchase saws, trash bags",

Note: If you ARE a green person, read it anyway. It's enlightening.Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, \"For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine.\" Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity.I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery. $18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery. Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 Mpg = $0.10 per mile. The gasoline powered car costs about $25,000 while the Volt costs $46,000 plus. So the Government wants us to pay twice as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run, and takes three times longer to drive across the country.WAKE UP AMERICA!!!!!!!....copied from John Koth",

Several brave Wisconsin families reached out to Gableman and his committee after they discovered someone had voted for their loved one who resides in a nursing home. This happened all over Wisconsin.Justice Gableman disclosed during the hearing that the nursing homes in the Zuckerberg-funded cities had a 95% to 100% turnout. This is clear voter fraud they discovered.The video that played during the hearing today was heartbreaking.It takes a special kind of evil to abuse disabled seniors.On Wednesday Just the News published more information on the nursing home voter fraud.The special counsel investigating suspected irregularities in Wisconsin’s 2020 election has found that 91 nursing homes in the counties of Milwaukee, Racine, Dane, Kenosha, and Brown had voter turnout rates ranging from 95% to a 100% in 2020 — as compared to overall nationwide participation rates of 67% in 2020 and 60% in 2016.The nursing home data only reflects voting at the facilities that the special counsel “has been able to vet to this juncture,” according to the report compiled by retired state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman for the state Assembly. “There are more facilities in these counties, and after auditing the votes from other facilities, the above percentages may change.”The Mark Zuckerberg-funded Center for Tech and Civic Life gave $8.8 million towards the administration of the 2020 election in Wisconsin.One of Sinkula’s colleagues knew ahead of time “how the outcome was going to come in November,” Sinkula claimed, because the colleague knew people who had registered nursing home residents who didn’t normally vote and apparently voted for them.”Slowly we are learning the full picture on the 2020 election steal.And what we learn from Wisconsin was likely duplicated in state after state.",

In the past, Weinberg has enticed consumers to switch from Google by promising “unbiased results.”Some users, including Tom Fitton, president of the Judicial Watch nonprofit, questioned the CEO’s response right away.“Contrary to its implicit promises to the contrary,” he said on Twitter, DuckDuckGo “is now in the censorship business.” “Are there any search engines that respect users?”“Today, you are removing Russian disinformation Tomorrow you will be removing genuine protests,” another user wrote.A request for comment from DuckDuckGo was not answered.Some of the critics were eventually addressed by Weinberg.“Search engines by definition try to put more relevant content higher and less relevant content lower—that’s not censorship, it’s search ranking relevancy,” he added.Since 2017, Google has ranked Russian official media posts lower in its search results.At the time, Google parent company Alphabet’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, remarked “We don’t want to ban the sites. That’s not how we operate. I am strongly not in favor of censorship. I am very strongly in favor of ranking. It’s what we do.”One of the outlets, Russia Today, pushed back at the time, claiming, “His colleagues admitted three weeks ago that RT did not violate any rules of the platform.”In early March, Google also stopped selling web advertising in Russia.Around the same time, DuckDuckGo’s senior public policy manager, Katie McInnis, informed a congressional subcommittee that the company had terminated its partnership with Yandex, a Russian search engine.“In light of Russia’s assault on democracy and Ukraine, we have paused our relationship with Yandex,” McInnis told the House Committee on Energy & Commerce. “The index was used to provide traditional links, meaning non-news links, in Russia and Turkey.”",

The name of Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf, was anglicized to Frederick Trump, but he died several years before the report.Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich Drumpf was born on March 14th 1869, in Kallstadt, Pfalz, Germany. In the Pacific Northwest, Friedrich ran sleazy and illegal operations, the White Horse Restaurant and Inn, and the New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia. His business interests catered to the \"deprived\", and shared space with opium dens and brothels. There were rumors that authorities were getting ready to crack down on his type of dens of prostitution, drug dealing and ill-repute. They say that Friedrich was always one step ahead of the law. Around May 1901, Friedrich cashed out and headed back to Germany with his money.Reportedly, Friedrich Drumpf returned to Kallstadt, Germany and married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ. In the meanwhile, Friedrich changed his surname to \"Trump\" to hide his past, and shroud his true background. \"Drumpf\" may be a variation of \"Trumpf\". In 1869, Friedrich had an estate worth $500,000 in today’s dollars when he died in Queens on May 30th 1918, at age 49.There were comments that Elizabeth Christ (born 10/10/1880) was really the daughter of Christ Christ and Anna Maria Rathon. Christ Christ was Friedrich's uncle, his father's brother. Friedrich Trump married his first cousin, Elizabeth Christ. Therefore, the Trumps are also a family which is engaged in the bloodline games as well.Donald Trump's great-grandparents, Christian Johannes Trump and Katharina Barbara Kober Trump, \"Kober\" is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname. Some people suggest the name isn't \"Kober\", but \"Kolber\". \"Kolber\" is very often Jewish. We have seen the genealogies being whitewashed this way again and again. Changing one letter is often the best way to do it.Donald Trump's parents were Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. His grandparents were Friedrich Trump and Elizabeth Christ. Donald Trump has five children from three marriages: Donald John Trump Jr., Ivanka Marie Trump, and Eric Frederick Trump with Ivana Marie Trump; Tiffany Ariana Trump with Marla Ann Maples; and Barron Trump with Melania Knauss Trump.The Trump family has the largest number of Jews in the first family.

The name of Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf, was anglicized to Frederick Trump, but he died several years before the report.Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich Drumpf was born on March 14th 1869, in Kallstadt, Pfalz, Germany. In the Pacific Northwest, Friedrich ran sleazy and illegal operations, the White Horse Restaurant and Inn, and the New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia. His business interests catered to the \"deprived\", and shared space with opium dens and brothels. There were rumors that authorities were getting ready to crack down on his type of dens of prostitution, drug dealing and ill-repute. They say that Friedrich was always one step ahead of the law. Around May 1901, Friedrich cashed out and headed back to Germany with his money.Reportedly, Friedrich Drumpf returned to Kallstadt, Germany and married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ. In the meanwhile, Friedrich changed his surname to \"Trump\" to hide his past, and shroud his true background. \"Drumpf\" may be a variation of \"Trumpf\". In 1869, Friedrich had an estate worth $500,000 in today’s dollars when he died in Queens on May 30th 1918, at age 49.There were comments that Elizabeth Christ (born 10/10/1880) was really the daughter of Christ Christ and Anna Maria Rathon. Christ Christ was Friedrich's uncle, his father's brother. Friedrich Trump married his first cousin, Elizabeth Christ. Therefore, the Trumps are also a family which is engaged in the bloodline games as well.Donald Trump's great-grandparents, Christian Johannes Trump and Katharina Barbara Kober Trump, \"Kober\" is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname. Some people suggest the name isn't \"Kober\", but \"Kolber\". \"Kolber\" is very often Jewish. We have seen the genealogies being whitewashed this way again and again. Changing one letter is often the best way to do it.Donald Trump's parents were Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. His grandparents were Friedrich Trump and Elizabeth Christ. Donald Trump has five children from three marriages: Donald John Trump Jr., Ivanka Marie Trump, and Eric Frederick Trump with Ivana Marie Trump; Tiffany Ariana Trump with Marla Ann Maples; and Barron Trump with Melania Knauss Trump.The Trump family has the largest number of Jews in the first family. All three married children of Donald Trump being married to Jews. That is no mere coincidence, it's a cohencidence. Four Generations of the Trumps beginning from Friedrich Trump (or Drumpf) have had close business and personal associations with Jews.",

            "description": "This group is based on \"Historical Revisionism\" so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal.

Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here. We can never have too many backup groups. The Only requirement is that it must be based on National Socialism and Historical Revisionism.                                                                                                                                                                                                  https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/feed?referrer=Foghornreturns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brother Groups List                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           These are groups that are similar to this NS group but they are not the same.

            "description_html": "<p>This group is based on &quot;Historical Revisionism&quot; so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. <a href=\"http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.t<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">witter2<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>) No infighting or better yet provoking it.

No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal.

The name of Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf, was anglicized to Frederick Trump, but he died several years before the report.Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich Drumpf was born on March 14th 1869, in Kallstadt, Pfalz, Germany. In the Pacific Northwest, Friedrich ran sleazy and illegal operations, the White Horse Restaurant and Inn, and the New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia. His business interests catered to the \"deprived\", and shared space with opium dens and brothels. There were rumors that authorities were getting ready to crack down on his type of dens of prostitution, drug dealing and ill-repute. They say that Friedrich was always one step ahead of the law. Around May 1901, Friedrich cashed out and headed back to Germany with his money.Reportedly, Friedrich Drumpf returned to Kallstadt, Germany and married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ. In the meanwhile, Friedrich changed his surname to \"Trump\" to hide his past, and shroud his true background. \"Drumpf\" may be a variation of \"Trumpf\". In 1869, Friedrich had an estate worth $500,000 in today’s dollars when he died in Queens on May 30th 1918, at age 49.There were comments that Elizabeth Christ (born 10/10/1880) was really the daughter of Christ Christ and Anna Maria Rathon. Christ Christ was Friedrich's uncle, his father's brother. Friedrich Trump married his first cousin, Elizabeth Christ. Therefore, the Trumps are also a family which is engaged in the bloodline games as well.Donald Trump's great-grandparents, Christian Johannes Trump and Katharina Barbara Kober Trump, \"Kober\" is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname. Some people suggest the name isn't \"Kober\", but \"Kolber\". \"Kolber\" is very often Jewish. We have seen the genealogies being whitewashed this way again and again. Changing one letter is often the best way to do it.Donald Trump's parents were Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. His grandparents were Friedrich Trump and Elizabeth Christ. Donald Trump has five children from three marriages: Donald John Trump Jr., Ivanka Marie Trump, and Eric Frederick Trump with Ivana Marie Trump; Tiffany Ariana Trump with Marla Ann Maples; and Barron Trump with Melania Knauss Trump.The Trump family has the largest number of Jews in the first family. All three married children of Donald Trump being married to Jews. That is no mere coincidence, it's a cohencidence.

The name of Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf, was anglicized to Frederick Trump, but he died several years before the report.Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich Drumpf was born on March 14th 1869, in Kallstadt, Pfalz, Germany. In the Pacific Northwest, Friedrich ran sleazy and illegal operations, the White Horse Restaurant and Inn, and the New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia. His business interests catered to the \"deprived\", and shared space with opium dens and brothels. There were rumors that authorities were getting ready to crack down on his type of dens of prostitution, drug dealing and ill-repute. They say that Friedrich was always one step ahead of the law. Around May 1901, Friedrich cashed out and headed back to Germany with his money.Reportedly, Friedrich Drumpf returned to Kallstadt, Germany and married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ. In the meanwhile, Friedrich changed his surname to \"Trump\" to hide his past, and shroud his true background. \"Drumpf\" may be a variation of \"Trumpf\". In 1869, Friedrich had an estate worth $500,000 in today’s dollars when he died in Queens on May 30th 1918, at age 49.There were comments that Elizabeth Christ (born 10/10/1880) was really the daughter of Christ Christ and Anna Maria Rathon. Christ Christ was Friedrich's uncle, his father's brother. Friedrich Trump married his first cousin, Elizabeth Christ. Therefore, the Trumps are also a family which is engaged in the bloodline games as well.Donald Trump's great-grandparents, Christian Johannes Trump and Katharina Barbara Kober Trump, \"Kober\" is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname. Some people suggest the name isn't \"Kober\", but \"Kolber\". \"Kolber\" is very often Jewish. We have seen the genealogies being whitewashed this way again and again. Changing one letter is often the best way to do it.Donald Trump's parents were Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. His grandparents were Friedrich Trump and Elizabeth Christ. Donald Trump has five children from three marriages: Donald John Trump Jr., Ivanka Marie Trump, and Eric Frederick Trump with Ivana Marie Trump; Tiffany Ariana Trump with Marla Ann Maples; and Barron Trump with Melania Knauss Trump.The Trump family has the largest number of Jews in the first family. All three married children of Donald Trump being married to Jews. That is no mere coincidence, it's a cohencidence.

The man is an utter danger. I believe that he is a spiritual danger. But, here, as a medical scientist, I want to focus on what is closer to my competency as a layman. There has been every opportunity for these Princes of the Church, and their clergy and other Church officials to become better informed about the true nature of the COVID situation. Certainly, there has been the voices of scientists and physicians sounding an alarm regarding the inadvisability of the world-wide, economic lockdown, social distancing, mask wearing and, most insidious of all, the promotion and mandating of shoddily-developed, untested, pseudovaccines based on mRNA and DNA-viral vector spike proteins. But if these credible experts, heavily censored and threatened, are insufficient to Churchmen, then surely the voice of Archbishop Viganò should have caught their attention. Infact, As Papal Nuncio to the United States, the Archbishop was--as Bp. Strickland points out in his own case--the official who called them to request that they consider accepting their role as bishop. There are many ways to access the commentary by Abp. Viganó in documents and videos.

It means listening to reliable voices precisely when it will take courage.<br /><br />We must begin to teach both the laity and the prelates that there is a difference between positional, bureaucratic power and the due authority of (1) adherence to the verities of the Church's teaching since antiquity and (2) the type of intellectual authority that can withstand professional, public and properly exercised forensic scrutiny.<br /><br />Following the powers of the present-day oligarchs, the churchmen have failed to defend their flock, and they have resorted to unjustified deference to their church and public authorities. the latter are not immune to massive corruption.

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this.

Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how.

With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6.
