People are rightly repulsed by religion and the practices of religious people. Religion is the devil‚Äôs favorite tool and to the extent that something called Chriatianity looks and acts like a religion it is just as bad as all the other religions. True Biblical Christianity is not a religion. It is a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ based on grace not works.

Additionally, Greene has already called to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his poor border management.In November 2021, then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) pledged to put the two back on committees if Republicans won control of the House in the midterm elections, which they did.Shortly thereafter, in January 2022, McCarthy told Breitbart News‚Äôs Matthew Boyle, which he confirmed last week when speaking to reporters ‚Äî that he would strip Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) of their respective committee seats in the 118th Congress.McCarthy indicated this would be due to Schiff using his role as the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee to perpetrate the Russia hoax, Swalwell for having a long-running affair with a woman the intelligence community identified as a Chinese spy named Fang Fang, and Omar for making numerous antisemitic comments and downplaying the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ) received committee assignments in the new Republican-controlled House after being kicked off committees by the Democrats in 2021.<br /><br />On Tuesday, the 30-member House Republican Steering Committee, consisting of House Leadership and elected regional representatives, selected Greene to sit on the Homeland Security Committee and Oversight Committees, in addition to Gosar being chosen to sit on the House Natural Resources and Oversight Committees, according to multiple reports.<br /><br />The Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. James Comer (R-KY), and the Homeland Security Committee, chaired by Rep. Mark Green (R-TN), are expected to hold multiple investigations. Additionally, Greene has already called to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his poor border management.<br /><br />In November 2021, then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) pledged to put the two back on committees if Republicans won control of the House in the midterm elections, which they did.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, in January 2022, McCarthy told Breitbart News‚Äôs Matthew Boyle, which he confirmed last week when speaking to reporters ‚Äî that he would strip Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) of their respective committee seats in the 118th Congress.<br /><br />McCarthy indicated this would be due to Schiff using his role as the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee to perpetrate the Russia hoax, Swalwell for having a long-running affair with a woman the intelligence community identified as a Chinese spy named Fang Fang, and Omar for making numerous antisemitic comments and downplaying the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.",

To guard against a wave of black migrants cashing in, AARAC took a stab at incorporating time-in-residency prerequisites.<br /><br />Their fiscal border wall, however, has big gaps.&nbsp;Their list of criteria applies a ‚Äúmust meet at least two‚Äù approach, making it easier for new San Franciscans to sidestep the length-of-residency rules. For example, if you‚Äôre a descendant of a slave, and you were personally or a direct descendant of someone incarcerated for breaking drug laws, you‚Äôre in.<br /><br />In a blow to the woke pillar of creative and flexible identity,&nbsp;AARAC shamefully stipulates that all applicants should have ‚Äúidentified‚Äù as ‚Äúblack/African American‚Äù for at least 10 years. Let‚Äôs just hope there‚Äôs no need for photo ID.<br /><br />Financial acumen appears to be in short supply among the AARAC members.&nbsp;San Francisco‚Äôs budget is around $14 billion&nbsp;and there were about&nbsp;47,000&nbsp;African Americans in the 2020 census.
