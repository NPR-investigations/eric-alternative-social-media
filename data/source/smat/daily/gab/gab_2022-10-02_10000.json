ERIC, which stands for Electronic Registration Information Center, ERIC ‚Äì the Epicenter of Voter Fraud - American Policy Center is a membership organization for states that ostensibly helps them clean up their voter rolls. George Soros provided its seed money in 2012, funneled through the Pew Charitable Trust. Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia are ERIC members, which means that private organization has access to personal information about most residents past and present.<br /><br />Louisiana recently withdrew its membership because of ‚Äúquestionable funding sources‚Äù and because ‚Äúpartisan actors may have access to ERIC network data for political purposes,‚Äù according to the secretary of state. Citizen activists made that victory a reality, and their cohorts in Wisconsin and Michigan are fighting back as well. Other states such as Pennsylvania are playing into the plot.<br /><br />Election Fraud Update: Pennsylvania Steps Up the Steal - American Policy Center: <a href=\"https://americanpolicy.org/2022/08/30/election-fraud-update-pennsylvania-steps-up-the-steal/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>americanpolicy.org/2022/08/30/election-fraud-<span class=\"invisible\">update-pennsylvania-steps-up-the-steal/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Kat explains what ERIC is and how it works behind the scenes to undermine voter registrations. She also reveals what can be done to stop the steal.<br /><br />Original ERIC members: Colorado, Delaware, Missouri, Nevada, Utah, Washington and Virginia.<br /><br />Current ERIC Members: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Washington DC, West Virginia, Wisconsin.<br /><br />**All ERIC members have \"bloated voter rolls approaching or exceeding 100% of all possible eligible voters in the state,\" according to Stansell.<br /><br />States that are not members: Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wyoming<br /><br />For more great content, visit <a href=\"http://www.TheNewAmerican.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>TheNewAmerican.com<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you‚Äôll want to be sure you‚Äôre posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language will be removed.

Jasper told Alex Newman for this special episode of Behind The Deep State. Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nationalists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to ‚Äúkidnap‚Äù Michigan Gov. Whitmer. Jasper sug-gests that understanding these facts is foundational to understanding how the Deep State works and what may be coming.<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-getting-bolder/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-ge<span class=\"invisible\">tting-bolder/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Bilderberg member POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE - I was the CIA director.

Jasper told Alex Newman for this special episode of Behind The Deep State. Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nation-alists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to ‚Äúkidnap‚Äù Michigan Gov. Whitmer. Jasper sug-gests that understanding these facts is foundational to understanding how the Deep State works and what may be coming.https://thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-getting-bolder/Bilderberg member POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE - I was the CIA director.

Jasper told Alex Newman for this special episode of Behind The Deep State. Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nation-alists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to ‚Äúkidnap‚Äù Michigan Gov. Whitmer. Jasper sug-gests that understanding these facts is foundational to understanding how the Deep State works and what may be coming.<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-getting-bolder/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-ge<span class=\"invisible\">tting-bolder/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Bilderberg member POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE - I was the CIA director.

This guy worked as a senior adviser to Condoleezza Rice and Hilary Clinton during their stints at the State Department. He played a big part in overseeing the old neocon \"spreading freedom and democracy\" thing. Google hired him to lead their \"think tank\" Google Ideas. Armed with Washington connections and the backing of a Silicon Valley monolith, nothing but bad things come to mind. Here is an excerpt from a news article that cites documents from the Manning leaks to give you an idea of how big of a deal this is.<br /><br />\"In turn, Burton replied, ‚ÄúCohen‚Äôs rabbi is Eric Schmidt and Obama lackey. My source is trying to find out if the billionaire owners are backing Cohen‚Äôs efforts for regime change.‚Äù (doc-id 1111729)\"<br /><br />\"Later on, Burton forwarded information from the ‚ÄúGoogle source‚Äù of Cohen‚Äôs links in establishing <a href=\"http://Movements.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>Movements.org<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>. The source added, ‚ÄúA site created to help online organization of groups and individuals to move democracy in stubborn nations. Funded through public-private partnerships.‚Äù Burton pointed out that the US State Department is the organization‚Äôs public sponsor.‚Äù (doc-id 1118344)\"<br /><br />\"Indeed, the State Department, partnering with a number of corporations, was the main sponsor for the 2008 inaugural Alliance of Youth Movements summit in New York City that subsequently established <a href=\"http://Movements.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>Movements.org<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>. Hillary Clinton endorsed the organization and presented a video message during the second summit held in Mexico City a year later.\"<br /><br />\"On 11 February, Burton wrote to the secure email list that Cohen was still planning to head to Gaza. He added, ‚ÄúThe dude is a loose can[n]on. GOOGLE is trying to stop his entry into Gaza now because the dude is like scorched earth. It‚Äôs unclear to GOOGLE if he‚Äôs driving without a license, but GOOGLE believes he‚Äôs on a specific mission of ‚Äúregime change‚Äù on the part of leftist fools inside the WH who are using him for their agendas.‚Äù (doc-id 1113596)\"<br /><a href=\"https://archive.ph/3HH7p\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>archive.ph/3HH7p<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

          "content": "\"The pro-Kremlin crowd in online Dissident Right spaces has one argument that they love above all others. Mike Peinovich made it in his recent post (https://t.me/mpeinovich/2011) about how utterly right he is (in his view) to support Russia over Ukraine. Greg Johnson from Counter-Currents offered to debate him on that point (https://t.me/countercurrents/3233), an offer which Joel Davis (https://t.me/joeldavisx/989) and Mark Collett (https://t.me/markacollett/6163) both seconded, an offer which Mike and TRS will no doubt refuse. As we speak that same argument the pro-Kremlin crowd is being repeated again and again in Joel Davis' chat where Greg Johnson is replying to the Joel Davis post in support of the debate. The argument is this: NATO will make your country gay, non-White, and infested with drag queen story hour. NATO is homosexual imperialism, NATO will corrupt your youth, NATO will subvert your immigration policies, NATO will sponsor drag queen story hour in your cities, NATO will subvert your national identity et cetera ad nauseum to the enth degree. It unironically gets so tiring so hear them drag that argument out, and it's without a doubt their favourite argument. Like most of their arguments, it's an emotional one, not a logical one, and it's easily refuted. I am Estonian, members of my family were murdered by Russians over the years. Children who were executed by Jewish-Russian Communist death squads because they were related to men who dared to take up arms in defense of Estonia, in defense of Europe, against the USSR. I am emotionally invested in this conflict. However, I know that many aren't, and my arguments by and large rely on logic and reason. I can't say to an American who listens to too much TRS that he should support Ukraine and oppose Russia because I have family members who were killed by Russians. That's not going to get through to him and it's an emotional argument that can be easily brushed away. That's how I see this pro-Kremlin argument, it's just emotional, and allow me to show why it's such a bad argument. All we need to do to prove the whole \"NATO will turn your country brown and gay\" is nonsense is to compare two countries: Poland vs Ireland.Ireland has never been a NATO member. Poland has been a NATO member for over 23 years. There is an entire generation of Poles who have never known a non-NATO Poland. And what are these Polish youth like?The most popular party among Poles aged 18-24 is Konfederacja, a strongly Nationalist, Traditionalist, and socially Conservative party. (https://t.me/hotptakes/3201) This is something the pro-Kremlin crowd has to be aware of, since Joel Davis has posted about it (https://t.me/joeldavisx/846). As an side you might notice I mention Joel Davis and his chat a lot in my channel. Two reasons for that. 1. I debated with Kremlin supporters in there a lot 2. Of all the Anglosphere commentators he has been the most reasonable when it comes to Ukraine and Russia. While I still disagree with his conclusions on just about everything when it comes to these topics, he has been reasonable and not resorted to the Eric Striker, Dharmaking, Zoltaneous, or Mark Collett level of Kremlin bootlicking and propaganda regurgitation. I could write a lot about Poland, but we all know the basics. Poland is a 99% White country where traditional family values and patriotic national feelings are still in the vast majority of the country, even among the youth who have never known a non-NATO Poland. In just 18 months Poland will have been a NATO member for 25 years, a quarter of a century. Still White, still traditional. When confronted with this the pro-Kremlin crowd always resort to \"just wait, Poland is just a new member, this country will be black, brown, and gay before you know it.\" However, 25 years is a very long time for a country to change. Just think about various 25 year periods in American society. Look at America in 1950 vs America in 1975. Or from 1975 to 2000. Or from 2000 to America on the brink of 2023. A lot of change can clearly happen in a quarter of a century, and yet Polish youth are supporting a very \"far right\" party. Now lets compare Poland to Ireland.\" - https://t.me/JamesArants",
          "contentraw": "\"The pro-Kremlin crowd in online Dissident Right spaces has one argument that they love above all others. Mike Peinovich made it in his recent post (<a href=\"https://t.me/mpeinovich/2011\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>t.me/mpeinovich/2011<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>) about how utterly right he is (in his view) to support Russia over Ukraine. Greg Johnson from Counter-Currents offered to debate him on that point (<a href=\"https://t.me/countercurrents/3233\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>t.me/countercurrents/3233<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>), an offer which Joel Davis (<a href=\"https://t.me/joeldavisx/989\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>t.me/joeldavisx/989<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>) and Mark Collett (<a href=\"https://t.me/markacollett/6163\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>t.me/markacollett/6163<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>) both seconded, an offer which Mike and TRS will no doubt refuse. <br /><br />As we speak that same argument the pro-Kremlin crowd is being repeated again and again in Joel Davis' chat where Greg Johnson is replying to the Joel Davis post in support of the debate. The argument is this: <br /><br />NATO will make your country gay, non-White, and infested with drag queen story hour. NATO is homosexual imperialism, NATO will corrupt your youth, NATO will subvert your immigration policies, NATO will sponsor drag queen story hour in your cities, NATO will subvert your national identity et cetera ad nauseum to the enth degree. It unironically gets so tiring so hear them drag that argument out, and it's without a doubt their favourite argument. <br /><br />Like most of their arguments, it's an emotional one, not a logical one, and it's easily refuted. I am Estonian, members of my family were murdered by Russians over the years. Children who were executed by Jewish-Russian Communist death squads because they were related to men who dared to take up arms in defense of Estonia, in defense of Europe, against the USSR. I am emotionally invested in this conflict. <br /><br />However, I know that many aren't, and my arguments by and large rely on logic and reason. I can't say to an American who listens to too much TRS that he should support Ukraine and oppose Russia because I have family members who were killed by Russians. That's not going to get through to him and it's an emotional argument that can be easily brushed away. That's how I see this pro-Kremlin argument, it's just emotional, and allow me to show why it's such a bad argument. <br /><br />All we need to do to prove the whole \"NATO will turn your country brown and gay\" is nonsense is to compare two countries: <br /><br />Poland vs Ireland.<br /><br />Ireland has never been a NATO member. Poland has been a NATO member for over 23 years. There is an entire generation of Poles who have never known a non-NATO Poland. And what are these Polish youth like?<br /><br />The most popular party among Poles aged 18-24 is Konfederacja, a strongly Nationalist, Traditionalist, and socially Conservative party.
