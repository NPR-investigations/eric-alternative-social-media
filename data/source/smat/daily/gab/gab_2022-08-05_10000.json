            "description": "- - - WARNING - - - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking.Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until #FakeNewsMedia and gov't education. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs.All of our oceans and lakes do actually survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth, only Earth quakes. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored.Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research.

We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs.All of our oceans and lakes do actually survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth, only Earth quakes. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ?

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

It was unpatriotic,” Hutchinson said. “We were watching the Capitol building get defaced over a lie, and it was something that was really hard in that moment to digest.”In her two hours of testimony, Hutchinson made a series of blockbuster claims incriminating former President Donald Trump, her White House colleagues, and even her direct superiors over their conduct as security at the U.S. Capitol was compromised by a horde of demonstrators. Relying on third-party conversations, Hutchinson claimed the president tried to violently hijack the presidential limousine to drive himself down to the rioters on Jan. 6. The claim was denounced as fabricated hours later. She said the president was aware that White House protesters were well-equipped with deadly weapons and still invited them onto government grounds anyway dismissing security concerns, never mind the fact that only a few face charges. And she said former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone personally warned her not to allow Trump to go to the Capitol or “We’re going to get charged with every crime imaginable.” Never mind Cipollone was not at the White House when Hutchinson claimed, according to multiple witnesses. Former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann also disputed another claim by Hutchinson, saying he wrote a note she took credit for.",
