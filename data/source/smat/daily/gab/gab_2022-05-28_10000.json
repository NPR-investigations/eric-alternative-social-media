We only need to limit the scope of this Hpay, Eric, as long as you give me three steamed buns, I will accompany you for 30 minutes, and the transaction will be completed. Conversely, 10 steamed buns will be replaced with 30 steamed buns in 30 minutes, and Eric and his whole family are full. Wen Kong said that as long as someone gives me 2 catties of mutton, he will sleep with me all night, okay, the deal is done, why can't it be? Currency itself is a transaction of demand, that is, exchange. Have you seen these coins in the digital currency market, does anyone care about where the coins in your hand can be paid? It only cares about you giving it money, and no one cares about this key point.",

He was convicted in February. A former majority leader in the New York Senate, Smith was defeated for re-election in 2014.Smith is the latest associate of U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) headed to jail. Formal investigations of several New York politicians began in 2010 after the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) exposed corruption through stories in the New York Post, New York Times and New York Daily News.The first story, in the New York Post of January 31, 2010, focused on a nonprofit called New Direction Local Development Corporation, which according to its website, was founded by Meeks and Smith.Our review of IRS tax returns, New York state budget records, and other documents suggested that New Direction did little development. Instead, it operated to the benefit of Meeks and Smith. Among other financial irregularities, New Direction raised money for Hurricane Katrina victims who never got the assistance.Prosecution of a sitting members of Congress requires the approval of the Attorney General. Meeks has not been prosecuted presumably because he has political and personal ties to former AG Eric Holder. The new AG, Loretta Lynch, is even more tied into the Queens political machine, and we believe, will similarly protect Meeks.Sentenced at the same time was Vincent Tabone, a former Queens Republican Party official. Smith, Tabone, and other GOP officials conspired to allow Smith, a liberal Democrat, to run for New York City mayor as a Republican in 2013, in return for $25,000. Tabone got 3 1/2 years.",

Ahmad was indicted on ten counts related to a massive mortgage fraud scheme in August 2011. He will be sentenced in the near future. Sentencing guidelines call for 10 to 13 years in prison.Ahmad made a $40,000 payment to Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) in 2007 that the Congressman failed to disclose on his Financial Disclosure Reports for 2007, 2008, and 2009. Meeks subsequently claimed the $40,000 payment was a loan, but there were no note or payments until several years after the payment was made. Meeks' omission is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Commitee.On Wednesday, Meeks made little effort to distance himself from the fraudster, releasing a statement that read, in part: \"My thoughts and prayers are with those who were affected by these crimes, and with Ed and his family.\"According to The Daily News :Brooklyn federal law enforcement officials pursuing that case had tried to push Ahmad to spill information about the embattled congressman, but Ahmad refused, sources said.It is not known if the plea deal requires Ahmad to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Any indictment of a sitting member of Congress would have to be cleared by Attorney General Eric Holder. The current, unwritten Justice Department policy is that no criminal charges may be brought against incumbent members of Congress. Holder failed to bring charges against Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) and former Rep. Alan Mollohan (D-WV), both of whom admitted to concealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in income and assets. Rangel also admitted that he did not pay taxes on rental income from a Dominican Republic beach house.Subpoenas have been reportedly issued in an unrelated investigation into Meeks' steering of millions of taxpayer dollars to nonprofit organizations. Meeks reportedly came under scrutiny by the FBI in 2010 after NLPC exposed his involvement with a nonprofit called New Direction Local Development Corporation that, among other questionable dealings, collected money for Hurricane Katrina victims who never got the funds.",

The Nigerian-born Ogundu was convicted in October on 29 counts, including second-degree grand larceny, forgery in the second degree, and first-degree offering a false instrument for filing.The prosecution was based on information uncovered by the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), and made public through a New York Post article in April 2012. The Ogundu expos√É¬© was a spinoff of our investigation of Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), who secured a $380,500 earmark for the \"clinic.\"After reviewing Meeks' earmarks in 2011, NLPC decided to take a closer look at Angeldocs, Inc., which operated the fake clinic in Queens, called the Aki Life Health Center. Soonafter, NLPC filed a Complaint with the Internal Revenue Service against Angeldocs, alleging self-dealing and inurnment by Ogundu. We also provided the information to Isabel Vincent of the New York Post.A visit to the clinic by Post reporters found it \"dusty, unheated\" and having \"no visible patients or staff.\" According to the Post, \"Ogundu, who is the only clinic staff member, refused to say how many patients she treats or whether she has malpractice insurance.\" The building had never received a certificate of occupancy from New York City. Listed as a director on Angeldocs documents is a Dr. Jasmin Moshirpur, who told the Post that he had never heard of the charity.The news story prompted an investigation and State indictment. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman alleged that Ogundu \"stole\" a total of $373,000 that came from portions of twelve separate government grants. She swindled the federal government out of $195,000; New York state out of $87,000, and New York City out of $195,000. Ogundu allegedly used the funds to pay the mortgage and utilities on the building she owned, as well as buy and ship cars to her native Nigeria. Click here to download a pdf of the 29-page indictment.Ogundu could have received a sentence of up to 15 years. Fraud connected to human services' programs in New York City is endemic, often with the contrivance of elected officials. Given the seriousness of the charges on which Ogundu was convicted, and the widespread nature of the problem, we believe Ogundu got off lightly.When she was convicted in October, Schneiderman put out a press release claiming:√¢‚Ç¨≈ìToday√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s conviction sends a clear message: if you use taxpayer funds to line your own pocket, you will face serious consequences...We will continue to work with Comptroller DiNapoli and our law enforcement partners to use every tool at our disposal to crack down on anyone abusing the public trust.√¢‚Ç¨",
