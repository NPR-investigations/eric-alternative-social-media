That’s the price tag that we are facing,” Adams revealed Friday during a Caribbean Power Jam Radio interview. The new double-trouble estimate for New York City is also twice as much as the mayor has previously asked the Joe Biden administration to fork over to help pay for the burden on New Yorkers. “We have to ask ourselves, where we [were] already dealing with a potential $5, $6 billion budget deficit in the outyears. Where does that money come from?” said Adams, a day after he announced cuts to just about every city agency.    “That money comes from our schools. It comes from our public safety, our hospitals, our infrastructure, our ACS services, those are our tax dollars that it’s coming from and we got to see an impact in every service we have in the city,” said Adams.“And that is just inhumane on the part of the national government. And I really believe it’s irresponsible, that we have not had a real national response to what’s happening at our border,” he added.City Hall revealed on Friday that Adams will travel to El Paso, Texas, on Saturday and make multiple stops along the southern border.

A temporary place for people to work towards creating a living wage trade.\n\nPresident Trump created 8,700 Opportunity Zones, largely in low-income minority neighborhoods. Incentives have attracted some $75 billion in private investment to these communities.\n\nBiden's THuGs burned them down.\n\nBrowsing through this list will expose them and enlighten you as to how pervasive anti-Americans are.\n",

Additionally, if one moves up in their ranks, that person eventually attains the title of “apostle”.No thanks. Pass. Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Praying you do the same for your own sake! (Remember: You ultimately affect only you and forever’s a long time.) Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical.But, then again, everyone has a forever as well as a prerogative.Gamble at will.However, don’t forget what Scripture says, and several times at that:“Do not be deceived...”As is, people in THAT particular boat are in the process of being deceived.Tends to make one wonder why people gamble like that.That “S8W” thing isn’t even REMOTELY close, sorry to say. Biblically-speaking, there are no prophets nor are there any apostles today.In New Testament times when 1 Corinthians was written, “prophecy” is what we would say today as “preaching”. “To stand before The Lord and cause His Word to shine” is the initial meaning of the verb “to prophesy”. An “apostle” is one who witnessed the physical ascention of Jesus and was inspired by The Lord to pen the New Testament. The apostle Paul was the lone exception to being an eyewitness to the ascention of Jesus but it’s clearly explained in the book of Hebrews.A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.Here's the skinny on this “Eric von Anderseck” clown: He’s the self-proclaimed apostle to North America and that if you don’t go through him first, you flat-out did not hear from The Lord.No-brainer. Spooky stuff. According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them and according to 1 John 4:1, instructions are to test the spirits.",

In this age of deception, can we even trust anything we hear on the news?  We're not about how many people we can get into our group here.  We have no interest in being a group that is 5 miles wide and 2 inches deep.  In this group, you're going to hear things that 95% of today's average Christians may not understand because dealing with it would make them uncomfortable and today's average American Christian desires comfortable Christianity above all else.  That is because today's church is under very deep deception that Jesus told us to watch closely for in the last days.   If you are looking for deeper insights on where we really are on the prophetic timeline, then this may be a group you want to join.   If you are waiting to be raptured away before the tribulation begins, just before the real Christians will likely have to suffer persecution for their faith, you probably won't want to join this group.  ALL POSTING IN THIS GROUP SHOULD relate directly to last days events as prophesied in the Bible and ALL LINKS MUST HAVE AT LEAST A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS BEING LINKED TO.  All posts that do not relate directly to final days events as prophesied in the bible will be removed.

Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.&nbsp;On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’&nbsp;But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’”2 TIMOTHY 3:5&nbsp;(NLT)They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!https://www.biblegateway.com/A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them and according to 1 John 4:1, instructions are to test the spirits.Over the years, there has been quite a lot taught about Christianity. The problem is, many of those things simply are not in The Bible. Makes one wonder at times - Human opinion versus The Lord’s opinion...Wonder who would win? Additionally, Mosaic Law and/or other types of Legalism - Sad, huh? One thing to also remember is that there are dozens of each, cults and false religions. Many of them have done a SPECTACULAR job of messing up the Gospel message with either bogus teachings, fake literature based on fake Bibles and so on.Sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included. No one is perfect and there is no one righteous...AT ALL (Isaiah 64:6, John 8:7, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:21-26). EVERYONE needs a savior (1 John 1:8-10). As long as a person is able to identify from the heart with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus...ONLY...that person is justified (Galatians 2:20-21, Romans 5:10, Romans 6:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17). Anything above and beyond that is merely some human attempting to push some “religion”, or “sin management”, or “man-plan”. (SIDE NOTE – The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you. It’s more accurate and allowing Him to live in you is more feasible than merely trying to imitate behavior(s).“...and the truth shall set you free” (John 8:31-32). (Proverbs 3:5-6, Proverbs 27:17, Hebrews 4:12, Hebrews 10:14, Jude 1:23, etc. are additional motives.)Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.“To sanctify” means “to set apart”. “To put to its intended purpose,” in other words.In Hebrews 10:14, “For all time” means (may I have a drumroll, please) “For all time”. (That’s spiritually-speaking, or course. The rest of you? Welcome to being human.)(ANOTHER SIDE NOTE – In some translations, “For all time” is worded as “Forever”, “To the end” or “For eternity”.)",

Stay away from people like that!<br /><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>biblegateway.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.<br /><br />An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).<br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.<br /><br />According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them and according to 1 John 4:1, instructions are to test the spirits.<br /><br />Over the years, there has been quite a lot taught about Christianity. The problem is, many of those things simply are not in The Bible. Makes one wonder at times - Human opinion versus The Lord’s opinion...Wonder who would win? Additionally, Mosaic Law and/or other types of Legalism - Sad, huh? One thing to also remember is that there are dozens of each, cults and false religions. Many of them have done a SPECTACULAR job of messing up the Gospel message with either bogus teachings, fake literature based on fake Bibles and so on.<br /><br />Sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included. No one is perfect and there is no one righteous...AT ALL (Isaiah 64:6, John 8:7, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:21-26). EVERYONE needs a savior (1 John 1:8-10). As long as a person is able to identify from the heart with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus...ONLY...that person is justified (Galatians 2:20-21, Romans 5:10, Romans 6:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17). Anything above and beyond that is merely some human attempting to push some “religion”, or “sin management”, or “man-plan”. (SIDE NOTE – The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)<br /><br />Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you. It’s more accurate and allowing Him to live in you is more feasible than merely trying to imitate behavior(s).<br /><br />“...and the truth shall set you free” (John 8:31-32). (Proverbs 3:5-6, Proverbs 27:17, Hebrews 4:12, Hebrews 10:14, Jude 1:23, etc. are additional motives.)<br /><br />Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.<br /><br />“To sanctify” means “to set apart”. “To put to its intended purpose,” in other words.<br />In Hebrews 10:14, “For all time” means (may I have a drumroll, please) “For all time”. (That’s spiritually-speaking, or course. The rest of you? Welcome to being human.)<br />(ANOTHER SIDE NOTE – In some translations, “For all time” is worded as “Forever”, “To the end” or “For eternity”.)",
