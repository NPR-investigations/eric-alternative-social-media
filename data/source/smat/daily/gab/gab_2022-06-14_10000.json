My eyes don’t lie. You can’t lie to me I’ve seen what went on.”  “We will get justice, I will guarantee you,” said a representative of the family with Springfield NAACP Division last year. “We will definitely get justice.”Unfortunately, all their calls for justice fell on deaf ears.Illustrating the nature of police to circle the wagons to conceal the negligence of one of their own, immediately after Cole’s death, they issued a statement saying they didn’t know whether the police cruiser or the bullet killed Cole.Cole was shot in his left forearm,  hardly a deadly situation.

Making agreements for joint child custody is not only significantly simpler than engaging in protracted litigation but also far less expensive. Most of us are not millionaires, and attorneys are not inexpensive these days. It is definitely in the best interests of the children that these things are resolved swiftly and that everyone can go on with their life. Unfortunately, shared child custody is not always the best option, and in extreme cases, it may not be a choice at all. If at all possible, you should always prioritize shared custody. The findings indicate that children who maintain touch with both parents recover from the divorce far more quickly. Obviously, it is also crucial for a youngster to have two rather than just one role model. Numerous boys, for instance, have been discovered to have issues at a later age if they have lost permanent contact with their father. Joint custody is the healthiest option for the children, despite the fact that it might be challenging for the parent. Although courts typically favor joint custody agreements, it is not always viable to have joint custody. If you believe, for example, that your children would not be safe with the other parent, you should not choose shared custody. This might be due to an alcohol or drug issue. There is also a potential that the youngsters might be subjected to some form of maltreatment. If you feel that your children are not secure with the other parent for any reason, you should really do all in your power to obtain custody of your children. Even visiting privileges for the other parent might be denied until they get their lives in order.

In response to a comment made by WEF panelist, Lea Wermelin, on the responsibility of governments to make structural changes in our economy to combat climate change, Gore replied, “I have good news on this front.  We are about to enter an age of radical transparency.  I have been among those who have formed a new coalition called ‘Climate TRACE’…Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions.  It’s a coalition of artificial intelligence technology companies, NGOs, and universities, using data from 300 existing satellites from multiple countries, ground, sea and air-based censors, and internet data streams, to use machine-learning to create algorithms for every single sub-sector of the economy.” This colossal data-collection project aims to replace the current self-reporting system of greenhouse gas emissions by countries and companies, who have committed to net zero goals, by publishing reports of climate offenders so that countries, companies, and even individuals can be “held accountable.”  The Google-backed AI algorithm used by Climate TRACE appears to lay the framework for enforcing ESG initiatives heavily pushed by financial behemoths such as BlackRock, as well as a technocratic social and climate credit system.https://www.coreysdigs.com/technology/climate-trace-a-framework-for-esg-initiatives-and-social-climate-credit-system/",

They just ignore it. They do it anyway and if somebody doesn’t like it, you’ll have to sue them.”Second-grade students were asked: “When is the first time you noticed that people can be different races from you, what did you notice, and do you feel more comfortable around people who look like you?”“The goal here is to teach these kids that America is a white country of white supremacy and to destroy the nuclear family,” Hermann alleges. “If bad actors in the progressive Left are not stopped, then we’re just going to have a further divide in this country among our kids.”Continue https://www.theepochtimes.com/worry-over-student-surveying-leads-missouri-attorney-general-to-subpoena-seven-school-districts_4526142.html",
