We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

No serious person believes that a documents dispute was the real purpose of the raid. The idea that the FBI would search the home of a former president and potential 2024 GOP candidate over an ongoing (and not uncommon) disagreement over presidential records with the National Archives is absurd on its face.In his brief and self-congratulatory press conference Thursday, EVIL WEASEL JOE BIDEN RUNNING DOG Merrick Garland said he personally authorized the search on Trump’s home, that the Justice Department “does not take such a decision lightly,” and that it always seeks to use a “less intrusive means as an alternative to a search, and to narrowly scope any search that is undertaken.”In addition, it seems ERIC doesn’t exist to purge or update voter rolls so much as to inflate them, identifying 17 million new voters in 2020 compared to purging just 3 million from state voter rolls. Despite its failure to clean voter rolls, a majority of states are still using the system, which is run by a left-wing activist named David Becker. The purpose of ERIC by now is clear: It’s not about cleaning voter rolls but identifying and registering likely Democrat voters…This is just a sampling of what’s happening right now. The FBI raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence has rightly captured headlines and provoked outrage this week, but understand that the same powerful people, companies, and nonprofits that conspired to rig the 2020 election are right now rigging the 2024 election, using many of the same tactics. They’re doing it because they think they can get away with it — and if Republicans don’t act now to stop them, they certainly willhttps://thefederalist.com/2022/08/12/the-2024-election-is-being-rigged-right-now-in-plain-sight/※※#CommunistCHINA_RUNNINGDOG_JOEBIDEN#MAGA_PATRIOTS Take back ALL GOP PrecinctThe Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join Local GOP, take it over",

No serious person believes that a documents dispute was the real purpose of the raid. The idea that the FBI would search the home of a former president and potential 2024 GOP candidate over an ongoing (and not uncommon) disagreement over presidential records with the National Archives is absurd on its face.In his brief and self-congratulatory press conference Thursday, EVIL WEASEL JOE BIDEN RUNNING DOG Merrick Garland said he personally authorized the search on Trump’s home, that the Justice Department “does not take such a decision lightly,” and that it always seeks to use a “less intrusive means as an alternative to a search, and to narrowly scope any search that is undertaken.”In addition, it seems ERIC doesn’t exist to purge or update voter rolls so much as to inflate them, identifying 17 million new voters in 2020 compared to purging just 3 million from state voter rolls. Despite its failure to clean voter rolls, a majority of states are still using the system, which is run by a left-wing activist named David Becker.

NIGGER charged as adult following sexual assault arrestHOLLYWOOD, FLA.  - A vicious teenage nigger accused of kidnapping and repeatedly raping a woman on a Hollywood sidewalk is being charged as an adult.The news was announced in court, Friday morning, along with disturbing details about the crime 15-year-old Terry Berger-Smith is accused of committing on June 10.Prosecutors said the nigger stalked a woman and approached her on the 300 block of South Park Road.“He told her he wanted to add her to his collection, repeatedly raped, livestreamed the incident to his friend,” said prosecutor Eric Linder. “When the victim asked if he had any sexually transmitted diseases, he told her he had AIDS.”Police arrested Berger-Smith, then 14, three days later.After the Broward State Attorney’s Office considered the facts and evidence against Berger-Smith, a panel of senior prosecutors decided the responsible course of action was to file criminal charges in the adult system.The teen faces four counts of sexual battery and one count of kidnapping.Berger-Smith’s attorney, Jim Lewis, expressed his misgivings about his client being tried as an adult.“I thought we’d learned the lessons from years ago that we don’t take kids and put them in an adult situation,” he said. “It’s a very serious crime; we’re maintaining our innocence. Nobody’s saying that he’s guilty, but still, it’s a case that you play out in juvenile court.”Berger-Smith was held in a juvenile detention center until the state moved him into the Broward County jail system.This decision came after the state attorney’s office considered Berger-Smith’s prior violent criminal history and the fact that he was recently released from a juvenile facility in New York, where he spent 18 months.“At the age of 12, out of the state of New York, he committed and attempted rape at knifepoint,” said Linder. “In the process of attempting to rape the victim, he ripped out the victim’s tooth and kept it as a trophy, Your Honor. He was also a co-defendant in a robbery where the victim was viciously beaten.”Police said Berger-Smith may also be connected to another crime in Hollywood.A woman said the teen attacked her in late May. To date, he has not been charged in this case.https://youtu.be/QnsFw5Xw7Ck",
