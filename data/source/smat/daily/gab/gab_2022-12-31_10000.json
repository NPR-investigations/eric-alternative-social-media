Michael Jones if he had any predictions for 2023. Here's an abridged and edited transcript.Kevin Barrett: At this time last year, we went from 2021 to 2022. And we didn't know that this was going to be the year where we went from the virus to the Russians.So what will it be this year? An alien invasion?Michael Jones: I don't know. It seems that everything – there is a Latin saying motus in fine velocior, “things speed up towards the end”. So we don't really have a break in the crises anymore. It's just one thing after another. The COVID issue has erased the massive crisis before… And now we are back with a war in Ukraine. Who knows what will happen? But I'll make a prediction. The war in Ukraine is going to end in 2023 and the Russians are going to win. And whether that leads to US troops on the ground and World War III and nuclear war, I can't predict at this point.Kevin Barrett: 2022 was the year nuclear war became a thing. And I don't think that's a good thing. It's back to the duck and cover drills! The United Nations tells us that nuclear war is likely again. And the media tells us which parts of the United States will be blown up if all-out thermonuclear war breaks out. And New York City is distributing a nuclear war PSA leaflet telling New Yorkers to stick their heads under their desks and then between their legs and kiss \"it\" goodbye, so to speak. Like the old hippie ad said.So, Mike, what do you think about this nuclear war comeback, which was very current when we were kids in the early 1960s? And then it kind of faded. It became less trendy and hip. And now, hey, it's a thing! And I wish it wasn't.Michael Jones:I was a teenager in high school during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Long queues at the confessional back then. And this is much worse. I trusted John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev far more than anyone in the Biden administration. There is a sense of recklessness in Washington right now, a sense of recklessness that seems to be heading for nuclear war. I think the first step, the preparatory step, will be whether US ground troops will be placed in Ukraine. Of course there are troops there now. They are the ones in charge of those batteries with himar missiles. But will there be a Vietnam-style invasion of US troops if Bakhmut fails? Bakhmut goes down. It's unrelenting. The question is what will happen at that point and who will be in charge? Who is in charge at the moment? I do not know. I cannot answer this question. I just feel like complete recklessness is coming from Washington and there are no adults in the room anymore.Kevin Barrett: It seems so. In New York, the mayor, Eric Adams, seems to be in charge. But if thermonuclear missiles hit New York City… Manhattan is a fairly small, densely populated place. As The New York Times points out, it's game over, baby. You can't hide in New York. All this is insane. But that applies almost everywhere. So yes, it appears there are no adults in the room. There are only neocons in the room. Maybe we shouldn't have let them get away with 9/11.2022 was the year that Russia kept running out of weapons. From March, Putin was without ammunition all the way through December 26: “Russia is out of missiles.” There is story after story that Russia is always out of arms, but it never quite runs out. They keep some in reserve or take a few out of their whatevers. I do not know.So let's take a look at your view on the bigger issue, Mike, on how and why this war has become the big issue of 2022.Michael Jones: Well, a war is a big issue. But the other point is that I have never experienced such blatant war propaganda as now. And I must say that the English are even worse than the Americans in this regard. Shameless propaganda! From the specter of Kiev to whatever it is now, the Russians are always wrong.Kevin Barrett: Don't forget the heroic martyrs of Snake Island.Michael Jones: The Martyrs of Serpent Island. Putin is dying of some disease. He continues to die at the same time as the Russians run out of weapons. So basically all you can say is that they say the exact opposite of the truth. What they are actually saying is that NATO is out of arms. NATO has the supply problems, not the Russians.Kevin Barrett: And Biden has a worse health problem than Putin. He probably falls down the stairs and soils his pants. That doesn't sound like Putin. That sounds more like Biden.Michael Jones: It's gotten to the point where you just have to turn around what you read in the papers and realize that everything they say about Russia is true for NATO.Read morehttps://www.frontnieuws.com/drs-e-michael-jones-de-oorlog-in-oekraine-eindigt-in-2023-en-de-russen-gaan-winnen/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=notification&amp;utm_id=649060",
