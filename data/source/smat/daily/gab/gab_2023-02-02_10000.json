          "content": "Hunter Biden Did Not Register as an Agent of a Foreign Coutry, But He Was in Violation of the LawHunter Biden lobbied for Burisma and even tried to wrangle visas for Ukrainians who had already been turned down. But, he failed to register as an agent for Burisma or Ukraine.That is a violation of the law under FARA. But, Hunter could not register as a foreign agent as his father was vice president at the time and the optics would have been enormously bad. Therefore, he apparently decided to break the law knowingly in order to protect his influence-peddling scheme.Recent revelations from Hunter’s laptop tell how he used his daddy’s name all over the world. The first email was revealed by Miranda DeVine and contained 22 talking points on Ukraine that Hunter sent to Devon Archer in order to aid Burisma 2 weeks before Joe was scheduled to arrive,    Here is a screenshot of Hunter Biden’s original 22-point Ukraine email cited in the column. Note the strategic detail. http://pic.twitter.com/kt6GNdQD85    — Miranda Devine (@mirandadevine) January 23, 2023The second email showed that Hunter shared classified documents with Burisma for them to use to their advantage in dealing with the United States. He was also to help in getting visas for Burisma employees.From The Gateway PunditIn the email string below taken from the Hunter laptop, Sandweg emailed Eric Schwerin at Rosemont Seneca (Hunter Biden’s firm) on November 2, 2015.  Sandveg relayed information on one of the individuals from Burisma for whom Hunter was trying to get a visa for was Mr. Zlochevskyi.Sandweg in his email says that he obtained a search:    …from the Department of Homeland Security and Customs databases did not reveal any prohibitions on Mr. Zlochevskyi ability to enter the United States. Unfortunately, after receiving the initial report, I suspected that the individual I asked to run the search only queried DHS/Customs databases and not State Department databases. As such, I asked another individual to query both databases. This search revealed the cancellation of the visa and the legal basis for the cancellation.Sandweg includes two attachments, one of which is labeled “Zlochevski Visa Denial”.Email number three:On Monday TGP uncovered a third email showing more Biden family crimes related to classified information and espionage. The email discovered on Hunter Biden’s laptop was sent from Blue Star Strategies, a firm that has reportedly been under investigation by the DOJ since 2021.  The email that was sent in December 2015 had an attachment that included classified information from a White House conference call on Joe Biden’s upcoming trip to Ukraine.  This email was also sent to Burisma and it implicates Joe Biden.And number 4 related to Hunter not registering as a foreign agent.From The Gateway PunditIn 2017 General Michael Flynn was sentenced and along with it he was also forced to admit to “making materially false statements in multiple documents filed pursuant to FARA.”  The DOJ reportedly obtained Flynn’s guilty plea by threatening his son with the alleged crime of not filling out a FARA application.In 2018, Paul Manafort “pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to two counts: (i) conspiracy to commit multiple offenses, including violating FARA by failing to register and by providing false statements in a document filed with FARA.”  Manafort was sent to prison.FARA violations were used against these two individuals who were close to President Trump.In Hunter’s laptop were a number of emails that show that Hunter Biden acted as a foreign agent.  Hunter’s actions in Ukraine with Burisma were one example.https://roccistuccishow.com/hunter-biden-did-not-register-as-an-agent-of-a-foreign-coutry-but-he-was-in-violation-of-the-law/",
          "contentraw": "Hunter Biden Did Not Register as an Agent of a Foreign Coutry, But He Was in Violation of the Law<br /><br />Hunter Biden lobbied for Burisma and even tried to wrangle visas for Ukrainians who had already been turned down. But, he failed to register as an agent for Burisma or Ukraine.<br /><br />That is a violation of the law under FARA. But, Hunter could not register as a foreign agent as his father was vice president at the time and the optics would have been enormously bad. Therefore, he apparently decided to break the law knowingly in order to protect his influence-peddling scheme.<br /><br />Recent revelations from Hunter’s laptop tell how he used his daddy’s name all over the world. The first email was revealed by Miranda DeVine and contained 22 talking points on Ukraine that Hunter sent to Devon Archer in order to aid Burisma 2 weeks before Joe was scheduled to arrive,<br /><br />    Here is a screenshot of Hunter Biden’s original 22-point Ukraine email cited in the column. Note the strategic detail. <a href=\"http://pic.twitter.com/kt6GNdQD85\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>pic.twitter.com/kt6GNdQD85<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />    — Miranda Devine (<a href=\"https://gab.com/mirandadevine\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@mirandadevine<\/a>) January 23, 2023<br /><br />The second email showed that Hunter shared classified documents with Burisma for them to use to their advantage in dealing with the United States. He was also to help in getting visas for Burisma employees.<br /><br />From The Gateway Pundit<br /><br />In the email string below taken from the Hunter laptop, Sandweg emailed Eric Schwerin at Rosemont Seneca (Hunter Biden’s firm) on November 2, 2015.  Sandveg relayed information on one of the individuals from Burisma for whom Hunter was trying to get a visa for was Mr. Zlochevskyi.<br /><br />Sandweg in his email says that he obtained a search:<br /><br />    …from the Department of Homeland Security and Customs databases did not reveal any prohibitions on Mr. Zlochevskyi ability to enter the United States. Unfortunately, after receiving the initial report, I suspected that the individual I asked to run the search only queried DHS/Customs databases and not State Department databases. As such, I asked another individual to query both databases. This search revealed the cancellation of the visa and the legal basis for the cancellation.<br /><br />Sandweg includes two attachments, one of which is labeled “Zlochevski Visa Denial”.<br /><br />Email number three:<br /><br />On Monday TGP uncovered a third email showing more Biden family crimes related to classified information and espionage. <br /><br />The email discovered on Hunter Biden’s laptop was sent from Blue Star Strategies, a firm that has reportedly been under investigation by the DOJ since 2021.  The email that was sent in December 2015 had an attachment that included classified information from a White House conference call on Joe Biden’s upcoming trip to Ukraine.  This email was also sent to Burisma and it implicates Joe Biden.<br /><br />And number 4 related to Hunter not registering as a foreign agent.<br /><br />From The Gateway Pundit<br /><br />In 2017 General Michael Flynn was sentenced and along with it he was also forced to admit to “making materially false statements in multiple documents filed pursuant to FARA.”  The DOJ reportedly obtained Flynn’s guilty plea by threatening his son with the alleged crime of not filling out a FARA application.<br /><br />In 2018, Paul Manafort “pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to two counts: (i) conspiracy to commit multiple offenses, including violating FARA by failing to register and by providing false statements in a document filed with FARA.”  Manafort was sent to prison.<br /><br />FARA violations were used against these two individuals who were close to President Trump.<br /><br />In Hunter’s laptop were a number of emails that show that Hunter Biden acted as a foreign agent.  Hunter’s actions in Ukraine with Burisma were one example.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://roccistuccishow.com/hunter-biden-did-not-register-as-an-agent-of-a-foreign-coutry-but-he-was-in-violation-of-the-law/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>roccistuccishow.com/hunter-biden-did-not-regi<span class=\"invisible\">ster-as-an-agent-of-a-foreign-coutry-but-he-was-in-violation-of-the-law/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
