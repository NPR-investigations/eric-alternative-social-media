So they found out where he was and eventually took me to a Jimmy Vaughan show in a club in Dallas and I got to meet Stevie and his brother and shake their hands. Stevie was fried and paranoid that he was taking attention away from his brother because he had a gold album out (Texas Flood) and people wanted to meet him, so he left. When I returned home to Louisiana after working there in 1985 I had a dream that a plane taking Stevie Ray Vaughan, Ted Nugent, and Eric Clapton to the Texxas Jam concert in Dallas had trouble and landed at our local airport. In the dream I heard this announced on the radio, and that they were taking a helicopter to catch another plane in Alexandria. So I went outside to see if I could see them fly over. I saw the helicopter going right over our house and then....BOOM...the engine exploded and they were going around and around. I panicked thinking it was falling on our house and hid under the edge of the roof, but they crashed in the woods on the other side of my aunt`s house. It was a terrifying realistic dream. So it`s very odd what happened later.",

So they found out where he was and eventually took me to a Jimmy Vaughan show in a club in Dallas and I got to meet Stevie and his brother and shake their hands. Stevie was fried and paranoid that he was taking attention away from his brother because he had a gold album out (Texas Flood) and people wanted to meet him, so he left. <br /><br />When I returned home to Louisiana after working there in 1985 I had a dream that a plane taking Stevie Ray Vaughan, Ted Nugent, and Eric Clapton to the Texxas Jam concert in Dallas had trouble and landed at our local airport. In the dream I heard this announced on the radio, and that they were taking a helicopter to catch another plane in Alexandria. So I went outside to see if I could see them fly over. I saw the helicopter going right over our house and then....BOOM...the engine exploded and they were going around and around. I panicked thinking it was falling on our house and hid under the edge of the roof, but they crashed in the woods on the other side of my aunt`s house. It was a terrifying realistic dream. So it`s very odd what happened later.",
