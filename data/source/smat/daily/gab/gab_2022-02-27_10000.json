I haven’t done a ton of research yet in regards to Tartaria, mud floods, etc. but thought it was important for me to share some of my thoughts about the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 which was held in Chicago Illinois, a subject which always seems to be brought up in Tartaria research. I was born and raised in Chicago. I have visited the former site of this exposition many of times since my childhood. Chicago, fortunately has many great museums all along our lakefront, and my favorite has always been “The Museum of Science and Industry” located in Jackson Park, the former location of the Worlds Fair.As I later found out, the building that houses this museum today was one of the original buildings that was built specifically for the fair, and as we are told, this building is still standing today because it was built stronger and better than the rest due to it originally housing the worlds finest artwork of that time period, hence it was called the Fine Arts Building. I will start this series of posts with a recommendation. If you haven’t yet read “Devil in the White City”, please do so. Although it’s considered fiction, the author, Eric Larson, did his research into the fine details of the fair and the people most involved with its conception, design, construction and most importantly, it’s destruction after it ended.",
