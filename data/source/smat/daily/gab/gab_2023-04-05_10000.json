            "description": "More Prisoners on Gab: '@Covfefe_777 \n\nTechnofog has correctly pointed out that Trump’s indictment does not state which federal laws he violated. \n\nHowever, if you read the indictment (attached below), each of the 34 charges alleges a breach of NY Penal Law 175.10:\n\n“Section 175.10 - Falsifying business records in the first degree\n\nA person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he commits the crime of falsifying business records in the second degree, and when his intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.\n\nFalsifying business records in the first degree is a class E felony.”\n\nSo to prove the charges, they will have to show:\n\n1. an intention hide another crime, which I assume will be violating federal campaign finance laws (this is the part that has not been identified, as Technofog points out).\n2. that he committed a a breach of penal law 175.05. Let’s see what that offence is about:\n\n“N.Y. Penal Law § 175.05\n\nA person is guilty of falsifying business records in the second degree when, with intent to defraud, he:\n1. Makes or causes a false entry in the business records of an enterprise; or\n2. Alters, erases, obliterates, deletes, removes or destroys a true entry in the business records of an enterprise; or\n3. Omits to make a true entry in the business records of an enterprise in violation of a duty to do so which he knows to be imposed upon him by law or by the nature of his position; or\n4. Prevents the making of a true entry or causes the omission thereof in the business records of an enterprise.\nFalsifying business records in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor.”\n\nSo, my expectation is that Bragg will try to prove 4., namely that Trump prevented the accurate recording of true entries in the business records by directing Michael Cohen to make hush payments with his own money.\n\nBragg will then rely on Trump’s alleged subsequent repayments of that money to Cohen as circumstantial evidence of both his alleged prevention of true records under 175.05 and his intent to conceal a breach of federal campaign finance laws as required to prove 175.10. \n\nYou can already see how circular all of that reasoning will be. I suspect the DA’s office are hoping that pre-trial discovery orders will throw up a text message or an email that somehow helps them prove that Trump said something to Cohen that amounts to an actual direction to conceal the payment AND prove that the underlying intention was to hide a breach of (as yet unspecified) campaign finance laws.\n\nYou may well ask, why not just charge Trump with the easier to prove misdemeanour case under 175.05? The reason is that the misdemeanour has a two year statute of limitations so they were out of time. To get around that problem Bragg had to upgrade the charges to a felony under 175.10 by alleging it was a cover up of another offence. What exactly was that other offence? So far that is one of the biggest holes in this case, which may turn out to be a little more than a vexatious fishing expedition.\n\nIn all, as John Bolton complained, this is an extremely weak and tenuous prosecution case that Trump’s lawyers will most likely rip to shreds.\n\nhttps://www.manhattanda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Donald-J.-Trump-Indictment.pdf\n\n@paulf @x22report'",

New Yorkers who survived the city during the pandemic remember the long months when Bragg&#39;s office became a revolving door for career criminals who hit up the streets in broad daylight and had many residents fearing the subways. While Bragg&#39;s office was preparing to indict Trump, he let violent reoffenders continue to wreak havoc.

Transgender medical treatments for children and teens have been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and are endorsed by major medical associations.But supporters of the legislation have contended such care is not reversible or carries side effects that only an adult — and not a minor’s parent — can consent to.Lawmakers also banned gender-transition surgeries for minors in the state, though hospital representatives in Indiana told lawmakers doctors do not perform genital surgeries for minors or provide them surgery referrals.At least 12 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia. Federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas, and nearly two dozen states are considering bills this year to restrict or ban care.https://apnews.com/article/indiana-governor-gender-affirming-care-ban-09bdabec268dbd8d79397a43f21694ed",

Trump surrenders to authorities on Tuesday, he may undergo a DNA collection process more befitting a murder suspect than a person falsely accused of paying hush money to a washed-up adult actress, per a source in General Eric M. Smith’s office...According to him, the general’s office, via U.S. Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER,) has obtained an email sent from Lisa DelPizzo, chief of the Manhattan D.A.’s trial division, to Alvin Bragg, in which she asks whether the office will collect a buccal swab, blood, and “at least 100 hair samples” from President Trump Tuesday afternoon. She also asked for Bragg’s thoughts on whether the Secret Service would try to block DNA collection.ARCYBER, our source said, did not intercept a reply but forwarded DelPizzo’s email to Gen. Smith since it seemed like a portent that Bragg might entrap Trump with additional, albeit fictitious, charges.In homicide and sexual assault cases, law enforcement routinely mouth-swabs suspects and collects hair follicles. In most cases, a suspect (or even a witness) is asked to surrender his DNA voluntarily; but refusal inevitably results in police hostility and a warrant compelling cooperation by force, if necessary. In specific DUI investigations, cops can get a warrant for a blood draw to check for intoxicants.However, there is no case law mandating the collection of DNA evidence from a person charged with financial crimes, via attorney Bill Cullen of the Constitutional Law Foundation“Not only is there no precedent for indicting a president, but there’s also none that I’m aware of for swabbing or taking hair roots from anyone suspected of financial misdemeanors, and if indeed they intend to do that, no honest judge would sign a warrant—there’s no probable cause. The police can ask, of course, but no one should voluntarily talk to or help them. Alvin Bragg’s indictment is still sealed, which I find suspicious, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the charges against Trump are spurious,” Mr. Cullen said.Our source in Gen. Smith’s office speculated as to why Bragg wants Trump’s DNA.“It’s not outside the realm of possibility that Bragg, who is Deep State, wants to make sure the Trump he has in custody is the Real Donald Trump and not a clone, doppelganger, or body double. I don’t see how DNA could exclude a clone, but it could detect a double,” he said. “Or, of course, they might just try to frame him for something else once he gets in there.”We asked our source to comment on theories that the real President Trump is stashed away at NORAD or AREA 51, while a doppelganger lives at Mar-a-Lago and makes public appearances at rallies.“If that were true, it would be outside the ambit of what I can say,” he said.Regardless, he said Gen. Smith forwarded DelPizzo’s email to President Trump and his legal team.As reported yesterday, Gen. Smith implored Trump to hold fast at Mar-a-Lago and avoid traveling to New York, but Trump wouldn’t heed the advice. They plan to speak again Sunday, our source said.",

While Bragg's office was preparing to indict Trump, he let violent reoffenders continue to wreak havoc. In August, Mayor Eric Adams revealed that the same 10 criminals made up nearly 500 crimes and that 60 percent of them were still roaming the streets at that time. Adams, who promised New Yorkers he would crack down on crime that had risen during the pandemic, criticized him, as well as State Governor Kathy Hochul. In February 2022, Bragg walked back a little on his policies, sending out a memo that made it clear to all his staff that any crime involving a firearm would be prosecuted as a felony — reversing the stance he had taken just a month before. Although crime is currently at the same rate as the same time last year, felony assault continues be heightened at 8.5 percent. Despite murder and robbery being down, 84 homicides and more than 3,500 robberies have occurred this year in the Big Apple. As Bragg's office focused on indicting Trump, these career criminals ran the streets of New York, repeatedly terrorizing citizens and wreaking havoc.  Harold Gooding has been arrested more than 100 times Harold Gooding, 53, has more than 70 arrests just for theft alone and has been taken into custody more than 100 timesAs of August, Harold Gooding, 53, has been busted for dozens of larceny charges - including four heists in Target. The 53-year-old already has 15 convictions to his name, as well as 14 failures to show in court following his prolific crime spree.He has rocketed to number one on the NYPD's list for repeat offenders following his torrent of thefts.

Despite murder and robbery being down, 84 homicides and more than 3,500 robberies have occurred this year in the Big Apple. <br /><br />As Bragg's office focused on indicting Trump, these career criminals ran the streets of New York, repeatedly terrorizing citizens and wreaking havoc.  <br /><br />Harold Gooding has been arrested more than 100 times <br /><br />Harold Gooding, 53, has more than 70 arrests just for theft alone and has been taken into custody more than 100 times<br /><br />As of August, Harold Gooding, 53, has been busted for dozens of larceny charges - including four heists in Target. <br /><br />The 53-year-old already has 15 convictions to his name, as well as 14 failures to show in court following his prolific crime spree.<br /><br />He has rocketed to number one on the NYPD's list for repeat offenders following his torrent of thefts. <br /><br />He has more than 70 arrests just for theft alone.  <br /><br />Michelle McKelley calls herself a 'professional booster' and told police they wouldn't be 'stopping my hustle' <br /><br />Michelle Kelley, 41, allegedly confessed to authorities that she was a 'professional booster.'

Trump hasn’t stopped White Hat efforts to cleanse the nation of Deep State traitors and saboteurs, a source in General Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News. On Saturday, United States Marines under Gen. Smith’s command arrested January 6 Committee architect Liz Cheney at her posh home in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a ritzy tourist town famous for its mountainous landscape and majestic views of the nearby Grand Tetons.The belated arrest comes nearly two years after a military court, in May 2021, indicted Cheney on charges of treason and interfering in the 2020 presidential election. In late 2022, the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps revised the indictment to include the charge of seditious conspiracy, a response to her role on the January 6 Committee, which sought to falsely charge President Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and attempts to “incite,” “assist,” or “aid or comfort” an insurrection. Our source said that Cheney would face a military tribunal to answer for her crimes against America and its people.He said several factors contributed to the prolonged delay between indictment and arrest: When it became clear the January 6 Committee’s implausible allegations against President Trump held no weight, JAG put her on a watchlist while opting to pursue other Deep State despots. Also, like many Deep Staters, Cheney seldom lived or traveled alone, and she, the daughter of a dictatorial former vice president, still had Secret Service protection.Our source said that the military prefers to isolate Deep Staters before affecting an arrest. However, he admitted the postponement was highly unusual.Until recently, Cheney had been hiding amidst a throng of armed security—private and taxpayer-funded–and “Never Trump” RINOs and Democrats at her house in McClean, Virginia, a Deep State bastion. On March 29, she and two Secret Service agents traveled aboard a commercial plane from Dulles International Airport to blustery Jackson, Wyoming, where they caught a limo to her $6m Creek Ranch cabin.When Gen. Smith verified Cheney’s itinerary, he activated a Marine reconnaissance platoon, ordering them to travel to Wyoming and arrest her by any means necessary. To maintain the element of surprise, they avoided public transportation and were flown from Camp Pendleton to Jackson, a 1,800-mile, 7-hour round trip, on a V-22 Osprey, the Corps’ accident-prone VTOL aircraft. Since neither the V-22 nor the CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter—also considered to fill the mission role—had a ferry range of 1,800 miles, Gen. Smith tasked a KC-135 Stratotanker, a massive military refueling plane, with orbiting the AO and refueling the V-22 after the Marines had grabbed Cheney.The V-22 touched down in a clearing slip-covered in snow two kilometers southeast of Cheney’s home at approximately 1:00 a.m. The Marines deplaned wearing cold-weather gear and armed with lethal and non-lethal weapons, then hiked across the frozen ground until they reached the wooden fence and wrought iron gate that opened onto Cheney’s expansive property. They disabled several surveillance cameras before stealthily approaching the house. Light shone through upstairs and downstairs windows, but the Marines saw no movement. After circumventing a home security system and a “Ring” doorbell, they prepared to breach the door—and surprisingly found it unlocked.No sooner had the lead element stepped into the foyer than a Secret Service agent, bewildered and shocked, fumbled for the sidearm on his hip. He took three rounds to the head from suppresser-equipped rifles and fell down dead. His death moan alerted the second agent, who shouted up a staircase, “Get up! Get up! They’re coming for you,” and took cover behind a wall.“The Marines gave him an ultimatum: surrender or die. They told him they surrounded the place and had a military warrant for Cheney. About this time, Cheney was screaming in her bedroom. She said kill the intruders. He must have felt pragmatic with self-preservation. The guy was smart–dropped his pistol, said something like f*** that bitch, and surrendered. He escorted the Marines straight to Cheney’s bedroom,” our source said.Cheney, wearing only a nightgown and slippers, was reaching for her cell phone when the Marines burst into the bedroom and hit her with Tasers, causing her to collapse to the floor and wiggle around like a sun-scorched worm.
