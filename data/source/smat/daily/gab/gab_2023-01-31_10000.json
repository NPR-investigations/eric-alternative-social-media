          "content": "Historians such as historian Ronald Hutton argue that the festival must have pre-Christian origins.[6] Some scholars argue that the date of Imbolc was significant in Ireland since the Neolithic period.[7] A few passage tombs in Ireland are aligned with the sunrise around the times of Imbolc and Samhain. This includes the Mound of the Hostages on the Hill of Tara,[8][9] and Cairn L at Slieve na Calliagh.[10] Frank Prendergast argues that this alignment is so rare that it is rather a product of chance.[11]The etymology of Imbolc or Imbolg is unclear. The most common explanation is that it comes from the Old Irish i mbolc (Modern Irish: i mbolg), meaning 'in the belly', and refers to the pregnancy of ewes at this time of year.[12] Joseph Vendryes linked it to the Old Irish verb folcaim, 'to wash/cleanse oneself'. He suggested that it referred to a ritual cleansing, similar to the ancient Roman festival Februa or Lupercalia, which took place at the same time of year.[13][14] Eric P. Hamp derives it from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning both 'milk' and 'cleansing'.[15] Professor Alan Ward derives it from the Proto-Celtic *embibolgon, 'budding'.[16] The early 10th century Cormac's Glossary has an entry for Oímelc, calling it the beginning of spring and deriving it from oí-melg ('ewe milk'), explaining it as \"the time that sheep's milk comes\".[17] However, linguists believe this is the writer's own respelling of the word to give it an understandable etymology.[18]The Táin Bó Cúailnge ('Cattle Raid of Cooley') indicates that Imbolc (spelt imolg) is three months after the 1 November festival of Samhain.[19] Imbolc is mentioned in another Old Irish poem about the Táin in the Metrical Dindshenchas: \"iar n-imbulc, ba garb a ngeilt\", which Edward Gwynn translates \"after Candlemas, rough was their herding\".[15] Candlemas is the Christian holy day which falls on 2 February and is known in Irish as Lá Fhéile Muire na gCoinneal, 'feast day of Mary of the Candles'.[20]Hutton writes that Imbolc must have been \"important enough for its date to be dedicated subsequently to Brigid … the Mother Saint of Ireland\".[6] Cogitosus, writing in the late 7th century, first mentions a feast day of Saint Brigid being observed in Kildare on 1 February.[21] Brigid is said to have lived in the 6th century and founded the important monastery of Kildare. She became the focus of a major cult. However, there are few historical facts about her, and her early hagiographies \"are mainly anecdotes and miracle stories, some of which are deeply rooted in Irish pagan folklore\".[22] It is suggested that Saint Brigid is based on Brigid, a Gaelic goddess.[23] Like the saint, the goddess is associated with wisdom, poetry, healing, protection, blacksmithing and domesticated animals, according to Cormac's Glossary and Lebor Gabála Érenn.[21][24] It is suggested that the festival, which celebrates the onset of spring, is linked with Brigid in her role as a fertility goddess.[25] According to Hutton, it could be that the goddess Brigid was already linked to Imbolc and this was continued by making it the saint's feast day. Or it could be that Imbolc's association with milk drew the saint to it, because of a legend that she had been the wet-nurse of Christ.[6]",
