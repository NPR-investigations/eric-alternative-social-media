Some people even believe when they visit the beach or climb atop a mountain that they are able to see the horizon curve downwards far in the distance.  The reality is, however, that anyone thinking they can see curvature on the horizon from any altitude is suffering from a serious case of confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.  <br /><br />To begin with, the glass used in all commercial airplane passenger windows is actually round, layered and slightly curved which distorts the edges giving the impression that the horizon and other straight lines curve downwards.  These rounded windows have the effect of evenly distributing pressure and reducing the likelihood of cracks or breaks because they have no corners for stress to concentrate making them better at withstanding pressure.

The year closed with a total of 691 mass shootings and several hundred deaths related to these incidents in total, according to information collected by the Gun Violence Archive. Estimates reveal that the mass shooters are overwhelmingly black. The grim milestone was largely ignored by the liberal Brookings Institute, which instead praised the Department of Justice's aggressive crackdown on political activity as the reason for why there weren't any far-right or 'white supremacist' attacks. The FBI's resources are currently preoccupied with soliciting alleged victims of 'hate crimes' and 'confronting white supremacy,' as violent threats",

Hutchinson testified that it was, in fact, her handwriting, but following the hearing, Herschmann's team disputed those assertions.A spokesperson for Herschmann told ABC News on Tuesday evening that, \"The handwritten note that Cassidy Hutchinson testified was written by her was in fact written by Eric Herschmann on January 6, 2021.\" They added that, \"All sources with direct knowledge and law enforcement have and will confirm that it was written by Mr. Herschmann.\" In response to the allegations that Hutchinson had lied, the Jan. 6 Committee released a statement of their own. \"The committee has done its diligence on this and found Ms. Hutchinson's account of this matter credible,\" a spokesperson said. \"While we understand that she and Mr. Herschmann may have differing recollections of who wrote the note, what's ultimately important is that both White House officials believed that the President should have immediately instructed his supporters to leave the Capitol building.\" \"The note memorialized this, but Mr. Trump did not take that action at the time.\" During the hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Liz Cheney held up the handwritten note, and asked Hutchinson if it was hers. \"That's a note that I wrote at the direction of the chief of staff on Jan. 6, likely around 3:00,\" Hutchinson responded, adding that it was her handwriting when pressed on the fact that it was written on the chief of staff note card. Hutchinson did not entirely exclude Herschmann from her story, claiming that he suggested an amending the note. A former top aide to Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Hutchinson said her boss handed her a note card and pen on January 6, and asked her to transcribe a statement for Trump to release as the Capitol riot took place. Herschmann, for his part, has testified to the Jan. 6 Committee on numerous occasions. Herschmann's statement followed the news earlier Tuesday night that two Secret Service agents are reportedly willing to testify that then-President Trump did not lunge at a steering wheel or assault them in an attempt to go to the Capitol during the riot on January 6, 2021 as Hutchingson claimed in her testimony.",

Some people even believe when they visit the beach or climb atop a mountain that they are able to see the horizon curve downwards far in the distance.  The reality is, however, that anyone thinking they can see curvature on the horizon from any altitude is suffering from a serious case of confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.  To begin with, the glass used in all commercial airplane passenger windows is actually round, layered and slightly curved which distorts the edges giving the impression that the horizon and other straight lines curve downwards.  These rounded windows have the effect of evenly distributing pressure and reducing the likelihood of cracks or breaks because they have no corners for stress to concentrate making them better at withstanding pressure.  Unfortunately though, these windows also have the strange side-effect of causing people to believe that the Earth is a globe because they mistake the curvature of the glass for that of the horizon...

Why do they hide Antarctica from us, other lands beyond Antarctica ?This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language). Accounts set to &#39;Private&#39;, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers.This group has never, and will never, ask for a dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the multitudes of facts with undeniable evidence evoking our true Level and Stationary Earth Plane. Truth is like a breath of fresh air, Truth will break you free from the Echo Chamber of Deception.<br /><\/li><\/ul>",

Liz Cheney displayed a handwritten note which Hutchinson testified she wrote after Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows handed her a note card and pen to take his dictation.Sources familiar with the matter said that Herschmann had previously told the committee that he had penned the note.“The handwritten note that Cassidy Hutchinson testified was written by her was in fact written by Eric Herschmann on January 6, 2021,” a spokesperson for Herschmann told ABC News Tuesday evening.“All sources with direct knowledge and law enforcement have and will confirm that it was written by Mr. Herschmann,” the spokesperson said.More… This was their “star witness.”",

But she did say that she was “disgusted” at Trump’s tweet about Pence during the siege.“It was unpatriotic, it was un-American, and you were watching the Capitol building get defaced over a lie,” Hutchinson said, adding that, “I still struggle to work through the emotions of that.”Members of the panel praised Hutchinson’s bravery for testifying and said that other witnesses had been intimidated and did not cooperate.",

Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide, made several claims under oath that were debunked within hours, with the committee taking another blow to its already non-existent credibility in the process.The supposed “bombshell” was a wild tale about a 74-year-old Trump fighting through two secret service agents and grabbing the steering wheel in order to try to get to the Capitol. As I said at the time, even if that were true, what exactly does it prove? Is there evidence Trump wanted to go there to enact a coup? He had just encouraged people to go there to peacefully protest. Wouldn’t it make more sense that he wanted to go there to help lead said peaceful protest?Regardless, the steering wheel claim wasn’t true because these types of ridiculous allegations about Trump are almost never true. To further prove that, we now have official word from the US Secret Service spokesman that the agents involved are ready to testify.Not shockingly, the lies didn’t stop there. Hutchinson also claimed to have written a note regarding Trump making a statement about the January 6th riot. In reality, it was written by Eric Herschmann, a White House lawyer. He has now spoken publicly about his prior testimony confirming that.So to recap, there were three “bombshells” in yesterday’s testimony. Two of them have been debunked and the third, that AR-15s were present in the crowd, has no evidence to back it and is so absurd and impossible as to be laughable. What a roaring success, right?But don’t be fooled. This is exactly what Liz Cheney and the rest of the dishonest hacks on the committee wanted. They don’t care that they put a liar under oath and had her repeat a bunch of easily disproven nonsense. The goal here was to garner headlines that will now become part of the collective psyche.
