One waiver was issued, but other members with conflicts were apparently waved through. This language is new. FDA is trying to CYA regardign conflicted committee members, about 8-10 of whom were specifically listed. FDA is also CYAing regarding its briefers, which I do not recall happening previously.Meryl Nass: John Beigel of NIH has been used to shoot down COVID treatments will be a briefer. So will Nicola Klein, who can't find a red flag --even if she found herself in the middle of a Russian parade.Meryl Nass: Peter Marks speaks now. In emails released by Epoch Times yesterday, it was hinted that he may have fired Marion Gruber and Philip Krause as they were standing up against the rapid issuance of the Comirnaty license.Meryl Nass: Oveta Fuller, who missed a fall meeting, has died.

The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party‚Äôs first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party‚Äôs first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party‚Äôs national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party‚Äôs Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‚Äòalternative‚Äô parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode‚Äôs running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle‚Äôs running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico &amp; especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti &amp; Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916.
