            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180¬∞ opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

The Moon's gravity allegedly generates something called \"tidal force\" which causes Earth and its water to bulge out, not only on the side closest to the Moon, but also the side farthest from the Moon.  Using their own calculations and predictions, however, if the Moon is only 2,160 miles in diameter and the Earth 8,000 miles, it follows that Earth is 87 times more massive and therefore the larger object should attract the smaller to it, and not the other way around.  Heliocentrists claim Earth's greater gravity is what keeps the Moon in orbit, therefore it is impossible for the Moon's far lesser gravity to supersede the Earth's gravity at Earth's sea-level, where its gravitational attraction would even further out-trump the Moon's.  If the Moon has enough attractive influence to lift the ocean's water even a single inch from their deep recesses where Earth's gravitational attraction is exponentially greater, then there is nothing in the theory of gravity to prevent the water from continuing its attraction all the way to the Moon.  Furthermore, the velocity and path of the Moon are uniform and thereby should exert a uniform influence on Earth's tides, when in actuality the Earth's tides vary greatly.  At Port Natal, for example, the rise and fall is only 6 feet, while at Beira 600 miles up the coast, the rise and fall is 26 feet.  Not only this, but if the Moon's gravity was truly generating a tidal force causing Earth and its water to bulge out, then all the world's lakes, marshes, ponds and other inland waters would be similarly affected and have tides as well.  These and other problems caused Isaac Newton to openly admit that his explanation of the tides was the \"least satisfactory\" portion of his theory of gravitation...<br /><br />Get Connected With Me:<br />Website: <a href=\"http://www.EricDubay.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>EricDubay.com<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Blog: <a href=\"http://www.AtlanteanConspiracy.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>AtlanteanConspiracy.com<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Forum: <a href=\"http://www.IFERS.123.st\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>IFERS.123.st<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Books: <a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Facebook: <a href=\"https://web.facebook.com/groups/edfes/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>web.facebook.com/groups/edfes/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ericdubaz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>instagram.com/ericdubaz/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericdubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>twitter.com/ericdubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Gettr: <a href=\"https://gettr.com/user/eric_dubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>gettr.com/user/eric_dubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />SoundCloud: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/eric-dubay/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>soundcloud.com/eric-dubay/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Mewe: <a href=\"https://mewe.com/i/ericdubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>mewe.com/i/ericdubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Minds: <a href=\"https://www.minds.com/EricDubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>minds.com/EricDubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Gab: <a href=\"https://gab.ai/Eric-Dubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>gab.ai/Eric-Dubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Goodreads: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/ericdubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>goodreads.com/ericdubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />YouTube: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/flateartheric\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>youtube.com/c/flateartheric<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Odysee: <a href=\"https://odysee.com/@EricDubay:c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>odysee.com/@EricDubay:c<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />BitChute: <a href=\"https://www.bitchute.com/channel/TCgwKoAf3Y9z/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>bitchute.com/channel/TCgwKoAf3Y9z/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Real Truthseekers: <a href=\"https://real-truth-seekers.com/@ericdubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>real-truth-seekers.com/@ericdubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Rokfin: <a href=\"https://rokfin.com/EricDubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>rokfin.com/EricDubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Rumble: <a href=\"https://rumble.com/c/c-1286253\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>rumble.com/c/c-1286253<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Dollar Vigilante: <a href=\"https://dollarvigilante.tv/c/eric.dubay/videos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>dollarvigilante.tv/c/eric.dubay/videos<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Telegram: <a href=\"http://t.me/flatearthericdubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>t.me/flatearthericdubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Email: ericdubaynewsletter@protonmail.com",

This guy is a rising star within our sphere. I know this is long, but worth it. Here's his channel: https://t.me/JamesADebatesPart I: \"I was recently made aware of Mike Peinovich and Eric Striker having a conversation about Estonia, and my positions. I'll post the clip that was sent to me below. As usual they made sure not to actually mention my name, although they did mention Greg Johnson, likely since he's already well known and I'm not. I find it interesting how they feel the need to reply to my arguments yet not acknowledge me. So far I have only made it to 3:45 or so and feel the need to respond, since they have made such glaringly incompetent pro-Kremlin arguments. I'll start off with Striker referring to Estonia as a skinny White punk in a violent prison. He, just like another TRS host before him, seeks to delegitimize Estonia's right to a sovereign and independent nation (Very, very White Nationalistic of you) by virtue of the fact that if Estonia and Russia went to war 1 vs 1, Estonia would lose. To that I say this. Estonia has kin and friends who would stand by us just as we stood by them. Estonians fought in the Finnish War of Independence, The Winter War, and The Continuation War. Finns also fought in the Estonian War of Independence. Estonians and Latvians fought side by side during our respective wars of independence, which in reality was one combined war not two separate ones, as I covered in a previous post. We have close relations with Finland, the Baltics, Poland, and Estonians are generally regarded very well across Eastern and Northern Europe. When we applied to NATO, no member vetoed our inclusion, which they could have done. So if Russia invaded Estonia, we would not have to fight alone, we would have kin and friends as willing to rush to our defence as we would be to theirs. Estonia has donated more military and financial aid to Ukraine than any other country when examined from a per-capita basis. During WW2 we fought valiantly for Europe, something Russia has never forgiven us for to this day. So we would not fight alone. Does this, having family and friends who would join us in preserving our independence from a foe we could not defeat alone, invalidate our right to a sovereign and independent nation on our historical, ancestral homeland, where we can speak our unique language, practice our unique culture, and pursue our unique destiny? Let me ask this question another way. There are tons of anti-fascists who would like to see Mike Peinovich dead. We have all seen Mike, I say this not to insult him, just like how you two did not wish to insult Estonians by referring to us, a people who have survived centuries of being in the middle of great powers, a people who survived being in the middle of The Great Northern War, The Northern Crusades, World War One, World War Two, and decades of Communist occupation to name just a few storms we have weathered, as a skinny punk, but Mike is overweight and has asthma. If he was attacked by a numerically superior gang of anti-fascists, if he was attacked by even just one of the many anti-fascists who still take militancy seriously, would he be able to defend himself, alone? Would he have to rely on his audience members being there to have his back?\"",

Both are now multi-billionaires who have claimed they support free speech. PayPal apparently no longer shares the principles of their founders. PayPal has flourished from customer online transactions and by means of drawing interest from balances. That‚Äôs not enough. PayPal wants more. Namely, power and control. This comes through tracking their customers and fin-ing them if they say things that PayPal finds objectionable.A $2,500 balance deduction is the fine for PayPal customers who spread ‚Äòmisinfor-mation‚Äô or what PayPal‚Äôs partner, the CFR run ADL[CFR 1% ruling elite deep state 5k in-ner circle member Jonathan A. Greenblatt CFR/CIA intel agent participating in psyop to make sexual deviancy a human right to help kill religion and free speech Chief Execu-tive Officer and National Director, ADL (Anti-Defamation League)] , calls ‚Äòhate speech.‚Äô What is ‚Äòmisinformation?‚Äô Anything the far left PayPal and ADL say it is. Perhaps PayPal was inspired to slip in such a fine after witnessing Trudeau shut down the bank ac-counts of the protesting Canadian truckers.We‚Äôve already had a similar experience with Patreon. They threatened to cancel our ac-count unless we removed all the cartoons (from our own website!) that criticized the Covid vaccines. They claimed that they had paid us a lot of money and therefore ‚Äòowned‚Äô us. It was a nonsensical bluff. Our fans used Patreon to support us and Patreon regularly extracted a large cut. We paid Patreon. They did not pay us a dime. We left that far-left organization by choice. Many are surprised PayPal hasn‚Äôt already pulled the plug on us, but maybe it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve brought so much business and money their way. Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that they would eventually fine us for spreading what they call ‚Äòmisinformation.‚ÄôAfter an outpouring of outrage, PayPal backtracked and claimed their policy to control free speech was a mistake! That‚Äôs a howler. Obviously PayPal has a legion of lawyers to look over their policy with a fine-tooth comb. PayPal is not sorry. They‚Äôre sorry they got caught. Maybe they never expected someone to actually read the updated fine print.Fight Thought Control through supporting Grrrgraphics high impact cartoons- We draw for you!

Both are now multi-billionaires who have claimed they support free speech. PayPal apparently no longer shares the principles of their founders. PayPal has flourished from customer online transactions and by means of drawing interest from balances. That‚Äôs not enough. PayPal wants more. Namely, power and control. This comes through tracking their customers and fin-ing them if they say things that PayPal finds objectionable.<br /><br />A $2,500 balance deduction is the fine for PayPal customers who spread ‚Äòmisinfor-mation‚Äô or what PayPal‚Äôs partner, the CFR run ADL[CFR 1% ruling elite deep state 5k in-ner circle member Jonathan A. Greenblatt CFR/CIA intel agent participating in psyop to make sexual deviancy a human right to help kill religion and free speech Chief Execu-tive Officer and National Director, ADL (Anti-Defamation League)] , calls ‚Äòhate speech.‚Äô What is ‚Äòmisinformation?‚Äô Anything the far left PayPal and ADL say it is. Perhaps PayPal was inspired to slip in such a fine after witnessing Trudeau shut down the bank ac-counts of the protesting Canadian truckers.<br /><br />We‚Äôve already had a similar experience with Patreon. They threatened to cancel our ac-count unless we removed all the cartoons (from our own website!) that criticized the Covid vaccines. They claimed that they had paid us a lot of money and therefore ‚Äòowned‚Äô us. It was a nonsensical bluff. Our fans used Patreon to support us and Patreon regularly extracted a large cut. We paid Patreon. They did not pay us a dime. We left that far-left organization by choice. Many are surprised PayPal hasn‚Äôt already pulled the plug on us, but maybe it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve brought so much business and money their way. Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that they would eventually fine us for spreading what they call ‚Äòmisinformation.‚Äô<br /><br />After an outpouring of outrage, PayPal backtracked and claimed their policy to control free speech was a mistake! That‚Äôs a howler. Obviously PayPal has a legion of lawyers to look over their policy with a fine-tooth comb. PayPal is not sorry. They‚Äôre sorry they got caught. Maybe they never expected someone to actually read the updated fine print.<br /><br />Fight Thought Control through supporting Grrrgraphics high impact cartoons- We draw for you!

Both are now multi-billionaires who have claimed they support free speech. PayPal apparently no longer shares the principles of their founders. PayPal has flourished from customer online transactions and by means of drawing interest from balances. That‚Äôs not enough. PayPal wants more. Namely, power and control. This comes through tracking their customers and fin-ing them if they say things that PayPal finds objectionable.A $2,500 balance deduction is the fine for PayPal customers who spread ‚Äòmisinfor-mation‚Äô or what PayPal‚Äôs partner, the CFR run ADL[CFR 1% ruling elite deep state 5k in-ner circle member Jonathan A.

Perhaps PayPal was inspired to slip in such a fine after witnessing Trudeau shut down the bank ac-counts of the protesting Canadian truckers.We‚Äôve already had a similar experience with Patreon. They threatened to cancel our ac-count unless we removed all the cartoons (from our own website!) that criticized the Covid vaccines. They claimed that they had paid us a lot of money and therefore ‚Äòowned‚Äô us. It was a nonsensical bluff. Our fans used Patreon to support us and Patreon regularly extracted a large cut. We paid Patreon. They did not pay us a dime. We left that far-left organization by choice. Many are surprised PayPal hasn‚Äôt already pulled the plug on us, but maybe it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve brought so much business and money their way. Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that they would eventually fine us for spreading what they call ‚Äòmisinformation.‚ÄôAfter an outpouring of outrage, PayPal backtracked and claimed their policy to control free speech was a mistake! That‚Äôs a howler. Obviously PayPal has a legion of lawyers to look over their policy with a fine-tooth comb. PayPal is not sorry. They‚Äôre sorry they got caught.

Both are now multi-billionaires who have claimed they support free speech. PayPal apparently no longer shares the principles of their founders. PayPal has flourished from customer online transactions and by means of drawing interest from balances. That‚Äôs not enough. PayPal wants more. Namely, power and control. This comes through tracking their customers and fin-ing them if they say things that PayPal finds objectionable.<br /><br />A $2,500 balance deduction is the fine for PayPal customers who spread ‚Äòmisinfor-mation‚Äô or what PayPal‚Äôs partner, the CFR run ADL[CFR 1% ruling elite deep state 5k in-ner circle member Jonathan A. Greenblatt CFR/CIA intel agent participating in psyop to make sexual deviancy a human right to help kill religion and free speech Chief Execu-tive Officer and National Director, ADL (Anti-Defamation League)] , calls ‚Äòhate speech.‚Äô What is ‚Äòmisinformation?‚Äô Anything the far left PayPal and ADL say it is. Perhaps PayPal was inspired to slip in such a fine after witnessing Trudeau shut down the bank ac-counts of the protesting Canadian truckers.<br /><br />We‚Äôve already had a similar experience with Patreon. They threatened to cancel our ac-count unless we removed all the cartoons (from our own website!) that criticized the Covid vaccines. They claimed that they had paid us a lot of money and therefore ‚Äòowned‚Äô us. It was a nonsensical bluff. Our fans used Patreon to support us and Patreon regularly extracted a large cut. We paid Patreon. They did not pay us a dime. We left that far-left organization by choice. Many are surprised PayPal hasn‚Äôt already pulled the plug on us, but maybe it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve brought so much business and money their way. Still, it‚Äôs probably inevitable that they would eventually fine us for spreading what they call ‚Äòmisinformation.‚Äô<br /><br />After an outpouring of outrage, PayPal backtracked and claimed their policy to control free speech was a mistake! That‚Äôs a howler. Obviously PayPal has a legion of lawyers to look over their policy with a fine-tooth comb. PayPal is not sorry. They‚Äôre sorry they got caught. Maybe they never expected someone to actually read the updated fine print.<br /><br />Fight Thought Control through supporting Grrrgraphics high impact cartoons- We draw for you!
