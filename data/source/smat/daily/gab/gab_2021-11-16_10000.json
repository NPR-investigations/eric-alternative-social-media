You can't blame NASA photos either since we've known its correct shape for 100s of years before NASA by ground mapping alone. Ships and planes have used its real shape for 100s of years to navigate.

So how and why was so much power given to them? Well we know why nothing happens and why they have this power,  and that is George Soros, and Obama and the standing idiot POTUS. and they won't waste an opertunity especially a well planed one, civil unrest is what they want , fighting each other instead of the ones poking the bear , the goal is the UN and FEMA armies. do any of you recall Operation Maple Leaf (Can.) and Jade Helm (USA).that never went away it was for now and what is coming, lets hope that society snaps out of the trance it is under , when people add it up that more loved ones are dying from the jab (and the Variant it carries) than were dying from Covid 19 , perhaps then the lights will come on",

            "description": "by WorldTribune Staff, October 13, 2021\r\n\r\nIn a Sept. 23 deposition, Eric Coomer, the former director of security and product strategy for Dominion Voting Systems, said that Dominion shared his extreme leftist beliefs and that he only screwed up because he allowed the political right to make him the perfect villain.\r\n\r\nCoomer has filed lawsuits against 15 organizations and people, including attorney Sidney Powell and former Tech CEO Joe Oltmann, for defamation in his home state of Colorado.\r\n\r\n[caption id=attachment_100640 align=alignleft width=411] Eric Coomer[/caption]\r\n\r\nThat expensive legal offensive has had the effect of deterring and silencing minority conservative media reporting on the evidence of not only mail-in ballot irregularities but the poorly-understood role of Internet-connected election equipment and software in the tabulation and adjudication of voting data.\r\n\r\nCoomer claims to have been defamed by journalists who allegedly said he was tied to Antifa, and that he helped rig the 2020 election against President Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nHe became known to the world courtesy of Oltmann's investigation of Antifa as detailed in his interview with WorldTribune columnist Michele Malkin.\r\n\r\nRelated: Who is Eric Coomer of Dominion Voting Systems?, November 17, 2020\r\n\r\nThe deposition reveals Coomer had lied in a Dec. 8, 2020 op-ed he authored in the Denver Post when he stated that he did not have any social media accounts, and that any Facebook posts attributed to him that were circulating throughout the public were “fabricated,” pretending to be him, but not authored by him.\r\n\r\n“I want to be very clear: I have no connection to the Antifa movement, I did not 'rig,' or influence the election, nor have I participated in any calls, demonstrations, or other demonstrable activity related to any political party or social justice/action group. Additionally, any posts on social media channels purporting to be from me have also been fabricated. I do not have a Twitter account and my Facebook account is not active. These individuals are impersonating me,” Coomer wrote.\r\n\r\nPowell’s lawyer Barry Arrington was able to get Coomer to admit that he had, indeed, written Facebook messages prior to the 2020 presidential election which Coomer had denied writing.\r\n\r\nCoomer's Facebook posts included:\r\n\r\n“If you are planning to vote for that autocratic, narcissistic fascist asshat blowhard and his Christian jihadist VP pic, UNFRIEND ME NOW!”\r\n\r\n“Only an absolute F—-ING IDIOT could ever vote for that wind-bag, f—tard FASCIST RACIST F—! No bull—-, I don’t give a damn if you’re a friend, family or random acquaintance, pull the level, mark an oval, touch a screen for that carnival barker… UNFRIEND ME NOW.”\r\n\r\nCoomer then qualified his long-rant against Trump by saying this about Dominion:\r\n\r\n“…these opinions are rational, and completely my own. They are based in reason and highly credible. Though they are not necessarily the thoughts of my employer, though if not, I should probably find another job… Who wants to work for completely morons?”\r\n\r\nThe Gateway Pundit, one of the organizations sued by Coomer, noted that he was head of Product Strategy and Security for voting systems in 28 presidential election states in 2020, including every swing state, and yet was publicly posting vicious anti-Trump screeds, including the nastiest comments possible against Trump voters whom he called fascists.\r\n\r\nOltmann wrote in a Telegram post: Get excited about what is happening because we are winning. Dominion will soon be done, Biden will be removed and the radical left will be destroyed. Count on it.\r\n\r\nHere is the portion of the deposition where Coomer contends Dominion agrees with his leftist views:\r\n\r\n!function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src=https://rumble.com/embedJS/u4+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+/?url=+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+&args=+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, script, Rumble);\r\n\r\n\r\nRumble(play, {video:vl0mrx,div:rumble_vl0mrx});\r\n\r\n\r\n INFORMATION WORLD WAR:  How We Win . . . .

The report said the deal is expected to conclude in early 2022.<br /><br />The decision to go with the Waldorf Astoria was allegedly part of moving the building away from politics. During the Trump administration, the hotel was a hot spot for Republicans.<br /><br />&gt;&gt;“If it becomes affiliated with a luxury brand, that brand can create a new identity for the property,” said Sean Hennessey, chief executive of Lodging Advisors.",

There is one system of justice for democrats and the left and another for Republicans and the right.  Serious weaponization of the Justice Department took hold under the Obama regime but has gotten completely out of control. One manifestation can easily be seen in the Steve Bannon saga.Bannon was indicted for contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena.Stephen K. strong> Bannon was indicted today by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress stemming from his failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol.Bannon faces up to two years in jail and fines of $2000. The potential lengthy incarceration seems out of balance with the relatively low fine. That's not the only thing out of balance. There are previous instances which have gone in a very different direction.Lois Lerner (D) admitted using the IRS to target conservatives.  She was found in Contempt of Congress when she defied a subpoena from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Was she indicted? No.The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has notified House Speaker John Boehner that it won’t bring contempt of Congress charges against Lois Lerner, former Internal Revenue Service official who asserted her right to decline to answer questions during a congressional hearing.You might remember the name Eric Holder (D). He was held in Contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over requested documents about the Fast and Furious debacle. His fate? Nothing. A Federal judge refused to indict him.The Republican Bannon? No such luck.

          "contentraw": "The \"Justice\" system is now entirely perverted<br />Flopping Aces ^ | 09-14-21 | DrJohn<br /><a href=\"https://www.floppingaces.net/2021/11/14/the-justice-system-is-now-entirely-perverted/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>floppingaces.net/2021/11/14/the-justice-syste<span class=\"invisible\">m-is-now-entirely-perverted/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Biden regime has fully weaponized the entire justice system and it is a growing malignancy. There is one system of justice for democrats and the left and another for Republicans and the right.  Serious weaponization of the Justice Department took hold under the Obama regime but has gotten completely out of control. One manifestation can easily be seen in the Steve Bannon saga.<br /><br />Bannon was indicted for contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena.<br /><br />Stephen K. strong&gt; Bannon was indicted today by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress stemming from his failure to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol.<br /><br />Bannon faces up to two years in jail and fines of $2000. The potential lengthy incarceration seems out of balance with the relatively low fine. That's not the only thing out of balance. There are previous instances which have gone in a very different direction.<br /><br />Lois Lerner (D) admitted using the IRS to target conservatives.  She was found in Contempt of Congress when she defied a subpoena from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Was she indicted? No.<br /><br />The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has notified House Speaker John Boehner that it won’t bring contempt of Congress charges against Lois Lerner, former Internal Revenue Service official who asserted her right to decline to answer questions during a congressional hearing.<br /><br />You might remember the name Eric Holder (D). He was held in Contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over requested documents about the Fast and Furious debacle. His fate? Nothing. A Federal judge refused to indict him.<br /><br />The Republican Bannon? No such luck. After all, he was a friend of Trump.<br /><br />A great number of non-violent protesters and even some who never entered the Capitol on Jan 6 were put into solitary confinement and denied both due process and a right to a speedy trial.<br /><br />The FBI has been completely corrupted.<br /><br />The FBI sat on evidence about Jeffrey Epstein.<br /><br />What did the Justice Department have on Epstein?
