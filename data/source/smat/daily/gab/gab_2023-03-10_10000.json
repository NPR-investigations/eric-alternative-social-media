            "description": "This article discusses the decision made by Florida's Secretary of State Cord Byrd to withdraw the state from the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC). ERIC is an NGO that gathers voter information, and according to the article, the system is biased and supports the liberal side of all registration questions. Byrd stated that he had an obligation to protect the personal information of Florida's citizens, which the ERIC agreement required them to share. The article suggests that ERIC could potentially sell private identification information to interested political entities, and that the number of ineligible or inactive voters has not been verified to the Department of State's liking.",

And this governor is not doing that in Texas. But we are going to set the right tone of being here for these families.”That was in August of last year. Adams has now changed his tune and decided not to welcome any more illegals — despite constantly bragging about New York being a “sanctuary city.”Washington Examiner:New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, announced that the city will be relocating illegal immigrants across the country after months of complaints that the city’s resources were being strained. The policy briefing that details Adams’s plan claims that “as of March 2023, there were 79,937 people in shelter placement in New York City. … This is due in large part to the influx of newcomers. Our shelter system is full, and we are running out of funds, staff, and space.”Therefore, New York City will now start busing illegal immigrants to other areas of the country. It’s a far cry from Adams’s sanctimonious campaign statements. According to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and other left-wing activists, it may even be “trafficking.”New York City Mayor Eric Adamshttps://gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748Contact:http://ericadams2021.comhttps://www.facebook.com/80559174013https://www.instagram.com/ericadamsfornycPeople in PoliticsPage 1 https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087",

Before her time working with the commission, she acted as the Chief of Staff and Interim Director for the Indiana State Personnel Department.\n\nThe Indiana Regulatory Commission Nominating Committee will convene to evaluate candidates to fill the position after her departure. They will then submit the nominations of three individuals to the governor, and he will decide who will fill the vacated position. Former IURC chair woman Carol Stephan serves as the chair of the nominating committee.\n\nThe application and deadline information are available HERE.\n\n-30-",

No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father). Seventh Day Adventism is probably the creepiest cult out there. All of the others are blatant fakes but SDA merely “blends in like another denomination” (whatever a “denomination” is...).It’s not even REMOTELY close, actually. The list is long. That’s tragic, actually. Forever’s a long time.By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots.

It’s more accurate and allowing Him to live in you is more feasible than merely trying to imitate behavior(s).Jesus did 100% of everything salvation-wise. By comparison, a human can do 100% of nothing (see John 15:5 – “Nothing” means “Nothing”, as in 0% of ANYTHING).(SIDE NOTE - The term “Christ” is a title, not a name.
