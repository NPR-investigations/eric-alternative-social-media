Il fallait quelque chose qui déclenche l’union générale c’est l’opportunité de refuser de voter pour des criminels. Tous ces petits candidats qui dénoncent et ont été écartés de la sélection feront partie de ce gouvernement provisoire. Le peuple français est-il prêt aujourd’hui à accepter cette triche complète et à voter pour ceux qui vont encore plus les trahir ? Si vous savez que votre vote ne sert strictement à rien parce que les dés sont déjà pipés iriez-vous voter ?Aujourd’hui la logique, le juste droit et l’application du droit français exige que ces élections soient annulées et repoussées. Les prétendants actuels sont clairement des usurpateurs de fonction et n’auraient pas le droit normalement d’être là. Les prétendants usurpateurs de fonction doivent laisser la place à un Gouvernement Provisoire qui organisera de vraies élections.SOURCE : Mohamed Kherchouche",

          "content": "FYIhttps://archive.is/oEmbt – “The Gun Lobby’s Jewish Enemies List””The National Rifle Association compiled a list of its enemies and it reads like a Jewish who’s who list. The list, prepared by the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action includes 506 individuals, organizations, media outlets and corporations that “have lent monetary, grassroots or some other type of direct support to anti-gun organizations.”The groups listed by the NRA as enemies of the gun-rights cause could easily populate a Conference of Presidents meeting room. They include major Jewish national organizations, including the Anti Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, B’nai B’rith, and the Jewish Labor Committee; two major Jewish women organizations: Hadassah and National Council of Jewish Women; and the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which is the Reform movement’s rabbinical arm.Reform Jews, the list suggests, are among the NRA’s worst adversaries. The list includes not only their national rabbinical group but also names specifically the Union for Reform Judaism’s former president Eric Yoffie and David Saperstein, director of the group’s Religious Action Center, as individuals fighting for gun control laws.",
