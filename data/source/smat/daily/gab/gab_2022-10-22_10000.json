He added that the two Republican-led states ‚Äúhave proven that Dr. Fauci has personal knowledge about the issue concerning censorship across social media as it related to Covid-19,‚Äù ordering him to cooperate with a deposition.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Fauci actually had personal reasons to want censorship, given that he was involved in the crooked funding of crooked experiments, and personally getting seriously paid.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Jen Easterly, who heads up the DHS‚Äôs Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was also ordered to testify. She played a ‚Äúcentral role‚Äù in ‚Äúflagging misinformation to social-media companies for censorship,‚Äù the plaintiffs argued, describing the cyber agency the ‚Äúnerve center‚Äù of ‚Äúthe federal government‚Äôs efforts to censor social media users.‚Äù[T]he lawsuit claims the federal government encouraged online platforms to censor, delete or ban certain speech about the pandemic, including discussion of the ‚Äúlab leak theory of Covid-19‚Äôs origin,‚Äù as well as questions about the effectiveness of face masks, vaccines or lockdown policies, among other issues.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------The censorship did become illegal, exiting the dumb ideological world of ‚Äúa private company can do anything it wants to anyone,‚Äù when the government started telling social media companies to censor and what to censor. They‚Äôre not allowed to do that.This was ultimately not about the ‚Äúlab leak theory,‚Äù which is itself a hoax to cover up the truth.
