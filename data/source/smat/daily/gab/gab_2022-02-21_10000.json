It showed that people can become so complacent they forget to appreciate and in doing so, become selfish. A parent would know this well I think. I always liked this quote:\"People who bite the hand that feeds them usually lick the boot that kicks them\" ~ (attributed to Eric Hoffer.' I didn't get a chance to check if it's a fact as some of these are altered or the said author never said it) but I'm covering both sides. I find the quote itself a truth...which suddenly reminds me of your salient point regarding 'greed' in respect to love in our discussion. I must get back to that. I trust you are well my friend.. 🧡",

A traffic jam held up several of the performers and Havens, who was slated as the fifth act, was urged on stage (along with his band: Eric Oxendine on bass, Paul Williams on lead guitar, and Daniel Ben Zebulon on congas). Three hours later, he ran out of songs and created the enduring anthem on the spot. \"When you hear me play that long intro, it's me stalling. I was thinking, 'What the hell am I going to sing?'\" he explained. \"I think the word 'freedom' came out of my mouth because I saw it in front of me. I saw the freedom that we were looking for. And every person was sharing it, and so that word came out.\"\"'Freedom' has become the anthem of youth wherever I go,\" Havens told DISCoveries magazine in 1994. \"But I'll sing it for the rest of my life, if only to show the rest of the world what I think an American is. Sometimes I think we don't know ourselves...\"https://www.songfacts.com/facts/richie-havens/freedom",

She stated, “The history of Canadian settler colonialism and public health demonstrates how both overt white-supremacist claims and seemingly more inert nationalistic claims about ‘unity’ and ‘freedom’ both enable and erase ongoing harm to marginalized communities.” Huh?She added, “The primarily White supporters of the Freedom Convoy argue that pandemic mandates infringe upon their constitutional rights to freedom. The notion of ‘freedom’ was historically and remains intertwined with Whiteness, as historian Tyler Stovall has argued. The belief that one’s entitlement to freedom is a key component of White supremacy. This explains why the Freedom Convoy members see themselves as entitled to freedom, no matter the public health consequences to those around them.”Yes, how dare the Freedom Convoy members think they are “entitled” to freedom! It’s not like they have inalienable rights granted by their Creator or something! They only have the rights that the government says they have…or don’t have! Period. Leftists somehow believe they are entitled to determine what freedom other people have. Revolting assumed privilege.",

The notion of ‘freedom’ was historically and remains intertwined with Whiteness, as historian Tyler Stovall has argued. The belief that one’s entitlement to freedom is a key component of White supremacy. This explains why the Freedom Convoy members see themselves as entitled to freedom, no matter the public health consequences to those around them.”<br /><br />Yes, how dare the Freedom Convoy members think they are “entitled” to freedom! It’s not like they have inalienable rights granted by their Creator or something! They only have the rights that the government says they have…or don’t have! Period. Leftists somehow believe they are entitled to determine what freedom other people have. Revolting assumed privilege.",
