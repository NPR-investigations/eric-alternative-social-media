After reading about these allegations and speaking with election attorneys and experts, I have determined that it may no longer be in Louisiana’s best interests to participate in this organization,” Secretary Ardoin said. “Itis vital that any legitimate allegation of voter fraud or possible misuse of our voters’ personal information is investigated. My job is to ensure that the data voters entrust to my office is protected. I look forward to ERIC’s swift response to these allegations.”<br /><br />ERIC was founded in 2012 by seven states, including Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Nevada, Utah,Virginia, Washington and the Pew Charitable Trusts.

After reading about these allegations and speaking with election attorneys and experts, I have determined that it may no longer be in Louisiana’s best interests to participate in this organization,” Secretary Ardoin said. “Itis vital that any legitimate allegation of voter fraud or possible misuse of our voters’ personal information is investigated. My job is to ensure that the data voters entrust to my office is protected. I look forward to ERIC’s swift response to these allegations.”ERIC was founded in 2012 by seven states, including Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Nevada, Utah,Virginia, Washington and the Pew Charitable Trusts.

My job is to ensure that the data voters entrust to my office is protected.

La faute à une nomination invraisemblable: celle de son propre frère, Bernard Adams, en tant que numéro deux du NYPD, le New York Police Department. Pour un gérant de parking en Virginie, la promotion est indéfendable. Elle est prestement retirée, étouffant les accusations de népotisme. Adams, avec son bagout, ses tenues élégantes et son «swagger» (classe naturelle) auto-revendiqué, s’en sort bien.Depuis le 1er janvier, jour de l’investiture d’Eric Adams, on compte cinq policiers touchés par balle, dont deux mortellement. Certes, en 2021, la ville n’a enregistré que 488 homicides, contre 2262 en 1990, et la hausse continue depuis 2018 ne s’approche en rien des décennies terribles (1970-1990), mais la tendance générale est inquiétante. Accablé par cette série noire, le successeur de Bill de Blasio à la mairie de New York se démène. À 61 ans, le vétéran du NYPD fonce sur chaque scène de crime, comme s’il était redevenu le «beat cop» (flic de rue) de jadis.Une autre question taraude Eric Adams: que tant de ses pairs en uniforme, parmi les 35.000 membres du NYPD, vivent en dehors de New York City, dans les comtés voisins de Nassau, Westchester, Suffolk, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, à une ou deux heures de voiture de leur commissariat. Les syndicats de policiers, ont aussitôt réagi: avec un salaire de départ de 42.500 dollars par an (37.600 euros), il est impossible de survivre dans la ville la plus chère du pays (et la sixième du monde).",

Pour un gérant de parking en Virginie, la promotion est indéfendable. Elle est prestement retirée, étouffant les accusations de népotisme. Adams, avec son bagout, ses tenues élégantes et son «swagger» (classe naturelle) auto-revendiqué, s’en sort bien.<br /><br />Depuis le 1er janvier, jour de l’investiture d’Eric Adams, on compte cinq policiers touchés par balle, dont deux mortellement. Certes, en 2021, la ville n’a enregistré que 488 homicides, contre 2262 en 1990, et la hausse continue depuis 2018 ne s’approche en rien des décennies terribles (1970-1990), mais la tendance générale est inquiétante. Accablé par cette série noire, le successeur de Bill de Blasio à la mairie de New York se démène. À 61 ans, le vétéran du NYPD fonce sur chaque scène de crime, comme s’il était redevenu le «beat cop» (flic de rue) de jadis.<br /><br />Une autre question taraude Eric Adams: que tant de ses pairs en uniforme, parmi les 35.000 membres du NYPD, vivent en dehors de New York City, dans les comtés voisins de Nassau, Westchester, Suffolk, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, à une ou deux heures de voiture de leur commissariat. <br /><br />Les syndicats de policiers, ont aussitôt réagi: avec un salaire de départ de 42.500 dollars par an (37.600 euros), il est impossible de survivre dans la ville la plus chère du pays (et la sixième du monde).",

A bill will be tabled at the beginning of the parliamentary session, the last one before the general election on October 3.<br /><br />It is possible that Finance Minister Eric Girard will introduce the legislation as early as next week, when the MNAs resume sitting in the National Assembly on Tuesday.<br /><br />To prepare for the session, the Caquist MNAs met in virtual caucus on Thursday and Friday. However, Premier François Legault did not hold a press conference for the occasion, which is exceptional. \"We will contact you if there is media availability,\" we warned at the beginning of the week. There was no availability. However, the House Leader Simon Jolin-Barrette offered to give interviews.<br /><br />\"Our priority for this session is health,\" he told La Presse on Friday, after the caucus meeting.<br /><br />Health and Social Services Minister Christian Dubé will present his plan to \"refound\" the health system. Part of the plan is already known: two bills were tabled last fall. One aims to increase access to family doctors, the other to improve access to health data. Consultations will be held starting next week with a view to adopting them.<br /><br />Christian Dubé will introduce another piece of legislation with the goal of eventually ending the state of health emergency while maintaining measures that have been enacted since the beginning of the pandemic and that are deemed essential for the future.<br /><br />The issue of the tax for the non-vaccinated is the responsibility of Eric Girard. His bill could be introduced as early as next week.<br /><br />This \"health contribution\" will be modulated according to income. We are talking about an amount ranging from $100 to about $800. On Friday, the minister's office would neither deny nor confirm the information gathered over the past few days.<br /><br />The tax would be imposed starting with the tax return for the year 2021. It would be payable upon receipt of the notice of assessment, i.e. after the return has been sent and processed.<br /><br />Legislation is needed to allow the tax authorities to obtain information on the vaccination status of each taxpayer and to target non-vaccinated individuals.<br /><br />The government's objective is to encourage those who are reluctant to roll up their sleeves and - it's no secret - to respond to popular discontent towards the non-vaccinated.<br />[...]<br /><a href=\"https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/2022-01-29/non-vaccines/une-taxe-de-100-a-800-selon-le-revenu.php?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/2022-01-29/n<span class=\"invisible\">on-vaccines/une-taxe-de-100-a-800-selon-le-revenu.php?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

The National Weather Service in Boston reported lightning strikes off the North Carolina coast and curvature to the cloud shield, indicating storm intensification.<br /><br />Flurries had been affecting the New York Metropolitan Area all Friday but the flakes began to stick at around 8 p.m. Friday evening as Winter Storm Kenan arrived. <br /><br />All of the East Coast is preparing for blizzard-like conditions with strong winds, up to two feet of snow and flooding with 10 states under blizzard warnings. <br /><br />The East Coast is expecting winds 'as powerful as the strongest hurricane' and Bostonians could witness record snowfall as the extreme weather arriving Friday night will impact 75 million people from the Southeast up the coast to New England. <br /><br />While most were hunkered indoors for the heavy snowfall and winds, some were still trying to walk their dogs and do some last minute shopping for supplies. <br /><br />New York City Mayor Eric Adams has warned New Yorkers not to travel and canceled outdoor dining and vaccine appointments on Saturday ahead of the powerful Nor'easter. <br /><br />Meanwhile, in neighboring New Jersey, NJ Transit suspended all bus service at the start of the service day on Saturday, with plans to resume service once it is safe to do so, with transit officials saying they're anticipating bringing back buses 'later in the day' on Saturday.  <br /><br />Boston's Logan Airport has canceled most of its flights as the city braces for the worst snowstorm in its history to hit, as all the East Coast prepares for blizzard-like conditions, including up to two feet of snow and flooding in some areas.  <br /><br />Across the country, 2,252 flights were cancelled on Friday with 3,410 flights already cancelled for Saturday, according to FlightAware.",
