Biden, Inc. weathered the November elections magnificently with minimal losses and, in fact, picked up seats in the Senate and in state offices. An overrun southern border, an inflated economy, rampant urban violence, a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden’s family scandals—none of these apparent disasters seemed to matter as much as our president’s promise to remit college debts for young voters and the reaction of unmarried women to the&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;decision. Of course, an obvious reason for these developments was the way the Democrats sent out their mail-in ballot many weeks in advance to designated voters to react to events that their media lackeys played up at the designated times.But my point is not to rehash the games that the Democrats play with ballots and voter rolls. It is to underscore the precarious position that their official opposition is now facing and the need to mobilize all resources to hold back a tsunami of initiatives from the Left, all of which will be dutifully trumpeted by the press and an obliging Senate. Significantly, even as the Democrats were vacating majority control of Congress, which they only lost by a handful of seats, they managed with RINO support to pass an omnibus spending bill that will tie the hands of the small Republican majority on budgetary matters for the next year.In light of the truly desperate position that opposition to America’s woke ruling class must now confront, one might think that the non-Left would do everything possible to survive as a check on a very aggressive enemy. But guess again! The desire to virtue signal even at the cost of accepting the Left’s double standard may be too great to resist. Allow me to admit that I’m appalled, despite my low regard for these ranting moralists, to hear their shock at the fibs that were told by the newly elected congressman from New York’s 3rd district. I am not a fan of George Santos and find his mendacity a bit distasteful. But I fully understand, as&nbsp;Roger Kimball,&nbsp;Victor Davis Hanson, and scores of&nbsp;other columnists&nbsp;have pointed out, that Santos cannot reach the toenails of his Democratic opponents in the matter of bending truth for political gain.Where do you begin to recount the lies of Democratic politicians, which the media happily bury or reconstruct? Should we start with liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) making a professional career as a law professor at Harvard out of her outrageously fake Native American ancestry? What about another leftist Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, campaigning as a bogus Vietnam veteran, or Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) lying even to&nbsp;this day&nbsp;about Donald Trump’s “Russian collusion,” or Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) hiding an affair with a Chinese spy? We won’t even get into Joe Biden’s ludicrous claims to Jewish, Puerto Rican, and possibly black ancestry, his assertions about fighting alongside Nelson Mandela against Apartheid in South Africa, and his blatant untruths about not being involved in his son’s “business deals” with the Chinese Communist Party.Read morehttps://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/01/paul-gottfried/santos-cant-touch-the-democrats-duplicity/",
