            "description": "This group is to be used to form a new caucus called the True Republican United Maga Party (TRUMP) within all current political parties, as a sort of party within a party, acting as leaven: \"Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.\" (Matthew 13:33.) A caucus is \"a closed meeting of a group of persons belonging to the same political party or faction usually to select candidates or to decide on policy;\" also, \"a group of people united to promote an agreed-upon cause.\" Creating TRUMP caucuses would by-pass the legalities, expense and time needed to create a third party. It would be the fastest, most effective (since it would penetrate all parties) and least expensive way to compete against and defeat the traitorous Rinos of the Republican Party and the treasonous Democrats of the Democratic Party, which together comprise that diabolical conglomerate known as the Socially Woke American Marxist Party (SWAMP). Those who voted for Trump (Trumpers) can register with the political party of their choice, but to join these caucuses and become a card-carrying TRUMPer, they would need to fill out yet another registration form and agree to whatever the TRUMP platform is. By uniting people, talents and resources under one newly-created, common, political banner (TRUMP), both money and people will be siphoned off of the SWAMP---thus draining it---which would, in particular, completely gut and financially destroy the SWAMP Rinos. Once established as local, state and national TRUMPs, each TRUMP would have ELECTION INTEGRITY as its first and most important party platform principle, for without election integrity, all voting is in vain. (As a platform principle, TRUMPers would NOT vote in areas where there is no election integrity.) In every area where election integrity is established, TRUMP candidates would be put on the ballot. If any TRUMP really wants to effect radical and rapid change, then in every area where there is no election integrity it could establish the \"no taxation without representation\" principle as part of its platform and promote and support TAX REVOLTS until election integrity has been established. These and all other platform principles would be decided by the TRUMPers themselves, as they organize themselves around America First Trumpism, defining it as they see fit. If this is something you'd like to see happen, freely join this group and help to organize caucus committees throughout the land and establish this as, essentially, a 70 to 100 million strong third party that the governing elite will have to deal with.",

In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water‚Äôs Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‚Äòpolitical activism‚Äô, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used ‚Äúimagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money‚Äù and had ‚Äúcrossed the line into anti-Semitism‚Äù allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was ‚Äúrepresentative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently‚Äù, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. -- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Born to Mary (n√©e Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey, his father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, and a Communist Party member. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd and subsequently composed and recorded a series of politically charged and aggressive albums including The Wall. In fact the accompanying video to the featured single The Wall is cunningly interspersed with references to the Holocaust construct indicating Water‚Äôs Communist affiliation. The 1982 film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album whose screenplay was written by Waters also features heavily politicised scenes that deliberately manifest the totalitarianism of Bolshevism but overlaid with fascist iconography. In October 2010 his ‚Äòpolitical activism‚Äô, a contrived performance for the press, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Waters, saying that he had used ‚Äúimagery long associated with stereotypes about Jews and money‚Äù and had ‚Äúcrossed the line into anti-Semitism‚Äù allowing Waters to show his veneration for his Jewish masters and affirm his advocacy for their global domination. In particular in his open letter to The Independent he stated that the artwork used during his shows was ‚Äúrepresentative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently‚Äù, exquisitely representing the rhetoric of the politically correct Global Jewish Zionists destroying race and culture. ------------- https://www.goyimtv.tv/v/3186041359/Roger-Waters-is-a-Marxist",

Even NYC Mayor Eric Adams and other Mayor‚Äôs where illegals are being dropped off are complaining about no resources to validate identification and vaccine status, etc.My point is, Canadians who are our closest friends are being punished by an unreasonable mandate.

All the Nazi groups are socialist, the \"white Protection league\" is run by a fucking kike, and the \"Politically Incorrect,\" group is politically correct. Leftism is the denial and projection of denial and projection.I will troll all enemies of the white race into submission. White Power means I am not obligated to let migrants live in a tent on my front lawn and a kike on the couch in my livingroom. Build your own lives, stop leeching off mine like a bunch of parasites.Access to Whites is not a right; it is a matter of our own volition, a priviledge that We have the right to withdraw at any time, for whatever reason we deem fit.\"as Judeo-Christians, we should let the Jews who killed Christ run our governments because that's what the bible says.\" - Moron Fake Christians\"Having thoughts and opinions is bigoted\" - leftists\"we need to erase the speech and thoughts some people have to stop all the bigotry.\" - #BigtechThe Left = The Jews and their useful idiots. Notice how the Left bitches about Whites all day long, but when whites say \"Ok, fine, lets live in separate states,\" they then say that that notion is somehow the most evil, racist thing ever. They don't have the intellectual capacity or consistency to say... \"ok, let's just go our separate ways\" because they know they are pathetic, dumb, lazy cunts that are utterly dependent on us to stay alive.For now on, the first two screener questions you should ask a #Republican candidate are: 1. Do you love the Jews?2. Should men have sex with men?A yes to either is a no-go.I like to call leftist ideology \"Intersectional Communism\", because that's what it is.Communism is a publically known and announced Jewish world takeover conspiracy plot that has already killed hundreds of millions of people, but if you say so, you're anti-semetic, even though Jews are less than half semetic. Arabs are semetic. To kikes, a statement of the publically known _truth_ is \"hate speech\".Enemies of mankind...",

The Insider Advantage poll, sponsored by Fox 10 Phoenix, shows that 54 percent of likely voters are backing Lake, a former news anchor for the station, while 45 percent are supporting Hobbs. About two percent of respondents are undecided. The Republican is reportedly polling better among older demographics and with Latinos.
