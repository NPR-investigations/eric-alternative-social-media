You know all the election mandates the Feds have forced on us over the last 2-3 decades? It was Linda Lamone behind it all pushing it. She is a Director of ERIC. She sits on other boards. If you want \"Dr Evil\" in elections it is Lamone.<br /><br />~ Peter Bernegger",

(Photo by Jim Watson-Pool/Getty Images)Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and FBI Director Christopher Wray have pooled resources to create a task force whose mission includes identifying, isolating, and terrorizing White Hat “collaborators,” an FBI whistleblower, or “5th Columnist,” told Real Raw News.The “5th Column” denote a growing number of FBI agents who, in the aftermath of the agency’s unlawful raid on Mar-a-Lago, began clandestinely helping White Hats in their mission to purge the Deep State. Sources in General Eric M. Smith’s office have put the number of “5th Columnists” at about 500, a figure the whistleblower confirmed. They have sworn to help White Hats topple the criminal Biden regime and its corrupt Dept. of Justice.Christopher Wray, though, discovered that agents under his command were working alongside White Hats to subvert his authority, but he had no idea which agents were sharing his sinister agenda—to deprive Americans of the rights and freedoms they hold dear—with the White Hat community. The search for double agents sent a paranoid Wray plummeting headfirst down a conspiratorial rabbit hole filled with real and imagined plots to deracinate him from the FBI. The whistleblower said that Wray’s eternal quest to find “Trump-supporting traitors” drove him mad.In January Wray tasked group supervisors and special agents in charge in D.C., Spokane, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Oklahoma City, New York City, and Miami with ferreting out “5th Columnists,” giving them three weeks to produce a list of names. When three weeks elapsed and the supervisors and agents in charge hadn’t uncovered even a single “5th columnist,” Wray went bonkers and accused them of being spies, demanding they take polygraphs to prove they were not counterintelligence agents secretly working for Donald Trump and General Smith. They all passed, and Wray’s insanity soared to new heights; he saw spies everywhere and plots hatching around him.“It’s gotten to the point Chris Wray trusts no one; even his immediate subordinates are suspect in his eyes.

They’re hiding it.    BREAKING: Trans male arrested for planning Colorado school shooting, had anti-Trump manifesto    Whitworth faces charges of attempted murder after allegedly making threads against schools in Colorado Springs, Colo.    By: The Post Millennial, April 6, 2023:    A trans-identified male who goes by Lilly, though his given name is William Whitworth, was arrested and charged after a police investigation in Colorado Springs revealed that the 19-year-old was responsible for “threats involving schools in Colorado Springs Academy District 20.”    Whitworth faces charges of attempted murder after allegedly making threats against schools in Colorado Springs, Colo., according to local news.    The Elbert County Sheriff’s Office charged Whitworth with two counts of a criminal attempt to commit murder in the first degree, criminal mischief, menacing, and interference with staff, faculty or students of educational institutions.    Whitworth is an alum of the school district and attended from 2014-16. Whitworth had attended Timberview Middle School in District 20, and an affidavit showed that this was the school Whitworth planned to target, for “no specific reason.”    The investigation began after the sheriff’s office was dispatched on March 31 due to a disturbance.    Deputies spoke with someone at the door on that day, and learned that another individual inside was “very upset and punched holes inside the walls.” Deputies, however, were not immediately allowed access to the residence.    Once inside, however, deputies found signs that someone had been punching holes in walls, and had ripped doors off their hinges. The person who reported the disturbance was reportedly Whitworth’s sister.    Deputies asked Whitworth if he had an intention of harming people at a school, and according to an affidavit, Whitworth indicated that this was the intention.    When asked why, Whitworth said “Why does anyone do it.”    Whitworth, deputies noted, appeared to be drunk and made suicidal statements. Additional targets per Whitworth’s manifesto were churches, and the planning had been ongoing for a month. Whitworth told officers that he had learned how to make a detonation device on YouTube.    Whitworth’s manifesto had a list of school people and shooters with notes next to their names:    “Eric and Dylan: Losers    “Adam Lanza: To smart    “Isreal Keyes: Degenerate    “Lauren Southern: Pathetic    “Vaush: Terrorist    “Donald J. Trump: Con-mam    “Bad cops: Useless garbage    “Stockholm, Name: Liam K.”    The manifesto’s contents detailed:    “A list of firearms and how to 3D print them; Detailed lists of numerous named individuals to be killed and their indented casualty versus injury rate. Information detailing the creation of improvised explosive devices; The Finalization of locations being Timberview Middle School, Prairie Hills Elementary, and Pine Creek High School.”    This comes after trans-identified female Audrey Hale shot 3 children and 3 adults to death in The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee.https://gellerreport.com/2023/04/trans-terrorist-murder-plot-foiled-in-colorado-targeting-three-schools.html/?lctg=88698594",

John Brennan, who lied about a domestic spying operation on Senate staffers, is above the law. Unlike Trump adviser Peter Navarro, Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder was never going to be handcuffed and thrown in prison for ignoring a congressional subpoena. He is above the law.Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, is also above the law. The then-secretary of state set up a private server in her home to circumvent transparency surrounding her slush fund foundation. She sent 110 emails containing marked classified information, and 36 of those emails contained secret information. Eight of the email chains contained “top secret” information. Every one of those instances was a potential felony punishable with up to 10 years in prison.We learned all of this from James Comey, then FBI director, who noted that Clinton had been “extremely careless” in conducting her business. Comey didn’t recommend charges because, he claimed, the state couldn’t prove Clinton’s intent—even though “gross negligence,” not intent, was the only standard he needed. Gross negligence and extreme carelessness are synonyms. Comey concocted a new standard to protect Clinton because she is above the law.When Hillary’s husband, also above the law, perjured himself under oath, Democrats argued that puritanical conservatives were only pursuing Bill because of some trumped-up charge over “sex.” Using that logic, Trump’s campaign finance charges related to Stormy Daniels’ “hush money” are also about sex. This is different because Trump is the boogeyman, and everyone knows he’s guilty of something. The important thing is getting that mug shot.Don’t worry, though; former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says, “Everyone has the right to a trial to prove innocence.” By “everyone,” she means Republicans. And if you think this authoritarian formulation is an accident, you haven’t been paying attention. When Democrats were smearing Brett Kavanaugh as a (gang) rapist a few years back, Sen. Mazie Hirono was asked whether the then-nominee deserved the “same presumption of innocence as anyone else in America?” After all, this wasn’t about any judicial disagreement but about alleged criminal behavior. The Hawaii senator responded, “I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases.”In other words, if you’re a conservative, your politics are evil; and if your politics are evil, you’re probably evil. I imagine that was the rationalization used by Kamala Harris when reading obvious fabrications about Kavanaugh into the Congressional Record. It is likely the rationalization of Lois Lerner or Merrick Garland—both above the law—when they weaponized government agencies against political opponents. It is almost surely the rationalization of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. This is what justifies the contemporary left’s increasing comfort with deploying the state to punish and destroy political enemies. For many progressives, the legal system isn’t merely a tool for criminal justice (if that) but a way to exact poetic political justice.Despite there being perfectly sound political arguments against Trump, we have been on a hysterical journey that has taken us from accusing Trump of being a seditious actor working on the orders of an antagonistic foreign government—the most successful conspiracy theory ever spun in American politics—to indicting him on some rickety seven-year-old campaign finance violation charge. Giving a porn star “hush money” is an immorality, not an illegality. Are DAs now going to be in the business of indicting political opponents who put $130,000 on the wrong side of the ledger during a race that cost hundreds of millions of dollars? I look forward to this kind of justice being meted out equally….[Click on my reply(ies) or link below for rest of article] https://www.theepochtimes.com/no-one-is-above-the-law-give-me-a-break_5180242.html?utm_source=share-btn-copylink",
