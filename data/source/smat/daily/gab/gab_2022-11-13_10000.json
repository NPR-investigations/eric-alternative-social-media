The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party‚Äôs first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party‚Äôs first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party‚Äôs national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party‚Äôs Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‚Äòalternative‚Äô parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode‚Äôs running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle‚Äôs running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party‚Äôs first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party‚Äôs first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party‚Äôs national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party‚Äôs Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‚Äòalternative‚Äô parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode‚Äôs running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle‚Äôs running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

Red hair was the genetic property, not skin color.<br /><a href=\"https://mysteriesrunsolved.com/2021/09/red-haired-giants.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>mysteriesrunsolved.com/2021/09/red-haired-gia<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">nts.html<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://www.denvermichaels.net/a-pygmy-tribe-in-ancient-tennessee/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>denvermichaels.net/a-pygmy-tribe-in-ancient-t<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">ennessee/<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://skjalden.com/what-did-the-vikings-look-like/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>skjalden.com/what-did-the-vikings-look-like/<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> Only some Vikings were tall and most were shorter. Some clans were large some small. The smaller clans claimed relation to the dwarves, however, all Viking culture believed they descended from these dwarves. There are tales of them sailing with descendants of giants also. They have detailed stories of giants making the Norse people thriveing in the days of the giants when man was supposedly being created in Eden.<\/p>",

How a situation can suddenly change so that a person who has been weak or unsucessful, suddenly becomes strong.  Enter President Biden.The old guy just kicked the crap out of the election deniers, and all those white supremacist assholes last Tuesday.  Trendlines now show Kari Lake of Arizona will most likely be losing her election for governor there to Katie Hobbs.   The last of the QAnon Clown Show members is going down.Speaking of QAnon and assholes;  where is Steve Bannon,  Stephen Miller,  Charlie Kirk,   Roger Stone,  Wendy Rogers,  Mark Finchem,  Gavin McInnes, Mike Flynn,  Little Nickie Fuentes,  Doug Mastriano, Don Jr.,  and  Eric Trump now???They have been quiet as church mice this week.  Not much to say it seems?You know the worm has turned when Candace Owens goes on her show and tells her viewers and listeners to dump Donald Trump now,  as in right now!Trump's  \"king maker\" title has been taken from him.  You know he is in deep kim chee and everyone at FoxNews is bashing Trump relentlessly.  Thanks to Rupert Murdoch,   and the New York Post, and pretty much every other newspaper in America as well.I for one will miss Donald Trump.  He makes the perfect punching bag for any intelligent person who needs a good laugh.  A comedians dream target.Andrew Torba has magically,  suddenly  turned away from Trump too.  And looking over some of his posts from just a year ago, the CEO of Gab went all in on Trump being the savior of the world, and the enabler of all White Supremacist Christian Nationalists in America.  And the Christian \"chosen one\".   Now Trump is nothing more than a bathroom attendant at the bus station in Miami.Torba wants his like minded ass holes to all move to Red states and build compounds!  Start their very own \"parallel society\" out in the sticks.  Where they can control their women,  stock up on guns and ammos, and indoctrinate their children.The new version of the  \"right wing fringe\" is gravitating towards Generalissimo Governor DeSantis now.  They are holding their noses,  to avoid the stench he gives off, and the GOP is crying like a bunch of little girls (Lindsey Graham cried on FoxNews),  because they know what the rest of us know;  MAGA finally found its way to the toilet.Once again they miscalculated what the American voters think.   Just a month ago I read no less than 10 different polls which said the \"red wave\" was coming and Trump's endorsed candidates would all cruise to easy victories.  Case in point;  8 polling companies on Oct. 24th stated John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was going to lose his election by 6 pts!   All 8 of them.  Whaaaat happened?  Simple.  They never polled a real sampling of Americans.  Who does not own a cell phone now?  Geriatric people with land lines whose names show up in the white pages.  That is who they polled.If anyone tried to call my cell phone in the last year from a polling company, those calls would be blocked.In just the last 6 months Steve Bannon,  Stephen Miller and Roger Stone the 3 stooges of Oath Keeper land,  promoted the leader of Hungary,  Viktor Orban as being the type of guy they wanted to run our country, with a wall between us and Mexico with razor wire on top,  and gun turrents,  unfettered hate speech on Twitter and all other social media, and white supremacists in power.  Even on the state level those ass holes were rejected completely by the voters with every single Trump endorsed MAGA candidate for Secretary of State, losing their elections nationwide!  Not one made it.One of the notable politicians who got his ass kicked in a wonderful  manner was Joe Kent of Washington State who ran for Congress in an overwhelming conservative GOP district there.  Joe Kent is openly racist, and proud of it according to his social media feeds.  Who did Joe Kent hate the most?   Mexicans.   Who beat him in his election there?  A Mexican woman named  Marie Perez.  Her family owns an auto repair shop.Talk about the worm turning!Doug Mastriano the anti-semite from Pennslvania got his ass kicked by a Jewish man named Josh Shapiro.Whaaaaat happened boys?Could it be Americans have finally rejected the whole MAGA thesis?   Apparently.And those poor Jan. 6th defendants who were sent off to Federal prisons, and those who have not been sentenced yet, and my favorite Oath Keeper asshole;  Stewart Rhodes,  actually thought this red wave bullshit would propel Trump back into the white house and he would only have to spend 2 years behind bars before Trump pardoned him and the other Jan. 6th insurrectionists.  That is not gonna happen now.Too bad, so sad.  üòé",
