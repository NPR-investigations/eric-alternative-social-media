Nikki Haley and the rest of the RINOs - undermined any effort to correct the theft of the 2020 presidential election by Biden/democratsNikki Haley has NEVER said it is just terrible that BIG TECH has been censuring/banning America First supporters, Anti-covid -19 jab supporters, etc. FOR YEARS.   Why?  Because   RINOS like her were NEVER censured or banned by BIG TECH because RINOs AGREE with the left and BOTH support endless wars, amnesty, open borders, shipping jobs overseas and bringing in thousands of foreign VISA workers to take what few jobs are left in the USA!!!!   Big Tech never had a reason to ban/censure a fellow America Last Supporter which RINOs are. Nikki Haley HAS NEVER DEFENDED TRUMP and indeed when she was at the UN she STAYED ON AFTER for MONTHS after she declared she was resigning because she wanted to stay in the job until AFTER the midterms while she trashed republicans to HURT GOP chances in the midterm which would reflect badly on Trump.   (Just Like Bush RINO Paul Ryan announced he was leaving but stayed a whole year until his term was up to block Trump's immigration plans etc).   The eyes of the entire country were on Haley Tuesday night, and rather than use that time to make a case against the Democrats, Haley squandered it by attacking the frontrunner, which is all anyone is talking about tonight.http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/13/nikki-haley-confirms-she-targeted-donald-trump-in-sotu-response-gop-leaders-approved/Nikki Haley FUCKING SAID NOTHING about America First 6 Jan POWs in Wash DC and indeed LIKED them being there.    RINOs HATE them as much as Dems do!!Nikki Haley SAID NOTHING about the left TARGETING Trump on every fake crime there and indeed she UNDERMINED America First TRUMP and Trump supporters AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY   (Her the the rest of her Bush RINOs (McConnell, McCarthy, Bushes, Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, etc)   She has NEVER said it was terrible that the FBI spied on Trump's campaign in 2015.!!!!   THE RINO BETRAYAL LIST TOWARDS AMERICA FIRST SUPPORTERS AND THE USA IS WAY TOO LONG TO LIST HERE BUT YOU KNOW THEM.  I will never help a RINO anymore than I would help a democrat.   Below is her BEGGING FOR MONEY for NON-RINOs to help her fight the left FINALLY attacking her. https://standforamerica.com/",

Why?  Because   RINOS like her were NEVER censured or banned by BIG TECH because RINOs AGREE with the left and BOTH support endless wars, amnesty, open borders, shipping jobs overseas and bringing in thousands of foreign VISA workers to take what few jobs are left in the USA!!!!   Big Tech never had a reason to ban/censure a fellow America Last Supporter which RINOs are. <br /><br />Nikki Haley HAS NEVER DEFENDED TRUMP and indeed when she was at the UN she STAYED ON AFTER for MONTHS after she declared she was resigning because she wanted to stay in the job until AFTER the midterms while she trashed republicans to HURT GOP chances in the midterm which would reflect badly on Trump.

RINO America LAST Supporter Nikki Haley does NOT give 2 shits about America FIRST Supporter Trump OR his smelly Walmart shoppers and she has the GALL to ask for our help for her.   Well....this America First Supporter's response is \"FUCK OFF AND DIE  AMERICA LAST RINO NIKKI HALEY AND ALL THE REST OF THE RINOS ALSO\"   I hope the left targets MORE RINOs in every way they have been doing to Trump and his America First supporters!  It is fun to watch the America Last Supporter LEFTISTS target a fellow America Last Support ally - RINO Nikki Haley.   I will grab the popcorn and watch...NOT HELP my enemy the RINOs. Nikki Haley and the rest of the RINOs - undermined any effort to correct the theft of the 2020 presidential election by Biden/democratsNikki Haley has NEVER said it is just terrible that BIG TECH has been censuring/banning America First supporters, Anti-covid -19 jab supporters, etc. FOR YEARS.   Why?  Because   RINOS like her were NEVER censured or banned by BIG TECH because RINOs AGREE with the left and BOTH support endless wars, amnesty, open borders, shipping jobs overseas and bringing in thousands of foreign VISA workers to take what few jobs are left in the USA!!!!   Big Tech never had a reason to ban/censure a fellow America Last Supporter which RINOs are. Nikki Haley HAS NEVER DEFENDED TRUMP and indeed when she was at the UN she STAYED ON AFTER for MONTHS after she declared she was resigning because she wanted to stay in the job until AFTER the midterms while she trashed republicans to HURT GOP chances in the midterm which would reflect badly on Trump.   (Just Like Bush RINO Paul Ryan announced he was leaving but stayed a whole year until his term was up to block Trump's immigration plans etc).   The eyes of the entire country were on Haley Tuesday night, and rather than use that time to make a case against the Democrats, Haley squandered it by attacking the frontrunner, which is all anyone is talking about tonight.http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/13/nikki-haley-confirms-she-targeted-donald-trump-in-sotu-response-gop-leaders-approved/Nikki Haley FUCKING SAID NOTHING about America First 6 Jan POWs in Wash DC and indeed LIKED them being there.    RINOs HATE them as much as Dems do!!Nikki Haley SAID NOTHING about the left TARGETING Trump on every fake crime there and indeed she UNDERMINED America First TRUMP and Trump supporters AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY   (Her the the rest of her Bush RINOs (McConnell, McCarthy, Bushes, Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, etc)   She has NEVER said it was terrible that the FBI spied on Trump's campaign in 2015.!!!!   THE RINO BETRAYAL LIST TOWARDS AMERICA FIRST SUPPORTERS AND THE USA IS WAY TOO LONG TO LIST HERE BUT YOU KNOW THEM.  I will never help a RINO anymore than I would help a democrat.

Why?  Because   RINOS like her were NEVER censured or banned by BIG TECH because RINOs AGREE with the left and BOTH support endless wars, amnesty, open borders, shipping jobs overseas and bringing in thousands of foreign VISA workers to take what few jobs are left in the USA!!!!   Big Tech never had a reason to ban/censure a fellow America Last Supporter which RINOs are. Nikki Haley HAS NEVER DEFENDED TRUMP and indeed when she was at the UN she STAYED ON AFTER for MONTHS after she declared she was resigning because she wanted to stay in the job until AFTER the midterms while she trashed republicans to HURT GOP chances in the midterm which would reflect badly on Trump.   (Just Like Bush RINO Paul Ryan announced he was leaving but stayed a whole year until his term was up to block Trump's immigration plans etc).   The eyes of the entire country were on Haley Tuesday night, and rather than use that time to make a case against the Democrats, Haley squandered it by attacking the frontrunner, which is all anyone is talking about tonight.http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/13/nikki-haley-confirms-she-targeted-donald-trump-in-sotu-response-gop-leaders-approved/Nikki Haley FUCKING SAID NOTHING about America First 6 Jan POWs in Wash DC and indeed LIKED them being there.
