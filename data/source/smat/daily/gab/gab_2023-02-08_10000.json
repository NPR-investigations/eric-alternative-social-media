Mais il a également ouvert une autre boîte de Pandore. Les quelque 2 000 employés publics licenciés pour avoir refusé de se faire vacciner ne retrouveront pas automatiquement leur emploi. M. Adams a déclaré que les 1 780 travailleurs licenciés pour avoir refusé de présenter une preuve de vaccination devront postuler à nouveau pour des postes dans leurs anciennes agences.Il s&#39;agit d&#39;agents de police, de pompiers, d&#39;enseignants et d&#39;autres employés municipaux. S&#39;ils sont réembauchés, ils ne seront pas indemnisés pour le temps passé sur le banc de touche.Les syndicats promettent d&#39;intenter un procès. &quot;Nous intentons un procès pour obtenir des arriérés de salaire pour tous les membres qui ont été mis en congé sans solde. L&#39;un des litiges est que c&#39;était illégal.

Quelques heures à peine après que le maire a levé l&#39;obligation de vaccination, les syndicats représentant les officiers de police, les pompiers et d&#39;autres employés de la ville qui ont perdu leur emploi ont déclaré qu&#39;ils allaient poursuivre la ville en justice et ont insisté pour qu&#39;ils obtiennent le remboursement des heures perdues.&quot;Archive : https://archive.is/pmra9",
