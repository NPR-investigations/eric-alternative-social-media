Among those testifying were Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt (R) and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry (R). During his tenure as the attorney general for Missouri, Sen. Schmitt, along with Mr. Landry, filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration in 2022 for alleged free speech violations. The other witnesses in attendance testified to constitutional concerns pertaining to violations of free speech and the impact of disinformation on social media platforms. Lawmakers from both parties throughout the hearing engaged in tense exchanges over the intent of the hearing.",

He says he wants to \"hold the platform accountable\", according to a new Bloomberg report. Joined by New York Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell, Adams has said the \"Kia Challenge\", a Tik Tok-based viral video showing how to steal Kia and Hyundai cars, is to blame for about 109 arrests made this year related to theft of Kia and Hyundai sedans. At a press conference Thursday, Adams said: ‚ÄúThis really emphasizes my continuous call for the responsible behavior of social media. This challenge in particular with Kia and Hyundai, we see it as not only stealing a vehicle, but it‚Äôs stealing the future of our young people.‚ÄùCar theft spiked during the pandemic and hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels, the report says. Grand larceny of vehicles in New York was up a stunning 32% last year, more than any other felony. According to Sewell, most thefts are taking place in the Bronx and northern Manhattan.The videos that Adams references targets Hyundais and Kias that lack an engine immobilizer, Bloomberg reports. They have made their way around social media since last September, targeting vehicles made in the 2015-2019 year range. When asked about his opinion about a ban on Tik Tok due to national security concerns, however, Adams responded: ‚ÄúI think that it‚Äôs imperative for Congress and the federal lawmakers to do a deep dive and come up with the right way to monitor social media.‚ÄùHe concluded: ‚ÄúAs we continue to decrease crime and move crime in the right direction, we don‚Äôt need aggravating factors such as what we‚Äôre seeing in a social media challenge of this magnitude.

The group flew from Palm Beach International to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and returned the same day to Palm Beach.",

The black and white clip is in poor condition. However I've managed to sharpen it slightly and inject some color.The autobiographical 'Johnny B. Goode' told the tale of a boy with humble beginnings with a talent for guitar. Some details were changed: Berry was from St. Louis, not Louisiana, and he knew how to read and write very well. He graduated from beauty school with a degree in hairdressing and cosmetology.The line \"that little country boy could play\" was originally \"that little coloured boy can play.\" Berry knew he had to change it if he wanted the song played on the radio, and he didn't want to alienate his white fans, who could better relate to the tale of a \"country\" boy.Berry got the name \"Johnny\" from Johnnie Johnson, a piano player who collaborated with Berry on many songs, including \"Maybellene,\" \"Roll Over Beethoven\" and \"Sweet Little 16.\" Johnson often wrote the songs on piano, and then Berry converted them to guitar and wrote lyrics. Berry joined Johnson's group, The Sir John Trio, in 1953, and quickly became the lead singer and centerpiece of the band.Johnson was very well-respected among many musicians. He played with Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, John Lee Hooker and many others before his death at age 80 in 2005.Berry lifted some guitar licks for this song: the intro came from the Louis Jordan song \"Ain't That Just Like A Woman,\" and the guitar break came from a 1950 T-Bone Walker song called \"Strollin' With Bones.\" Jordan was a very influential R&amp;B singer and a huge influence on Berry; Walker was a famous guitarist in the '40s and early '50s who came up with an electric guitar sound and raucous stage act that Berry incorporated.Berry got the word \"Goode\" from the street in St. Louis where he grew up. He lived at 2520 Goode Avenue, which in 1986 was renamed Annie Malone Drive after the woman who financed a children's home on the street.Credited as \"the first rock &amp; roll hit about rock &amp; roll stardom\",it has been recorded by many other artists and has received several honours and accolades. The song is also ranked seventh on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".https://fb.watch/jErcmU__U2/",

He lived at 2520 Goode Avenue, which in 1986 was renamed Annie Malone Drive after the woman who financed a children's home on the street.<br />Credited as \"the first rock &amp; roll hit about rock &amp; roll stardom\",it has been recorded by many other artists and has received several honours and accolades. The song is also ranked seventh on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".<br /><br /><a href=\"https://fb.watch/jErcmU__U2/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>fb.watch/jErcmU__U2/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

Luft served as an adviser to CEFC China Energy, a conglomerate that \"aligned itself so closely with the Chinese government that it was often hard to distinguish between the two,\" according to CNN. The group, which donated at least $350,000 to Luft‚Äôs think tank, paid Hunter Biden at least $6 million in 2017 to procure energy investment deals in the United States.Luft‚Äôs claims come as a former Hunter Biden business partner, Eric Schwerin, has started cooperating with the House Oversight Committee‚Äôs investigation of the Biden family‚Äôs foreign business dealings. Investigators have focused heavily on Hunter Biden‚Äôs work with CEFC China Energy. The Justice Department has investigated Hunter Biden since 2018 over his taxes and foreign business dealings, though the case appears to be focused on the first son‚Äôs unpaid taxes.Luft‚Äôs threat to \"name names\" comes after his arrest in Cyprus on Feb. 16 on charges that he illegally sold weapons to Libya and China. Luft asserts that the United States is seeking his extradition as part of a \"politically motivated\" payback for his exposure of the Bidens.\"DOJ is trying to bury me to protect Joe, Jim &amp; Hunter Biden,\" Luft said. An Israeli lawyer for Luft claims his client provided information about Hunter Biden to the FBI in 2019.While Luft‚Äôs claims might otherwise be easily dismissed as a bluff, his connection to CEFC China Energy suggests he may know something about the Bidens. And an American lawyer for Luft has signaled he will provide information to Congress about Luft‚Äôs case.\"Dr. Luft is a whistleblower,\" Luft attorney Robert Henoch told the Washington Free Beacon. He asserts that prosecutors decided against pursuing Luft's information \"and are instead targeting him with trumped-up and false charges.\"\"This unfortunately appears to be part of an attempt to discredit a witness with critical information about an ongoing congressional and DOJ investigation.\"Henoch did not further elaborate on the information Luft has on Biden. But the lawyer recently told the Justice Department he plans to submit a letter to Congress that will detail statements that Luft gave to the Justice Department during an interview in Belgium, according to documents obtained by the Free Beacon.Luft served as a liaison between CEFC China Energy and the Institute for Analysis of Global Security, a Washington think tank formed by former CIA director James Woolsey. Luft, who is co-director of the Institute, served as senior adviser to the China Energy Fund Committee, the think tank arm of CEFC China Energy. Ye Jianming, the former chairman of CEFC China, served as chairman of the board of trustees of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, according to a business prospectus created by one of Hunter Biden‚Äôs business associates. CEFC also donated at least $350,000 to the Institute, which has promoted China‚Äôs controversial Belt and Road infrastructure program.Luft also forged close ties to Patrick Ho, a CEFC executive who was convicted in 2019 of trying to bribe African officials for oil rights on behalf of CEFC. Luft referred to Ho as a \"close friend and colleague\" in a letter in support of Ho, according to court documents.Hunter Biden worked closely with Ye and represented Ho in his legal case.Biden met with Ye at the Chinese businessman‚Äôs homes in New York and Miami. Ye, who is suspected of having ties to Chinese military intelligence, gave Hunter an $80,000 diamond in one of their meetings.
