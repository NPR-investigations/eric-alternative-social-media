This is for the Empire that now stands in the place of our once proud Republic on a mountain of corpses to maintain global hegemony. That's why in 2014 then Vice President oversaw the overthrow of the Democratically elected President of Ukraine..He was regime changed...If you doubt Washington DC had anything to do with it I have a bridge to sell you in Libya. Thanks to leaked phone calls we know for a fact that the current under secretary of State, Victoria Nuland, personally hand picked the leaders of the new government..You can hear the phone call in her own voice..Is this what Democracy looks like? I don't think so... And after the coup, the new government, urged on by local neo nazi groups like the the Azov Battalion..they succeeded in banning the speaking of Russian and launching an ethnic cleansing campaign in the eastern regions of Ukraine..\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SenatorBrakey",

The Sun's annual corkscrew journey begins at the Tropic of Capricorn on the winter solstice where it makes its fastest and largest circle over and around the Earth. For the next three months every day the Sun slightly narrows its path and slows its speed until by the spring equinox the Sun has spiraled its way from the Tropic of Capricorn to the equator. Then for the next three months again every day the Sun continues to slightly constrict its path and retard its speed until the summer solstice when the Sun makes its smallest, slowest circle around the Tropic of Cancer. Once the Sun reaches this innermost circle, it then begins its opposing, expanding, quickening journey back toward the Tropic of Capricorn. For the next three months every day the Sun slightly widens its path and hastens its speed until the by the autumnal equinox the Sun has spiraled its way from the Tropic of Cancer back to the equator. Then for the next three months again every day the Sun continues to slightly expand its path and increase its speed until the winter solstice when the Sun repeats its largest, fastest circle around the Tropic of Capricorn and the annual corkscrew journey begins again.The following video \"How do Seasons Work on Flat Earth?\" was taken from a chapter in my book \"Flat Earth FAQ\" available here:  http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubayGet Connected With Me:Website: http://www.EricDubay.comBlog: http://www.AtlanteanConspiracy.comForum: http://www.IFERS.123.stBooks: http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubayFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/edfes/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericdubaz/Twitter: https://twitter.com/ericdubayGettr: https://gettr.com/user/eric_dubaySoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/eric-dubay/Mewe: https://mewe.com/i/ericdubayMinds: https://www.minds.com/EricDubayGab: https://gab.ai/Eric-DubayGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/ericdubayYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/c/flatearthericOdysee: https://odysee.com/@EricDubay:cBitChute: https://www.bitchute.com/channel/TCgwKoAf3Y9z/Real Truthseekers: https://real-truth-seekers.com/@ericdubayRokfin: https://rokfin.com/EricDubayRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1286253Dollar Vigilante: https://dollarvigilante.tv/c/eric.dubay/videosTelegram: http://t.me/flatearthericdubayEmail: ericdubaynewsletter@protonmail.com",

The Sun's annual corkscrew journey begins at the Tropic of Capricorn on the winter solstice where it makes its fastest and largest circle over and around the Earth. For the next three months every day the Sun slightly narrows its path and slows its speed until by the spring equinox the Sun has spiraled its way from the Tropic of Capricorn to the equator. Then for the next three months again every day the Sun continues to slightly constrict its path and retard its speed until the summer solstice when the Sun makes its smallest, slowest circle around the Tropic of Cancer. Once the Sun reaches this innermost circle, it then begins its opposing, expanding, quickening journey back toward the Tropic of Capricorn. For the next three months every day the Sun slightly widens its path and hastens its speed until the by the autumnal equinox the Sun has spiraled its way from the Tropic of Cancer back to the equator. Then for the next three months again every day the Sun continues to slightly expand its path and increase its speed until the winter solstice when the Sun repeats its largest, fastest circle around the Tropic of Capricorn and the annual corkscrew journey begins again.The following video \"How do Seasons Work on Flat Earth?\" was taken from a chapter in my book \"Flat Earth FAQ\" available here:  http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubayGet Connected With Me:Website: http://www.EricDubay.comBlog: http://www.AtlanteanConspiracy.comForum: http://www.IFERS.123.stBooks: http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubayFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/edfes/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericdubaz/Twitter: https://twitter.com/ericdubayGettr: https://gettr.com/user/eric_dubaySoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/eric-dubay/Mewe: https://mewe.com/i/ericdubayMinds: https://www.minds.com/EricDubayGab: https://gab.ai/Eric-DubayGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/ericdubayYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/c/flatearthericOdysee: https://odysee.com/@EricDubay:cBitChute: https://www.bitchute.com/channel/TCgwKoAf3Y9z/Real Truthseekers: https://real-truth-seekers.com/@ericdubayRokfin: https://rokfin.com/EricDubayRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1286253Dollar Vigilante: https://dollarvigilante.tv/c/eric.dubay/videosTelegram: http://t.me/flatearthericdubayEmail: ericdubaynewsletter@protonmail.com",

They argued that, because he was serving in his capacity as president of the Senate that day, he was protected from being forced to testify under the Constitution's “speech or debate” clause, which is intended to protect members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts.Pence’s team is evaluating whether it will appeal.The sealed ruling from U.S. District Judge James “Jeb” Boasberg sets up the unprecedented scenario of a former vice president being compelled to give potentially damaging testimony against the president he once served. And it comes as Pence has been inching closer to announcing a run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, which would put him in direct competition with his former boss.",

Locke, 33, reportedly opened his account in November 2020 and had over 100 posts.“White collar professional by day… very unprofessional by night. always amateur, always raw, always slutty,” his OnlyFans description reportedly read.Locke admitted on his Twitter account that he was a judge.On multiple occasions, Locke made inappropriate comments to NYC public servants online.The New York Post explained:    “Eric Adams can suck my c–t,” Locke tweeted in a March 1 post from his PG-rated account, after the mayor made comments criticizing the separation of church and state.    Locke told City Councilwoman Vickie Paladino to “choke on a d–k” Sunday in a tweeted response to her criticism of Drag Queen Story Hour in public libraries and schools.    “This city must have absolute faith in its courts at every level, and employing individuals like Mr. Locke in positions of legal authority only corrodes the people’s trust in the professionalism and impartiality of our institutions,” Paladino told The Post.    Locke’s after-dark activities run afoul of city rules governing out-of-court behavior, she added.    “A city administrative law judge shall conduct all of his or her extra-judicial activities so that they do not cast reasonable doubt on the city administrative law judge’s capacity to act impartially as a city administrative law judge,” and “do not detract from the dignity of judicial office,” according to city rules of conduct.http://nyc.gov explained the duties of an Administrative Law Judge:    OATH’s mission is to provide fair and timely hearings. This is achieved through independent adjudication and creative problem-solving. An Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) adjudicates cases involving different subject matter areas, including civil service law, zoning and land use, licensing, conflicts of interest, city contracts, human rights law and vehicle seizures. OATH ALJs maintain the highest standards of ethics, both professionally and personally and are appointed by the Chief Administrative Law Judge for a term of five years.    Administrative Law Judges:    • Conduct formal hearings pursuant to federal, state, and local law    • Prepare written decisions that include a summary and analysis of evidentiary and legal issues    • Presides at pre-trial settlement conferences    • Supervises law clerks and secretarial staff    Qualifications include the admission to practice law for at least five years in the State of New York and five years of recent full-time relevant legal experience subsequent to Bar Admission (or a satisfactory equivalent).    This is the type of degenerate sicko we have on the bench here in New York City.

After combing through all of this data, astronomers can now characterize just how bright it was and better understand its scientific impact.“GRB 221009A was likely the brightest burst at X-ray and gamma-ray energies to occur since human civilization began,” said Eric Burns, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He led an analysis of some 7,000 GRBs – mostly detected by NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the Russian Konus instrument on NASA’s Wind spacecraft – to establish how frequently events this bright may occur. Their answer: once in every 10,000 years.The burst was so bright it effectively blinded most gamma-ray instruments in space, which means they could not directly record the real intensity of the emission. U.S. scientists were able to reconstruct this information from the Fermi data. They then compared the results with those from the Russian team working on Konus data and Chinese teams analyzing observations from the GECAM-C detector on their SATech-01 satellite and instruments on their Insight-HXMT observatory. Together, they prove the burst was 70 times brighter than any yet seen.Burns and other scientists presented new findings about the BOAT at the High Energy Astrophysics Division meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Waikoloa, Hawaii. Observations of the burst span the spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays, and include data from many NASA and partner missions, including the NICER X-ray telescope on the International Space Station, NASA’s NuSTAR observatory, and even Voyager 1 in interstellar space. Papers describing the results presented appear in a focus issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.The signal from GRB 221009A had been traveling for about 1.9 billion years before it reached Earth, making it among the closest-known “long” GRBs, whose initial, or prompt, emission lasts more than two seconds. Astronomers think these bursts represent the birth cries of black holes formed when the cores of massive stars collapse under their own weight. As it quickly ingests the surrounding matter, the black hole blasts out jets in opposite directions containing particles accelerated to near the speed of light. These jets pierce through the star, emitting X-rays and gamma rays as they stream into space.With this type of GRB, astronomers expect to find a brightening supernova a few weeks later, but so far it has proven elusive. One reason is that the GRB appeared in a part of the sky that’s just a few degrees above the plane of our own galaxy, where thick dust clouds can greatly dim incoming light.As the jets continue to expand into material surrounding the doomed star, they produce a multiwavelength afterglow that gradually fades away.The jets themselves were not unusually powerful, but they were exceptionally narrow – much like the jet setting of a garden hose – and one was pointed directly at us, Alexander explained. The closer to head-on we view a jet, the brighter it appears. Although the afterglow was unexpectedly dim at radio energies, it’s likely that GRB 221009A will remain detectable for years, providing a novel opportunity to track the full life cycle of a powerful jet.The burst also enabled astronomers to probe distant dust clouds in our own galaxy. As the prompt X-rays traveled toward us, some of them reflected off of dust layers, creating extended “light echoes” of the initial blast in the form of X-ray rings expanding from the burst’s location. The X-ray Telescope on NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory discovered the presence of a series of echoes. Detailed follow-up by ESA’s (the European Space Agency’s) XMM-Newton telescope, together with Swift data, revealed these extraordinary rings were produced by 21 distinct dust clouds.GRB 221009A is only the seventh gamma-ray burst to display X-ray rings, and it triples the number previously seen around one. The echoes came from dust located between 700 and 61,000 light-years away. The most distant echoes – clear on the other side of our Milky Way galaxy – were also 4,600 light-years above the galaxy’s central plane, where the solar system resides.",

Waco on the anniversary of the Waco Siege of 1993 between the Branch Dividians and the ATF/FBI.   Given the span of time, the changing dynamics, and a greater insight into our government, the Waco Siege takes on a different story.   The account that Koresh had no education but memorized the entirety of the Bible is an important notation.   It would indicate that perhaps he had Asperger’s.   The account that there was child sexual abuse was completely obliterated by medical professionals who examined all 25 surviving children.   The ‘underage bride’ discreditation has also been quashed given the legal age of marriage in Texas is 14 with parental consent.Therefore, what we have is a cult living as a cult doing their own thing that would appear to be legal within the state of Texas.   Except for the STASH of weapons, they might have remained under the radar.   But Koresh and the other 40 males of the property legally bought quite an inventory as defense in the event of a government insurrection upon his property.The ATF felt the weapons might be used to harm civilians.   As they declared after the fact.   The ATF felt that raiding this compound despite there having been no previous harm – was justified.   Bringing tanks and gas cylinders that ignited upon contact was approved by newly minted AG, Janet Reno.At this point, Reno was working under Bill Clinton, and alongside Eric Holder, Bill Barr, and Jamie Gorlick.   The Rascals…looking to initiate the Soros World Order.   The Waco massacre was a MEDIA MESS.   The FBI fabricated stories, lied and attempted to redirect the events.   Sound familiar?  Should – because this is what the FBI CONTINUALLY does.Unfortunately for the 80 children, women and men who were shot and subsequently burned in the incendiary furnace that consumed their compound the apology from the FBI that maybe they could have done things differently – doesn’t sit well.    The tanks expelling those gas incendiaries – well we didn’t think they would cause a fire…     This is not Jim Jones – this is an off-the-grid group of anti-government, anti-control young people seeking to live life as they see fit without breaking the law.   The child assault allegations were found to be frivolous and everything above board when physicians examined the surviving 25 children found them healthy and perfect.   In other words this was an off-cult of less than 200 who chose a lifestyle that was a bit 60ish.   If they hadn’t chosen to stash themselves an arsenal of defensive weapons … history might be different.I am reminded of the ‘commune children of the 60’s’.   No one sought to burn them at the stake…Waco was Clinton”s introduction into chaos, disorder and blackmail.    At this point of Clinton’s presidency he was already embroiled in three different sexual assault accusations.   What better way to deflect and detract than a the creation of a false allegation of child sexual assaults and polygamy against a small unknown cult.    I doubt even Clinton believed the ultimate outcome of his handler’s recommendation would result in one of the most explosive Crimes in decades.   The government just assassinated over 80 American citizens including children –CLEANUP IN AISLE 41!Theodore Olsen, an attorney for Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, lost his wife in the 9-11 Pentagon hijacking.    A member of The Federalist and a Paul Ryan advocate, Olsen once commented that he felt that it is morally acceptable for the government to lie.   Lying is for the Greater Good: Lying is good.   Lying is to protect the feeble American Patriots.    Pledge Allegiance is simply – another lie.  Yet, he revealed then and now and every moment in-between, exactly what the American People are fighting – LIES.9-11 was created to cover for the Pentagon’s blackbook missing $trillions in ‘taxpayer money’.   After 9-11, the missing money agenda was buried.   Just like Clinton buried his affairs in a Waco Siege.

At one point, co-anchor Wilson Stribling floated the idea that a newsroom journalist may get a tattoo like Martha Stewart inspired by Snoop Dogg.\"Fo shizzle, my nizzle,\" Bassett gleefully responded, seemingly unaware that \"nizzle\" is slang for the n-word.Standing at the far end of the desk, Meteorologist Patrick Ellis appeared shocked by the comment.Bassett did not return to the anchor desk after the March 8 incident. As reported by the Clarion Ledger, Bassett is no longer listed as a news team member.Bassett, who is White, also tweeted the phrase in 2011, but the post has since been deleted.This is not the first time Bassett has found herself at the center of controversy.In October 2022, Bassett, who was WLBT’s first-ever chief meteorologist, apologized after using the phrase \"grandmammy\" while speaking with a Black female reporter, who she also called \"girl\" and \"sis.\"\"Though not intentional, I now understand how my comment was both insensitive and hurtful. I have apologized to Carmen Poe,\" Bassett said at the time. \"Now, I would like to apologize to you. That is not the heart of who I am. And for that, I humbly ask for your forgiveness and I apologize to everyone I have offended.\"\"I will learn from this and participate in training so I can better understand our history and our people. I can’t mend the hurt my comment caused. I pray you’ll forgive me and that you’ll extend grace through this awful mistake,\" Bassett added.Bassett’s latest slip-up went viral over the weekend. While some criticized Bassett’s choice of words, she also received support from Charlamagne tha God.\"I don’t think she should have been fired for that,\" Charlamagne said on \"The Breakfast Club\" podcast. \"She might not even know what ‘nizzle’ means, yo. Come on, like stop. That’s not a reason to fire that woman.\"According to Bassett’s resume, she graduated from Mississippi College in 1993 and went on to earn a Master of Science degree at Mississippi State University with a focus on broadcast meteorology.Last month, Meghan Mangrum, an education journalist who joined the Dallas newspaper in August 2022, claimed she was fired for using the term \"bruh\" in a tweet directed at Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, D.”On that note...I never knew the meaning. I just thought it was a word Snoop Dogg used to to rhyme with shizzle. And she most likely had no idea as well. But if Snoop had said it ...then the network would have invited him back for another appearance.You don’t necessary fire a good news anchor for saying something she did not Know what it meant.. BUT ITS OK FOR SNOOP DOGG TO TALK SLANG... WITH KIDS WATCHING?Don’t understand the double standard. If it is ok for one and not the other... that is not equality. She may not have understood the meaning until explained as I didn’t. Just sounds catchy snd funny. Lighten up... People need to get a grip.Anyhow...Sooo just curious. Who decides what is slang and what is offensive and who is offended? Who made up this word? Did they intend it to be derogatory? Who did they tell when they determined it was derogatory so people were aware that it was offensive?I remember Eminem used these terms in a rap song and everyone thought it was funny and hip. Apparently only certified White people can use the language created by Snoop Dogg.
