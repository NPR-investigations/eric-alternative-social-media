            "description": "by WorldTribune Staff, March 1, 2022\r\n\r\nPolice body cam video out of Salida, Colorado shows former Dominion Voting Systems executive Eric Coomer continually denying to police that he was responsible for crashing his truck into a building before finally admitting he indeed was behind the wheel.\r\n\r\n[caption id=attachment_106843 align=alignleft width=425] Eric Coomer[/caption]\r\n\r\nDespite being told that several witnesses had described him to a T and police saying damage to his truck matched damage to the building, Coomer continues to deny responsibility before telling the police to speak to his lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in September of last year but the body cam footage did not emerge on YouTube until Monday.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the body cam video, after police had spoken to the lawyer and explained that Coomer could be charged with a felony, Coomer finally comes clean and admits crashing into the building, saying he was under a lot of stress and then telling the police they could Google my name.\r\n\r\nPolice also tell the lawyer that Coomer managed to avoid a DUI by going to a local bar and having a few shots of alcohol immediately after the crash.\r\n\r\nJoe Oltmann, the Denver businessman who received death threats after exposing Coomer for boasting about being able to rig the 2020 election against President Donald Trump, wrote in a Telegram post:\r\n\r\nYeah… guy hits a building, lies about that he did it, three times… says he panicked. But he had nothing to do with the stealing of an election, ties to Antifa and deleting all his social accounts and posts before filing a lawsuit? Nah… all that is just a coincidence. My life has been turned upside down while this piece of excrement continues to wreak havoc on others. Even after we have the proof that the machines are stealing elections and proof mounts… they continue to lie, more… the counter suits and suits are going to be very fun.\r\n\r\nRelated: Who is Eric Coomer of Dominion Voting Systems?, November 17, 2020\r\n\r\nCoomer was vice president of U.S. engineering for Dominion Voting Systems. According to his biography, Coomer graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics. He was later promoted to voting systems officer of strategy and security at Dominion.\r\n\r\nOltmann exposed Coomer as having told Antifa members: “Don’t worry about the election, Trump’s not gonna win. I made f*cking sure of that!”\r\n\r\nOltmann said he was banned from Twitter after exposing Coomer.\r\n\r\nTrump White House adviser Garrett Ziegler, whose Marco Polo research group is investigating the 2020 election and Hunter Biden. said of Coomer in a Telegram post: Full take.. this guy is a MESS! And, more importantly, he is a Bolshevik!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Why WorldTribune? . . . . Executive Intelligence Brief",

His son, Eric, grew up in Lake County, FL and was tragically killed in Iraq in 2004 when his unit was ambushed and a bomb went off, blowing up his Humvee. His widow and two grown children were there today (pictured above). Eric’s son an daughter were still babies when their father paid the ultimate sacrifice for our nation in 2004. Eric is buried at the Flordia National Cemetery. It was an honor to attend the Memorial Day service today and stand with, honor, and pay respect to a Gold Star family from my own district, FL 11.

              "description": "Brilliant news out of Geneva today!\r\nAs most of you know, the World Health Assembly has spent the past 7 days considering Biden’s 13 controversial amendments to the International Health Regulations. Official delegates from wealthy developed nations like Australia, the UK, and the US spoke in strong support of the amendments and urged other states to join them in signing away their countries’ sovereignty. The first sign, however, that things might not be going the globalists’ way, came on Wednesday, the 25th of May, which just happened to also be Africa Day. Botswana read a statement on behalf of its 47 AFRO members, saying they would be collectively withholding their support for the ‘reforms’, which many African members were very concerned about. Multiple other countries also said they had reservations over the changes and would not be supporting them either. These included Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran and Malaysia.",

The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.https://www.biblegateway.com/There are literally dozens of each, cults and false religions. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah, again the Hebrew Roots Movement and again Roman Catholicism. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, both Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of cults and those false religions.The wrong “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to.

Not very well. In Roman Catholic theology, the saints are in heaven. In the Bible, the saints are on earth. In Roman Catholic teaching, a person does not become a saint unless he/she is ‘beatified’ or ‘canonized’ by the Pope or prominent bishop. In the Bible, everyone who has received Jesus Christ by faith is a saint. In Roman Catholic practice, the saints are revered, prayed to, and in some instances, worshiped. In the Bible, saints are called to revere, worship, and pray to God alone.”https://www.gotquestions.org/saints-Christian.htmlA “cult” is deemed so since it claims to have faith in Jesus but it fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There’s also ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. (Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Eric von Anderseck of the Second Eighth Week Apostles (S8W), Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L.

Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:3-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm )  is only qualified to teach the new covenant (study 2 Corinthians 3:4-11).

They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There’s also ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. (Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Eric von Anderseck of the Second Eighth Week Apostles (S8W), Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L.
