We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

If you are honestly searching for proof I can provide it. Just don't ask for it and then tell me you don't have time to look at it once it's given to you.

Is the Department of Justice possibly committing Brady violations?<br /><br />“When Christopher Wray told the world that the FBI had no … verifiable or credible evidence that January 6 was going to happen, that’s a complete and total lie because they had placed FBI confidential human sources there,” argues Kash Patel.<br /><br />“The Department of Justice is taking an active position to prosecute people when they have not fully investigated the case and know[ing] there’s information out there that might be beneficial to a number of the defendants they are currently prosecuting.”<br /><br />Kash Patel and Jan Jekielek discuss recent reporting about FBI informants within Proud Boys, Christopher Wray’s testimony on Jan. 6, and likely Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy’s plans to remove Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Eric Swalwell, and Rep. Ilhan Omar from committee assignments.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/kashs-corner-what-did-the-fbi-know-before-jan-6_4885960.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theepochtimes.com/kashs-corner-what-did-the-f<span class=\"invisible\">bi-know-before-jan-6_4885960.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

It’s just sick. It has no, no social redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single, solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers,” Biden said, before adding that he would “try to get rid of assault weapons” during the lame-duck session of Congress.Biden did not offer any explanation for what he considers to be an “assault weapon,” and his blanket remarks on “semi-automatic weapons” technically encompasses rifles and handguns alike, further proving his lack of knowledge of firearms.“I’m going to do it whenever I — I got to make that assessment as I get in and start counting the votes,” he said, admitting that he may not have the votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster by Republicans.Although Democrats have been projected to retain control of the U.S. Senate, and may even increase their majority to 51-49, Republicans are on track to retake the House of Representatives, with a majority as high as 4-5 seats above the 218 threshold. The new Congress will be sworn in on January 3rd, 2023. As such, Democrats have been looking to take advantage of the remaining lame-duck session to force through several radical bills, including a bill codifying gay marriage and further gun control restrictions.",

Many major news outlets also chose not to promote the story because it was linked to Mr Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani. The story turned out not to be disinformation, but other media outlets that independently verified emails found no illicit behavior from Mr Biden or his son.Mr Musk’s move comes shortly after Republicans won back the House of Representatives.

Since early 2020, TV and print profiles have deluged Fauci with endless adulation, spurring the sale of Fauci votive candles, Fauci bobbleheads and #trustFauci Twitter hashtags. But Wednesday, Fauci’s mind vanished.&quot;Or at least that’s what he claimed. A federal judge compelled Fauci to answer questions from lawyers suing toreveal the role of “dozens of federal officials across at least 11 federal agencies “ to suppress “disfavored speakers, viewpoints and content on social-media platforms.” That lawsuit is exposing how Biden’s war on disinformation is demolishing Americans’ freedom of speech.&quot;Fauci was deposed on Wednesday [link] by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry. Landry labeled Fauci the “man who single-handedly wrecked the US economy based upon ‘the science, follow the science.’” But “over the course of seven hours, we discovered that he can’t recall practically anything dealing with his COVID response,” Landry said.&quot;So Fauci is “omniscient except during depositions”?&quot;Missouri Attorney General Schmitt said the deposition revealed [link]: “When Fauci speaks — social media censors.“ The lawsuit will continue to expose federal shenanigans with perhaps the biggest bombshells still to come.&quot;How many lies did Fauci tell on Wednesday? The transcript has not been released, but a few “pants on fire” snippets have come out. &quot;.. [the &quot;snippets&quot;]&quot;Perhaps Fauci will paraphrase a quotation attributed to Stalin: “One death is a tragedy but 100,000 deaths are just a statistic.” Despite all the sacrifices Fauci sanctified, more than 200 million Americans still contracted COVID, according to the Centers for Disease Control.&quot;Maybe Fauci’s memory has recovered since being compelled to explain how he used his power. But we must never forget how politicians pretended that stomping the Constitution would magically “flatten the curve” and keep us safe. America will not fully recover from the pandemic until all the COVID lies and abuses by officialdom have been exposed.&quot;Many Pols/Bureaucrats are likely to cover their own idiotic asses in various ways for following the non-science that spewed not just from Fauci&#39;s mouth but MANY other supposed &quot;Science Authorities&quot; also masquerading as Omniscient.",

Landry labeled Fauci the “man who single-handedly wrecked the US economy based upon ‘the science, follow the science.’” But “over the course of seven hours, we discovered that he can’t recall practically anything dealing with his COVID response,” Landry said.<\/p><p>&quot;<strong>So Fauci is “omniscient except during depositions”?<\/strong><\/p><p>&quot;Missouri Attorney General Schmitt said the deposition revealed [link]: “When Fauci speaks — social media censors.“ The lawsuit will continue to expose federal shenanigans with perhaps the biggest bombshells still to come.<\/p><p>&quot;How many lies did Fauci tell on Wednesday? The transcript has not been released, but a few “pants on fire” snippets have come out. <br />&quot;.. [the &quot;snippets&quot;]<\/p><p>&quot;Perhaps Fauci will paraphrase a quotation attributed to Stalin: “One death is a tragedy but 100,000 deaths are just a statistic.” Despite all the sacrifices Fauci sanctified, more than 200 million Americans still contracted COVID, according to the Centers for Disease Control.<\/p><p>&quot;Maybe Fauci’s memory has recovered since being compelled to explain how he used his power. <strong>But we must never forget how politicians pretended that stomping the Constitution would magically “flatten the curve” and keep us safe. America will not fully recover from the pandemic until all the COVID lies and abuses by officialdom have been exposed.<\/strong>&quot;<\/p><p>Many Pols/Bureaucrats are likely to cover their own idiotic asses in various ways for following the non-science that spewed not just from Fauci&#39;s mouth but MANY other supposed &quot;Science Authorities&quot; also masquerading as Omniscient.<\/p>",

Please ask Dr. Burnett if he will accept Dr. Cole’s invitation to resolve the matter. He will never accept the invitation.Dr. Cole’s response to Dr. Burnett doesn’t pull any punchesEric Burnett, MD is an internist, not a pathologist, nor mortician. The arrogance of inferring that a mortician, a professional, beyond his experience, cannot make a valid observation beyond his own naïveté, is the epitome of hubris. He has likely seen one or two autopsies in his entire career. He has not seen, observed, nor described countless post mortem clots. A gelatinous saddle embolus is “apples to oranges” compared to these post “clot shot” death clots. He has never embalmed a body. He is entirely and exceedingly out of his lane. Post mortem, rubbery clots are as rare as hen’s teeth. He is likely covering his “gene injection” pushing ass. Morticians did not have trouble cannulating and embalming bodies prior to the jabs. He is acting as a bloviating, pharma, financial and hospital administrator defending shill, having zero experience, nor idea of what he speaks.Something is overwhelmingly wrong with the “clot shot.” If he were half awake, his conjecture would not be reflecting  the myopic view of the inside of his inexperienced anus.With a modicum of humility, he might acknowledge alarming rates of excess deaths in the hyper injected, young and healthy and see the actual harm of failed gene based experimental injections, that have maimed and killed hundreds of thousands to millions.Having performed countless career autopsies, examined dozens of these novel clots, extensively explored the spike protein clotting mechanisms, diagnosed over 500,000 patients through the microscope, in my extensive career, I invite my colleague, Dr. Burnett, and any colleague, from around the world, to sit at my microscope, and observe the truth, and set aside their purchased pride. The cells don’t lie!!!Honor the dead who speak loudly. Stop fantasizing that you can ever vaccinate ahead of an always mutating coronavirus, especially with a “variant expired” investigational gene product.Honor your oath to “first do no harm,” instead of hiding behind an uninformed ego, shaded with harmfully naïve, humanity destroying pride.https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/answering-the-critics-of-died-suddenly",

          "content": "During the history of the Aryan race, brave White men and women have fought and died for ideas. The Aryan fighting spirit is Ingrained in our Race soul, it's an integral part of who we are as a race. Take for example: the bravery of Leonidas, the lion's son of http://Sparta.In August 480 BC, Leonidas set out to meet Xerxes's army at Thermopylae with a small, but well-organized and disciplined force of 300, though vastly outnumbered Leonidas exemplified the Aryan traits of Honor, Loyalty and Courage when he died a warrior's death during the Battle of Thermopylae that day. Let's not forget the brave White men who defended the Alamo against the tsunami of Mexicans on March 6,1836, though overwhelmed by the advancing non-white army, they displayed Courage, superior fighting ability, and the Will to Win, even though the odds were against them. These were the men of our race and the same blood is within us all!Idealism is a powerful force, especially in the hearts and minds of intrepid Idealists. I'm reminded of an intrepid idealist, who was born in Austria on April 20th,1889, his great name often invokes instant condemnation from the Bolshevik Beasts who control our mass media. He's been demonized by the Jewish-controlled media, because he broke the Jewish stranglehold over his beloved Fatherland. This talented Aryan genius was a painter, great orator, tactician, and strategist, butmost of all, HE WAS AN Idealist!Our Beloved founder Dr.William Pierce was a visionary, an idealist who put Idealism into action!Dr.William Pierce believed in the righteousness of his cause and he believed in his people, often working an 80+hour week building the National Alliance as a powerful force to counter the Jewish poison of MTV, VH1, and the communistic indoctrination centers of the public school system. Dr.Pierce spoke forcefully about the Terrible Taboo Topics of Today, for that thought crime, he was both feared and vilified by the race destroyers, the race corruptors, the most nefarious race to walk the earth, the Scourge of Humanity, the JEWS!! The National Alliance is the product of Dr.Pierce's Idealism, as members of the National Alliance it is our duty to continue on the righteous path that our beloved founder set forth for his members to follow. We must do whatever is necessary to bring our noble cause to victory! Our Race's future is in our hands and demands our immediate action! We are the most creative race on earth and if we are courageous, no force in the the world can defeat the White Race! We must look deep within ourselves and seek the warrior spirit that our Aryan ancestors possessed. We must be passionate in our mission to awaken the sleeping White giant! We must expose the corrupters of our youth, the nefarious Jews, and their willing collaborators. Remember, the seeds of truth must be sowed before the great harvest, The National Alliance must be our Raison d'etre, our reason for existence. Are you ready fellow comrades for the National Alliance to sweep this nation of the Jewish power structure and reclaim our ancestral homelands? Stand up White men and women, and have the courage of your convictions, Ich Kampf (I Fight) should be our motto.George Orwell aka Eric Blair said eloquently: \"In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\" If, this is indeed true, Then Let the White Revolution begin! Thank you!",

          "content": "During the history of the Aryan race, brave White men and women have fought and died for ideas. The Aryan fighting spirit is Ingrained in our Race soul, it's an integral part of who we are as a race. Take for example: the bravery of Leonidas, the lion's son of http://Sparta.In August 480 BC, Leonidas set out to meet Xerxes's army at Thermopylae with a small, but well-organized and disciplined force of 300, though vastly outnumbered Leonidas exemplified the Aryan traits of Honor, Loyalty and Courage when he died a warrior's death during the Battle of Thermopylae that day. Let's not forget the brave White men who defended the Alamo against the tsunami of Mexicans on March 6,1836, though overwhelmed by the advancing non-white army, they displayed Courage, superior fighting ability, and the Will to Win, even though the odds were against them. These were the men of our race and the same blood is within us all!Idealism is a powerful force, especially in the hearts and minds of intrepid Idealists. I'm reminded of an intrepid idealist, who was born in Austria on April 20th,1889, his great name often invokes instant condemnation from the Bolshevik Beasts who control our mass media. He's been demonized by the Jewish-controlled media, because he broke the Jewish stranglehold over his beloved Fatherland. This talented Aryan genius was a painter, great orator, tactician, and strategist, butmost of all, HE WAS AN Idealist!Our Beloved founder Dr.William Pierce was a visionary, an idealist who put Idealism into action!Dr.William Pierce believed in the righteousness of his cause and he believed in his people, often working an 80+hour week building the National Alliance as a powerful force to counter the Jewish poison of MTV, VH1, and the communistic indoctrination centers of the public school system. Dr.Pierce spoke forcefully about the Terrible Taboo Topics of Today, for that thought crime, he was both feared and vilified by the race destroyers, the race corruptors, the most nefarious race to walk the earth, the Scourge of Humanity, the JEWS!! The National Alliance is the product of Dr.Pierce's Idealism, as members of the National Alliance it is our duty to continue on the righteous path that our beloved founder set forth for his members to follow. We must do whatever is necessary to bring our noble cause to victory! Our Race's future is in our hands and demands our immediate action! We are the most creative race on earth and if we are courageous, no force in the the world can defeat the White Race! We must look deep within ourselves and seek the warrior spirit that our Aryan ancestors possessed. We must be passionate in our mission to awaken the sleeping White giant! We must expose the corrupters of our youth, the nefarious Jews, and their willing collaborators. Remember, the seeds of truth must be sowed before the great harvest, The National Alliance must be our Raison d'etre, our reason for existence. Are you ready fellow comrades for the National Alliance to sweep this nation of the Jewish power structure and reclaim our ancestral homelands? Stand up White men and women, and have the courage of your convictions, Ich Kampf (I Fight) should be our motto.George Orwell aka Eric Blair said eloquently: \"In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\" If, this is indeed true, Then Let the White Revolution begin! Thank you!",

            "description": "This group is based on \"Historical Revisionism\" so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal. That much is obvious!

Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here. We can never have too many backup groups.

          "content": "During the history of the Aryan race, brave White men and women have fought and died for ideas. The Aryan fighting spirit is Ingrained in our Race soul, it's an integral part of who we are as a race. Take for example: the bravery of Leonidas, the lion's son of http://Sparta.In August 480 BC, Leonidas set out to meet Xerxes's army at Thermopylae with a small, but well-organized and disciplined force of 300, though vastly outnumbered Leonidas exemplified the Aryan traits of Honor, Loyalty and Courage when he died a warrior's death during the Battle of Thermopylae that day. Let's not forget the brave White men who defended the Alamo against the tsunami of Mexicans on March 6,1836, though overwhelmed by the advancing non-white army, they displayed Courage, superior fighting ability, and the Will to Win, even though the odds were against them. These were the men of our race and the same blood is within us all!Idealism is a powerful force, especially in the hearts and minds of intrepid Idealists. I'm reminded of an intrepid idealist, who was born in Austria on April 20th,1889, his great name often invokes instant condemnation from the Bolshevik Beasts who control our mass media. He's been demonized by the Jewish-controlled media, because he broke the Jewish stranglehold over his beloved Fatherland. This talented Aryan genius was a painter, great orator, tactician, and strategist, butmost of all, HE WAS AN Idealist!Our Beloved founder Dr.William Pierce was a visionary, an idealist who put Idealism into action!Dr.William Pierce believed in the righteousness of his cause and he believed in his people, often working an 80+hour week building the National Alliance as a powerful force to counter the Jewish poison of MTV, VH1, and the communistic indoctrination centers of the public school system. Dr.Pierce spoke forcefully about the Terrible Taboo Topics of Today, for that thought crime, he was both feared and vilified by the race destroyers, the race corruptors, the most nefarious race to walk the earth, the Scourge of Humanity, the JEWS!! The National Alliance is the product of Dr.Pierce's Idealism, as members of the National Alliance it is our duty to continue on the righteous path that our beloved founder set forth for his members to follow. We must do whatever is necessary to bring our noble cause to victory! Our Race's future is in our hands and demands our immediate action! We are the most creative race on earth and if we are courageous, no force in the the world can defeat the White Race! We must look deep within ourselves and seek the warrior spirit that our Aryan ancestors possessed. We must be passionate in our mission to awaken the sleeping White giant! We must expose the corrupters of our youth, the nefarious Jews, and their willing collaborators. Remember, the seeds of truth must be sowed before the great harvest, The National Alliance must be our Raison d'etre, our reason for existence. Are you ready fellow comrades for the National Alliance to sweep this nation of the Jewish power structure and reclaim our ancestral homelands? Stand up White men and women, and have the courage of your convictions, Ich Kampf (I Fight) should be our motto.George Orwell aka Eric Blair said eloquently: \"In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\" If, this is indeed true, Then Let the White Revolution begin!

          "content": "During the history of the Aryan race, brave White men and women have fought and died for ideas. The Aryan fighting spirit is Ingrained in our Race soul, it's an integral part of who we are as a race. Take for example: the bravery of Leonidas, the lion's son of http://Sparta.In August 480 BC, Leonidas set out to meet Xerxes's army at Thermopylae with a small, but well-organized and disciplined force of 300, though vastly outnumbered Leonidas exemplified the Aryan traits of Honor, Loyalty and Courage when he died a warrior's death during the Battle of Thermopylae that day. Let's not forget the brave White men who defended the Alamo against the tsunami of Mexicans on March 6,1836, though overwhelmed by the advancing non-white army, they displayed Courage, superior fighting ability, and the Will to Win, even though the odds were against them. These were the men of our race and the same blood is within us all!Idealism is a powerful force, especially in the hearts and minds of intrepid Idealists. I'm reminded of an intrepid idealist, who was born in Austria on April 20th,1889, his great name often invokes instant condemnation from the Bolshevik Beasts who control our mass media. He's been demonized by the Jewish-controlled media, because he broke the Jewish stranglehold over his beloved Fatherland. This talented Aryan genius was a painter, great orator, tactician, and strategist, butmost of all, HE WAS AN Idealist!Our Beloved founder Dr.William Pierce was a visionary, an idealist who put Idealism into action!Dr.William Pierce believed in the righteousness of his cause and he believed in his people, often working an 80+hour week building the National Alliance as a powerful force to counter the Jewish poison of MTV, VH1, and the communistic indoctrination centers of the public school system. Dr.Pierce spoke forcefully about the Terrible Taboo Topics of Today, for that thought crime, he was both feared and vilified by the race destroyers, the race corruptors, the most nefarious race to walk the earth, the Scourge of Humanity, the JEWS!! The National Alliance is the product of Dr.Pierce's Idealism, as members of the National Alliance it is our duty to continue on the righteous path that our beloved founder set forth for his members to follow. We must do whatever is necessary to bring our noble cause to victory! Our Race's future is in our hands and demands our immediate action! We are the most creative race on earth and if we are courageous, no force in the the world can defeat the White Race! We must look deep within ourselves and seek the warrior spirit that our Aryan ancestors possessed. We must be passionate in our mission to awaken the sleeping White giant! We must expose the corrupters of our youth, the nefarious Jews, and their willing collaborators. Remember, the seeds of truth must be sowed before the great harvest, The National Alliance must be our Raison d'etre, our reason for existence. Are you ready fellow comrades for the National Alliance to sweep this nation of the Jewish power structure and reclaim our ancestral homelands? Stand up White men and women, and have the courage of your convictions, Ich Kampf (I Fight) should be our motto.George Orwell aka Eric Blair said eloquently: \"In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\" If, this is indeed true, Then Let the White Revolution begin!

Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of those types of “salvation by works” cults and false religions. On the other hand, Titus 3:9-11 is aimed directly at Judaism and contains instructions for those born again regarding those wrapped up in it.  Personally...“I’d rather die believing in The Lord and finding out He’s not real than die not believing in Him and finding out He is...”-Found in Social Media Land then paraphrasedParallels another one:“I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late sounds MUCH better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is...(SIDE NOTE - Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). The Lord is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.",

NCLA is representing Drs. Jayanta Bhattacharya, Martin Kulldorff, and Aaron Kheriaty, as well as Jill Hines, the co-director of Health Freedom Louisiana. Jim Hoft, founder and editor-in-chief of The Gateway Pundit, also joined the lawsuit in August.The deposition was sealed under court order, but participants have shared some of their takeaways on social media.In a Facebook video, Hines discussed what she called some “interesting tidbits” from the deposition, which took place at National Institutes of Health (NIH) headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland.“Our amazing attorney general Jeff Landry sat at the table all day today with his “Real Anthony Fauci” book sitting right in front of him,” she laughed.Robert Kennedy Jr.’s pivotal #1 bestseller, “The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health,” meticulously chronicles the astonishing corruption of the entire public health system under Fauci’s 38-year reign as director of NIAID.Hines said Landry would pick the book up occasionally “and look through it to make sure that everyone in the room—especially on the opposite side of the table—could see what he had in his hand.”Another thing she said she observed that was “interesting but awful at the same time,” was Fauci’s demand that a court reporter seated near him put a mask on.“She had either coughed or cleared her throat—or something—and in the middle of answering a question, Dr. Fauci stops and looks at the court reporter and asks her if she’s got some kind of viral infection. Because he stated, ‘the last thing in the world I want to do is get COVID,'” Hines recalled.“He was there to talk about the ‘life-saving interventions’ [COVID shots] that people were supposedly spreading misinformation about, but here he is, afraid of a court reporter sitting several feet away from him,” she noted.Hines said the court reporter told Fauci she had allergies, not a viral infection, but didn’t mind putting a mask on.“So she sat there the rest of the afternoon, the only one in the room that was masked to appease Dr. Fauci who has had ‘several life-saving interventions,’ as he likes to call them, and actually had COVID twice that we know of,” Hines pointed out. “But he was still very much afraid of catching COVID from the court reporter who was sitting several feet away from him.”What did we discover at the deposition today?!?Fauci is a Karen.",

The bottom line is they realistically have no idea what they’re talking about. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of those types of “salvation by works” cults and false religions. On the other hand, Titus 3:9-11 is aimed directly at Judaism and contains instructions for those born again regarding those wrapped up in it.Personally...“I’d rather die believing in The Lord and finding out He’s not real than die not believing in Him and finding out He is...”-Found in Social Media Land then paraphrasedParallels another one:“I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late sounds MUCH better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is...(SIDE NOTE - Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). The Lord is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L.

It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law.

It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you. It’s more accurate and allowing Him to live in you is more feasible than merely trying to imitate behavior(s).",
          "contentraw": "1 of 2 -<br />There are literally dozens of each, cults and false religions but if you’re born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>biblehub.com/greek/509.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> ), feel free to ignore every single one of them. The bottom line is they realistically have no idea what they’re talking about. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of those types of “salvation by works” cults and false religions. On the other hand, Titus 3:9-11 is aimed directly at Judaism and contains instructions for those born again regarding those wrapped up in it.<br /><br />Personally...<br />“I’d rather die believing in The Lord and finding out He’s not real than die not believing in Him and finding out He is...”<br />-Found in Social Media Land then paraphrased<br /><br />Parallels another one:<br />“I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late sounds MUCH better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is...(SIDE NOTE - Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). The Lord is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)<br /><br />A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.<br /><br />An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). <br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots.
