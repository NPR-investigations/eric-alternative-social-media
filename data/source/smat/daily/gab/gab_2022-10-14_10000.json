The U.S. House committee investigating the January 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol voted unanimously to subpoena former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration’s Treasury Department announced an investigation into Governor Ron DeSantis over his use of funds to transport illegal immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard. I spoke with Retired Special Agent Eric Caron about the CIA and what is known about the \"Biden Crime Family.\" China has been eating Biden’s lunch, openly courting Russia and Iran and snubbing U.S. efforts to close the massive trade gap. And Saudi Arabia all but laughed in the president’s face when he flew there to beg for oil. Why? Because Joe Biden is weak — both physically and politically. I was also joined by Randy L.

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

            "description": "This group is based on \"Historical Revisionism\" so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal.

Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here.

The goal is to be selling its meat on the US market within the year.<\/p><p>The traditional meat and poultry industry reacted strongly to President Joe Biden’s executive order last month on biotechnology and biomanufacturing, which observers say could push federal agencies to allow commercial sales of meat grown from an animal’s cells.<\/p><p><a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/mysticphoeniix\" class=\"mention\">@mysticphoeniix<\/a> <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/Fan1776\" class=\"mention\">@Fan1776<\/a> <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/FEDUPCITIZEN7\" class=\"mention\">@FEDUPCITIZEN7<\/a> <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/karoola\" class=\"mention\">@karoola<\/a> <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/indydee\" class=\"mention\">@indydee<\/a> <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/Apeeples\" class=\"mention\">@Apeeples<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2022/10/13/slaughterless-meat-on-cusp-of-reality-cell-based-steak-chicken-and-fish-are-all-on-the-near-horizon/?utm_source=jeeng\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>geneticliteracyproject.org/2022/10/13/slaught<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">erless-meat-on-cusp-of-reality-cell-based-steak-chicken-and-fish-are-all-on-the-near-horizon/?utm_source=jeeng<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><\/p>",

Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed.

          "content": "The Biden administration opened an investigation into Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s flight of illegal immigrants from the U.S.-Mexico border to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, last month.The Treasury Department’s inspector general confirmed it is evaluating whether DeSantis allegedly misused COVID-19 relief funds to send the illegal aliens to the wealthy liberal hotspot, said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) on Wednesday.A Treasury Department inspector general letter (pdf), dated Oct. 7 and posted by the senator’s office Wednesday, told Markey and other members of Congress that it will evaluate Florida’s COVID-19-related spending. That probe was part of a broader investigation into how states used billions of dollars sent to them under the American Rescue Plan.Richard K. Delmar, the deputy inspector general for the Treasury Department, said it would “review the allowability” of COVID-19 aid to states “related to immigration generally, and will specifically confirm whether interest earned on [the] funds was utilized by Florida related to immigration activities, and if so, what conditions and limitations apply to such use.”“As part of its oversight responsibility for the [State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund], Treasury Office of Inspector General has audit work planned on recipients’ compliance with eligible use guidance,” the letter said. “In addition, as part of our oversight work of the Coronavirus Relief Fund established by the CARES Act, we have already sought information from Florida about appropriate use of that fund.”FlightThat letter came in response to Markey and five House members, who wrote to the inspector general’s office in September to demand an investigation into DeSantis’s plan. About 50 illegal immigrants from Venezuela were shipped to Martha’s Vineyard, and the Florida Republican government took credit for it.Hours after the illegal aliens were sent to the island, the Massachusetts governor’s office deployed the National Guard before sending the illegal immigrants to a military base on Cape Cod.In mid-September, the Florida governor suggested he would send more to Martha’s Vineyard and other areas.“There’s a whole bunch of other places,” Desantis said. “But I would say that all we’re trying to do is offer transport to sanctuary jurisdictions” that are “free to the alien but certainly not mandatory.”EmergencyGovs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona have been busing illegal immigrants to Democrat-controlled areas in protest of what they said is President Joe Biden’s inadequate policing of the U.S.-Mexico border. The City of El Paso, Texas, has also sent thousands to New York City in recent weeks.New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, declared an emergency on Oct. 7 due to the surge of illegal aliens. Abbott has said that places like New York City are “sanctuary cities” and should be able to take them in.“New Yorkers are angry,” said Adams in a news conference. “I am angry too. We have not asked for this. There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers.”A spokeswoman for Abbott dismissed Adams’s declaration when it was issued.“The true emergency is on our nation’s southern border where small Texas border towns are overrun and overwhelmed by hundreds of migrants every single day as the Biden administration dumps them in their communities,” Renae Eze, the spokeswoman, said in a statement.The Epoch Times has contacted DeSantis’s office for comment.https://www.theepochtimes.com/treasury-department-investigating-desantis-illegal-immigrant-flights-to-marthas-vineyard_4792038.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",

About 50 illegal immigrants from Venezuela were shipped to Martha’s Vineyard, and the Florida Republican government took credit for it.<br /><br />Hours after the illegal aliens were sent to the island, the Massachusetts governor’s office deployed the National Guard before sending the illegal immigrants to a military base on Cape Cod.<br /><br />In mid-September, the Florida governor suggested he would send more to Martha’s Vineyard and other areas.<br /><br />“There’s a whole bunch of other places,” Desantis said. “But I would say that all we’re trying to do is offer transport to sanctuary jurisdictions” that are “free to the alien but certainly not mandatory.”<br /><br />Emergency<br /><br />Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona have been busing illegal immigrants to Democrat-controlled areas in protest of what they said is President Joe Biden’s inadequate policing of the U.S.-Mexico border. The City of El Paso, Texas, has also sent thousands to New York City in recent weeks.<br /><br />New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, declared an emergency on Oct. 7 due to the surge of illegal aliens. Abbott has said that places like New York City are “sanctuary cities” and should be able to take them in.<br /><br />“New Yorkers are angry,” said Adams in a news conference. “I am angry too. We have not asked for this. There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers.”<br /><br />A spokeswoman for Abbott dismissed Adams’s declaration when it was issued.<br /><br />“The true emergency is on our nation’s southern border where small Texas border towns are overrun and overwhelmed by hundreds of migrants every single day as the Biden administration dumps them in their communities,” Renae Eze, the spokeswoman, said in a statement.<br /><br />The Epoch Times has contacted DeSantis’s office for comment.<br /><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/treasury-department-investigating-desantis-illegal-immigrant-flights-to-marthas-vineyard_4792038.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theepochtimes.com/treasury-department-investi<span class=\"invisible\">gating-desantis-illegal-immigrant-flights-to-marthas-vineyard_4792038.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Ma inserire qualsiasi connessione di rete su un sistema elettorale apre nuovi modi per attaccarlo che non richiedono l'accesso fisico alle macchine, e gli esperti di sicurezza affermano che i rischi non valgono i premi.\"Stai contando su un mucchio di infrastrutture per fornire dati avanti e indietro, ed è ben all'interno delle capacità degli hacker di stato-nazione di entrare in quell'infrastruttura\", ha affermato Dan Wallach, un professore di informatica della Rice University che ha ripetutamente esposto i difetti nelle apparecchiature elettorali.Sebbene la manomissione dei risultati non ufficiali non danneggerebbe effettivamente l'esito di un'elezione, potrebbe alimentare la disinformazione sia sull'accuratezza del conteggio dei voti che sull'integrità del processo. Questa è una preoccupazione particolare dalle elezioni del 2020, in cui l'allora presidente Donald Trump ha colto grandi discrepanze tra i ritorni anticipati e il conteggio dei voti finali per affermare falsamente una frode diffusa.Almeno sei stati - Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan e Minnesota - utilizzano i modem per trasmettere i risultati in un totale di 36 contee, secondo un sondaggio POLITICO. Il Rhode Island li usa in tutto lo stato e Washington, DC li usa in tutta la città. Il Wisconsin, che il gruppo di integrità elettorale senza scopo di lucro Verified Voting ha identificato come dispositivi dotati di modem, non ha risposto alle domande sul fatto che le sue contee utilizzino la funzione.Sebbene non ci siano state segnalazioni di modem violati nelle elezioni precedenti, le vulnerabilità sono ben note e gli hacker hanno gli strumenti per sfruttarle.E la semplice esistenza di queste vulnerabilità moderne potrebbe rendere più facile per gli alleati di Trump interrompere le elezioni di medio termine e i concorsi futuri con affermazioni di hacking più infondate, affermano alcuni ex funzionari elettorali.\"Nell'attuale atmosfera iperpolarizzata, i modem nelle macchine per il voto non sono ora solo un potenziale obiettivo per attacchi informatici, ma, forse ancora più importante, operazioni di informazione che cercano di mettere in dubbio la legittimità delle elezioni statunitensi\", ha affermato David Levine, ex direttore elettorale per Contea di Ada, Idaho. Ora è un membro dell'Alliance for Securing Democracy che si occupa di questioni di integrità elettorale.\"L'uso del modem espande la superficie della minaccia [che] i funzionari elettorali sono costretti a difendere da tutti i rischi, inclusi cyber, errori operativi, disinformazione e fiabe\", ha affermato Noah Praetz, ex direttore elettorale per la contea di Cook, Ill.La Florida - sede di una serrata corsa al Senato a novembre tra l'incumbent repubblicano Marco Rubio e il democratico Val Demings - utilizza modem in 18 contee, tra cui Broward, la seconda più popolosa.(Continua nei commenti)",

Both are now multi-billionaires who have claimed they support free speech. PayPal apparently no longer shares the principles of their founders. PayPal has flourished from customer online transactions and by means of drawing interest from balances. That’s not enough. PayPal wants more. Namely, power and control.

They claimed that they had paid us a lot of money and therefore ‘owned’ us. It was a nonsensical bluff. Our fans used Patreon to support us and Patreon regularly extracted a large cut. We paid Patreon. They did not pay us a dime. We left that far-left organization by choice. Many are surprised PayPal hasn’t already pulled the plug on us, but maybe it’s because we’ve brought so much business and money their way. Still, it’s probably inevitable that they would eventually fine us for spreading what they call ‘misinformation.’After an outpouring of outrage, PayPal backtracked and claimed their policy to control free speech was a mistake! That’s a howler. Obviously PayPal has a legion of lawyers to look over their policy with a fine-tooth comb. PayPal is not sorry. They’re sorry they got caught.

We paid Patreon. They did not pay us a dime. We left that far-left organization by choice. Many are surprised PayPal hasn’t already pulled the plug on us, but maybe it’s because we’ve brought so much business and money their way. Still, it’s probably inevitable that they would eventually fine us for spreading what they call ‘misinformation.’After an outpouring of outrage, PayPal backtracked and claimed their policy to control free speech was a mistake! That’s a howler. Obviously PayPal has a legion of lawyers to look over their policy with a fine-tooth comb. PayPal is not sorry. They’re sorry they got caught.
