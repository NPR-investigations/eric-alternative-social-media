In 1962, President JFK’s Joint Chief of Staff General L. L. Lemnitzer masterminded the Northwoods plan in order to start a war with Cuba. The American people certainly did not want a war and neither did Castro, so a series of false-flag operations were designed to cause a “helpful wave of indignation” and get the people behind a war. The methods to be employed were many and varied from starting rumors using clandestine radio, to sinking and setting fires to US ships, dressing like Cubans to attack US bases, blowing up ammunition/planes, starting fires/riots, and last but not least, hijacking and shooting down a commercial passenger plane. The document actually says that “Casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of indignation.” They even planned to “conduct funerals for mock victims” to gain added public support if there weren’t enough real victims. All this was already approved and signed by every Joint Chief of Staff and the Secretary of Defense when President John F. Kennedy received it. Thankfully for us all, JFK refused to sign the Northwoods document and the plan was never carried out, but its very existence proves that the government is certainly not always friendly and looking out for our best interests.The following presentation \"Top Secret CIA Declassified Operation Northwoods\" was taken from a chapter in my book \"The Atlantean Conspiracy\" available here:  http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubayGet Connected With Me:Website: http://www.EricDubay.comBlog: http://www.AtlanteanConspiracy.comForum: http://www.IFERS.123.stBooks: http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubayFacebook: https://web.facebook.com/groups/edfes/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericdubaz/Twitter: https://twitter.com/ericdubaySoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/eric-dubay/Mewe: https://mewe.com/i/ericdubayMinds: https://www.minds.com/EricDubayGab: https://gab.ai/Eric-DubayGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/ericdubayYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/c/flatearthericOdysee: https://odysee.com/@EricDubay:cBitChute: https://www.bitchute.com/channel/TCgwKoAf3Y9z/BrandNewTube: https://brandnewtube.com/@EricDubayReal Truthseekers: https://real-truth-seekers.com/@ericdubayRokfin: https://rokfin.com/EricDubayRumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-1286253Dollar Vigilante: https://dollarvigilante.tv/c/eric.dubay/videosTelegram: t.me/flatearthericdubayEmail: ericdubaynewsletter@protonmail.com",

Со всеми рассорится, всё провалит и уйдёт с позором, как и её предшественник – лохматый Бориска. Что ж, в Британии, славящейся своими традициями, кажется, появляется ещё одна.\n\n2. Мужчина с унылым лицом по фамилии Боррель заявил, что Россия – фашистское государство. \n\nЯ бы не стал возвращаться к этому омерзительному заявлению недалёкого комиссара ЕС, но вынужден специально подчеркнуть, что такие вещи забывать нельзя никому и никогда. Этот чиновник должен быть навсегда занесён в списки нерукопожатных существ без права помилования.",

Without explaining why, Weissman asserted, “Kash Patel…needs to really be getting a lawyer.”Peter Strzok, the former deputy assistant director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division who led the investigation into the Trump campaign in 2016, recently suggested Patel was in trouble. “Never great to see your unredacted name in a search warrant affidavit. To borrow from Eric Hirschmann, ‘I’m going to give you the best free legal advice you’re ever getting in your life. Get a great F’ing criminal defense lawyer — you’re going to need it,” he tweeted.David Ignatius, Washington Post columnist — who first reported on the leaked classified contents of a call between then-former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn with a Russian diplomat — recently penned a hit piece on Patel, where he also suggested that Patel would be in trouble. “I fear that a sequel is coming, where Kash and King Donald’s other knights will joust with what they claim are government gangsters — and this won’t be a children’s book,” Ignatius warned ominously.And recently on CNN, former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers claimed Patel is “implicated” in some wrongdoing.",
