However, things didn’t work out quite according to the plan for the takeover of Ukraine, and here is how the war in Ukraine actually began:We’ll open by describing the planning for the conquest of Russia’s key naval base, in Sevastopol in Crimea. Crimea was inside Ukraine during 1954-2014, but had otherwise been inside Russia, going all the way back to 1783. During 1954, the Soviet dictator, Khrushchev, arbitrarily transferred Crimea, from Russia to Ukraine, even though the vast majority of Crimeans considered themselves to be Russians, and their native language was Russian – but, after all, the Soviet Union was a dictatorship. Crimeans had no say in the matter.The U.S. regime prepared for its planned takeover of Crimea by commissioning Gallup to poll Crimeans in 2013 to find out whether the residents there considered themselves to be Ukrainians (which would make the U.S. regime’s job in Crimea easier), or instead still Russians (which would foretell resistance there); and the findings were that Crimeans overwhelmingly still considered themselves to be Russians, definitely not Ukrainians. Nonetheless, the plan for the takeover went forward – the U.S. team, it is clear, decided that the residents of Crimea could be dealt with (http://archive.is/HsWoL), in such ways as is shown here: https://robscholtemuseum.nl/eric-zuesse-how-the-war-in.../",

That is why Putin got so angry.<br />What you see today in Ukraine is a consequence of that 2014 CIA/NATO Coup.<br />You will never find this information on the New York Times, nor on the Washington Post. Forget CNN or Fox News, or MSNBC, ABC, CBS: those are Fake News, Globalist Propaganda puppets. They will never tell you the truth about the 2014 Coup in Ukraine.<br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br />Another important Premium article:<br />“The Biden Cabal and NATO want to trigger World War 3.

In order to do so, the Subcommittee has not only suppressed evidence proving that the fundamental premise of what it terms the “Global Magnitsky movement”—American-born British hedge fund operator William Browder’s account of the 2009 death in custody of his Russian tax advisor Sergei Magnitsky—is a hoax. Incredibly, it has also admitted, almost in so many words, that Browder’s story is so valuable as a political expedient that the Sub-committee doesn’t even care if it is true or not. The fix, as they say, is in: Australia’s one-party colonial government, of which the Labor and Liberal-National parties are merely the left and right wings, is determined to enact the will of its Anglo-American imperial masters, and the truth be damned. The Sub-committee’s 7 December report Criminality, corruption and impunity: Should Australia join the Global Magnitsky movement? is the product of an inquiry initiated by Foreign Minister Senator Marise Payne in December 2019, after Labor Sen. Kimberley Kitching gave notice she intended to introduce a bill for an Australian Magnitsky Act this September (which COVID-related interruptions have now delayed until sometime early next year). Given Canberra officially designated China the enemy in 2016,[1] and that the Australian Security Intelligence Agency (ASIO) has directed an incessant media propaganda campaign accusing China of all manner of human rights abuses—without ever presenting a shred of evidence—ever since,[2] it was immediately clear which country a putative Australian Magnitsky Act would target. Equally clear was that the inquiry would be rigged, given the Sub-committee conducting it was chaired by staunch Anglo-American loyalist and former Minister of Defence Kevin Andrews MP, and stacked with anti-China fanatics including Kitching herself along with Liberals Sen. Eric Abetz and Andrew Hastie MP, all members of the juvenile “Wolverines” parliamentary clique—named after the teenage heroes of the paranoid 1984 Cold War movie Red Dawn—that advocates a new Cold War (or worse) with https://citizensparty.org.au/wilful-disregard-truth-parliaments-magnitsky-act-inquiry-report",
