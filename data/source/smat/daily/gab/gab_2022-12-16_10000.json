We will remove a post according to our interpretation (written by us) of the guidelines below. If there is any confusion, please DM.\n\n***My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” \nEphesians 3:20 TPT\n\n***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\n\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\n\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\n\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it.\n\n ***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else's well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\n\n1. Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\n\n2. Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.\n\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\n\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \n\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\n\n***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\n\n***“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.” Numbers 6:24-27 ESV\n\n***Group Creator:  @Micaiah\nAdmins/Mods: @Shooglenifty, @riustan",

Smith, a valiant, battle-hardened officer who had led Marines into combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.His meritorious accolades are legendary, and Marines revere him.  Afghanistan and Iraq aside, Gen. Smith commanded U.S. Marine Corps Forces Southern Command, 1st Marine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force, and Marine Corps Combat Development Command.More recently, he had helped draft the battle plan that allowed a joint Special Operations task force to seize FEMA’s Mount Weather stronghold.Gen. Smith, who was absent the call, would assume command of all White Hat military operations effective January 1, Gen. Berger said, adding that he’d retain authority in the interim.“General Smith is the right Marine for this job,” General Berger told the council. “Many of you have met him, and know his reputation. The few of you who haven’t will get to know him soon enough. He’s no nonsense. A Marine and a true patriot. He’s gonna shake things up, and you’ll show him the same respect and deference you’ve shown me. I’ll still be around, advising from the lines.

We’ve had a few differences lately, that’s all. My reasons are my own. And I’ll tell you all this, General Smith won’t tolerate quacky tales about a Donald Trump clone or double sitting at Mar-a-Lago, so get your heads on straight. Trump gave us this charge, and you, all of you, answered his call.”In closing, our source said Gen. Berger segued into a brief, heartfelt speech, saying he felt he had served the White Hat community and his president with pride, dignity, and honor, and he implored the council to “keep fighting the good fight, even on the darkest days.”Note: Nancy Pelosi’s tribunal concluded late yesterday afternoon.

They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.)
