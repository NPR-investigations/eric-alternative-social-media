The show explores the artist’s alluring and highly individualized interpretation of childhood. Nura’s modernist approach, acquired from her time in Paris in the 1920s, resulted in stylized images of children whom she portrayed with animals, books, and musical instruments, though rarely with an adult in sight. Nura’s figures are distinguished by their rounded forms, rosy cheeks, and wavy hair. She shows them in ethereal landscapes and indistinct interior settings. Her compositions capture an essence of childhood imbued with innocence and enigma. The Carle is pleased to re-introduce Nura after 70 years away from the public eye.https://carlemuseum.org/explore-art/exhibitions/current-exhibition/finding-nura-rediscovering-american-modernist-kendra-and",

Just my attempt to keep them interesting.  I am not sure how long they will include stories, or with what regularity they may have a story, but for today, here is another one that addresses the text.  In this text Jesus addresses the issue of hearing His word and then acting on it.  It is one thing to know the word in our head, it is entirely another to live the word through our hearts.  The following story illustrates this truth.  This story is based on a Jewish tale.As the Teacher was speaking with a group of children, a soap-maker attempted to embarrass him. “How can you claim that religion is good and valid when there is so much suffering and evil in the world?  What good are all the books and sermons that your religion has produced?”The Teacher motions to a small child to move through the crowd.  “This is Eric,” the Teacher said, “He is three.  He is also dirty.  I ask you, what good is soap when Eric and hundreds of children like him are dirty?  How can you pretend that,” the Teacher answered.  “What a foolish argument,” the soap-maker protested.  “If soap is to be effective it must be used.”  “Precisely,” the Teacher answered.  “If the teachings of our master are to be effective, they must be used.”It has been observed that some folks would rather see a sermon than hear one.  All of us should understand that old adage, actions speak louder than words.",

She’s a former real estate lawyer, caseworker, and seems to have no tech background. Either through negligence or deceit, Bailey can’t find anything! She shields Cox’s communications from all public scrutiny (rhonda@utah.gov).For many of Sophie’s requests, Bailey said the Guv’s email and texts were “publicly accessible”. Other times Bailey lists them as “protected”. This prevent any search from being conducted so the requests are denied. In another example, Sophie asked for messages (text, email, SM) spanning 8 years including words: election(s), absentee ballots, overseas ballots, and so on. DGC Bailey denied the request with the misdirection “we do not maintain records relating to elections”. It’s an insulting response.“No Records Found” is the Governor’s Office most common response. The Moms sensed a rigged game. So they tested GRAMA using a known message involving the Governor. Jennifer provided precise details, between May 11-14th, the singular term “quarantine”, in any of the Governor’s texts or emails. The request was denied multiple times, not “specific enough”. A tourism newsletter that mentioned “quarantine” is what DGC Bailey provided. This proved Governor GRAMA requests are a farce and likely violate Utah laws.This saddest example is when Sophie asked for all coms from 2006-17 with former Governors. Her search terms included key developments during those years, and listed 31 words including “Trump”. Again, the GRAMA was denied with “No Records Found”. It’s absurd to believe none of the 31 words were ever mentioned during those 11 years: (Trump, ES&S, ERIC, Diebold, HAVA, Dominion, Governors Association, ranked choice voting, voter rolls, EAC, Democracy Fund, Rock the Vote, Pew, Tides, CTCL, referendum, NCOA, etc.).",

Tons of environmental/eco-ethical arguments against the all-electric car.  For example, this Car and Driver article asserts, that a hybrid uses 1% of the battery size that the fully electric vehicle uses.  It's much less impact on one's budget, the economy, and the people of environmental source countries that produce the raw elements for batteries, if each car uses 1% of what the all electric cars use.  There is not enough batteries to enable all humans to have fully electric cars.  There is not enough grid power to charge fully electric powered cars.  But a hybrid which can use gas or electric is much more capable of growth and handling large populations.  Furthermore, there is the problem of driving in cold weather (very bad with cars).  Then there is the cost of battery replacement.  Length of the for refueling (hybrids refuel their electric batteries while you drive, which could be initially on gas; all electric vehicles require lengthy times at charging stations).  Quote: \"You might think that the battery pack of any electrified vehicle—hybrid, plug-in hybrid (PHEV), or pure electric (BEV)—is pretty much the same, other than its size. But that overlooks two key differences in the way batteries are used in different types of electrified vehicles. First is the flow of electrical power in and out of the battery relative to its size.

Tons of environmental/eco-ethical arguments against the all-electric car.  <br /><br />For example, this Car and Driver article asserts, that a hybrid uses 1% of the battery size that the fully electric vehicle uses.  It's much less impact on one's budget, the economy, and the people of environmental source countries that produce the raw elements for batteries, if each car uses 1% of what the all electric cars use.  There is not enough batteries to enable all humans to have fully electric cars.  There is not enough grid power to charge fully electric powered cars.  But a hybrid which can use gas or electric is much more capable of growth and handling large populations.  Furthermore, there is the problem of driving in cold weather (very bad with cars).  Then there is the cost of battery replacement.  Length of the for refueling (hybrids refuel their electric batteries while you drive, which could be initially on gas; all electric vehicles require lengthy times at charging stations).  <br /><br />Quote: \"You might think that the battery pack of any electrified vehicle—hybrid, plug-in hybrid (PHEV), or pure electric (BEV)—is pretty much the same, other than its size.

The effect size is 12-sigma. That is an event that would happen by pure chance every 2.8e32 years (as shown in the image below). That’s very rare. It’s basically never.

COVID deaths are down this year.Whatever it is that is causing this, it is bigger and more deadlier than COVID and it’s affecting nearly everyone.The CDC is totally on top of this… ok, just kidding… the CDC is clueless as usual.All of this means that “something” is causing MASSIVE numbers of excess deaths in 2021.I wonder what is killing all these people?Here are the clues we have, so we need someone really smart to piece this mystery together:These deaths started only after the vaccines rolled outThe deaths are “primarily working-age people 18 to 64” who are the employees of companies that have group life insurance plans through OneAmerica.

What’s key is that we’re seeing effects in young people.There are more excess deaths than anytime in history, so it is likely caused by a new threat, never seen before in history, like a novel vaccine that has never been used before or something new like that that a huge number of people would be exposed to (such as by a state that pushes vaccination).Not due to COVID (COVID deaths are way down).They are dying from a variety of causes, not just a single cause. So this rules out food or air-based pathogens. I note that the variety of causes of death is consistent with the wide range of adverse events caused by the COVID vaccines, for example.It has to affect massive numbers of people to get an effect size that high. So it is something new affecting at least half the population, like a new mandated vaccine for example.There is a huge push for vaccines by the Indiana governor, he wants to have everyone vaccinated. Interesting. “Indiana Gov.
