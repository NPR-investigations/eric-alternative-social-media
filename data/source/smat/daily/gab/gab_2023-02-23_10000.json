On the face of things, ERIC is a private organization that helps its 32 member states clean up and maintain their voter rolls.  It compares state voter registration data against motor vehicle licensing information and the Social Security master death file.  Then it tells states which voters are dead, have moved out of state, or are registered to vote in more than one state.  Critics say ERIC is, at root, nothing more than a partisan get-out-the-vote drive for Democrats.   Louisiana withdrew from ERIC last month, citing “concerns raised by citizens, government watchdog organizations and media reports about potential questionable funding sources and that possibly partisan actors may have access to ERIC network data for political purposes.”More recently, Alabama left ERIC.  The new Secretary of State said he did not want a private group having access to voter data, including driver’s license numbers, contact information, and partial social security numbers including those of minors.In addition to partisan connections and privacy concerns, critics also say ERIC does a bad job, producing bloated voter rolls in member states.  Florida, for example, is a member of ERIC but has more than 100 percent of all possible citizens of voting age on its rolls.Critics point to ERIC’s initial funding which was provided by leftist super-hero George Soros.  They also point to an interlocking directorate in the person of David Becker, a high-profile Democrat election lawyer who is the architect of ERIC.  Becker started at the left-wing group People for the American Way and was part of the Obama Justice Department.  He is described as a “hardcore Leftist” who “couldn’t stand conservatives.”  He went on to create the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) which distributed almost $70 million in private Zuckerberg money through official election offices to reach voters primarily in Democrat counties in the 2020 presidential election.  Becker is still a member of ERIC’s board. Lawsuits have been filed against four jurisdictions for allowing ERIC to block public inspection of voter registration records.  ERIC’s contract with states requires them to hide the information from the public, in violation of federal law, the suits allege.ERIC is also the subject of other lawsuits for sharing valuable and detailed voter registration data like phone numbers from four states with at least one outside leftist group, a practice not authorized in federal law.  ERIC requires members to identify and register unregistered voters and - this is the heart of the matter - they all turn out to be likely Democrat voters: minorities, students, etc.  According to the lawsuits, ERIC is shipping voter data to - this will sound familiar - CEIR, the leftist group I mentioned earlier involved in goosing Democrat voter registration with Zuckerbucks.  Critics say ERIC data, developed with taxpayer money, is helping the Democrats microtarget their most likely supporters who are not yet registered to vote.  Conservative activists continue to campaign against ERIC in Michigan, Virginia, and elsewhere.  However, there is a practical problem: finding a good substitute.  People suggest different things, but an obvious alternative has yet to emerge.   When ERIC was created, it displaced a then-new state-run interstate cross-check system for maintaining voter rolls.  State-run systems will be more expensive, but will pay big dividends in terms of election integrity, so they just might be the way to go.",

On Feb 3rd a Norfolk-Southern HAZMAT freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, damaging and releasing the contents of 50 hydrogen chloride and phosgene cars. The governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania then approved of a 2-day “burn-off” of the spilled chemicals, releasing tons of ultra-deadly dioxins into the atmosphere and Ohio River. There was no immediate FEMA response. The testing of the poisoned Ohio River wasn’t conducted by federal government, but by an agency Norfolk-Southern hired to defend their corporate interests. The outrage was so wide-ranging the actions of the Ohio governors, Biden administration, and Norfolk-Southern were deplored from everyone from The Young Turks to Tucker Carlson. On February 15th, NJP commission rep/indy journalist Joseph Jordan (pen name “Eric Striker”)  confronted Ohio Republican congressman Bill Johnson at an East Palestine town hall that night, embarrassing Johnson on camera. Following the confrontation the following ensued (this I’ve taken from Mike Peinovich’s Telegram posts):1. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine mentions FEMA for the first time, saying he is requesting aid and is being denied. For two weeks DeWine said nothing about any such conversations. 2. JD Vance shows up to poke stick in a stream.3. Pedro Gonzalez shows up pretending he had a scoop for revealing that Norfolk Southern backed out of the town hall and says he is making a documentary.4. Bill Johnson directly reverses what he told Striker, that this was not FEMA's job because it wasn't a tornado, and asks for FEMA aid.5. Ohio senators JD Vance and Sherrod Brown issue a bipartisan joint request for FEMA aid.6. Trump makes plans to show up in East Palestine.7. FEMA says they will send aid to East Palestine.And so here in this video Warren and Emily Balogh give you the backstory and rundown of what has since happened, as well as recent efforts on behalf of GOP figureheads DeWine and Trump to try to capitalize on the tragedy for their own political benefit—this, when Trump’s own deregulation policies were partly responsible for Norfolk-Southern negligence, and DeWine co-authorized the calamitous burn-off with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.It is becoming increasingly clear that if you are white and working class, and reside in the general rustbelt area of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, that you have no friends in the Republican Party—only exploiters who themselves act on behest of rich Jewish supremacists. In contrast, groups such as the NJP and Patriot Front—considerably smaller than the Republican Party, and wholly without the hundreds of million$ in funding—will do all they can to defend your interests.

One of his more sinister actions was to back corrupt attorneys in US cities who then promptly began ignoring crime, releasing perpetrators and making US cities less safe.Kim Gardner in St. Louis is a Soros-backed St. Louis Circuit Attorney.  She has been involved in numerous corrupt activities.Gardner was behind the removal of former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens.  She committed 62 acts of misconduct and 79 acts of false reporting in the case.  Greitens resigned as governor as a result but this wasn’t enough for Gardner to resign or Missouri politicians to bring her to justice.In September 2021, Freedom Principle begged Missouri Republican Governor Parson to remove Gardner from prosecuting felony cases based on her record.  Nothing happened.In January a former employee filed a lawsuit against Gardner and her assistant, a contract employee and convicted murderer.Then recently Gardner’s team didn’t show up in court to enforce the law again.  The repeat offender went on to hit a Tennessee volleyball player walking in St. Louis City last week  — and the young girl lost her legs after she was pinned to another car.Finally, Missouri politicians are willing to do something about Gardner.  St. Louis and Missouri residents were livid about the incident.

Horowitz also criticized Lynch for making statements that \"created considerable public confusion\" about her role in the emails investigation, although he said investigators found no evidence the email inquiry was discussed.Sign told Fox News in early 2020 his family received numerous death threats since he broke the story about the meeting in the lead up to the 2016 election. \"My family received significant death threats shortly after breaking this story,\" Sign said at the time. \"Credit cards hacked.

We have secret code words that they know what to do.\"Sign is survived by his wife, Laura, and their three sons.Original Location:&nbsp;Reporter who broke story on Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting found deadBoth Bill Clinton and Lynch claim the email investigation was not brought up during their chat, but Sign, who was a morning anchor at the Phoenix-area ABC15 when he first reported their encounter, said there was more to the story and even wrote a book about it,&nbsp;Secret on the Tarmac.The book \"details everything that they don't want you to know and everything they think you forgot.

May his memory be for blessing,\" ABC 33/40 Vice President and General Manager Eric Land said in a statement.<br /><br />Christopher Sign.<br />Screen shot, courtesy of Fox News.<br />A report released by the Jefferson County Coroner/Medical Examiner’s Office said Sign was found unresponsive by family members at his home in Hoover, according to the Trussville Tribune. <br /><br />Christopher Sign.

According The report also said Sign was pronounced dead at the residence at 8:25 a.m. A cause of death has not been disclosed as of Monday evening.<br /><br />Sign wrote a book about his experience called Secret on the Tarmac.<br /><br /><br />G<br />Sign also won a 2014 Emmy Award for breaking news for his coverage of the shooting of two Phoenix police officers, as well as an Edward R. Murrow Award for spot news, for his coverage of the search for the “Baseline Killer” and “Serial Shooter” who terrorized Phoenix in the summer of 2016.<br /><br /><br />Sign attended the University of Alabama in the 1990s and spent four years as an offensive lineman for the Crimson Tide under former coach Gene Stallings.<br /><br /><br />While at Alabama, he met his wife, Laura, an All-SEC volleyball player. The couple has three sons.<br /><br />Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz examined the tarmac meeting as part of a review of the FBI's emails investigation. In a report released in June 2018, Horowitz said Clinton was in Phoenix for \"several campaign events, including a roundtable discussion with Latino leaders and a campaign fundraiser, and his plane was preparing to depart\" when he crossed paths with Lynch, whose plane had just arrived. Horowitz also criticized Lynch for making statements that \"created considerable public confusion\" about her role in the emails investigation, although he said investigators found no evidence the email inquiry was discussed.<br />Sign told Fox News in early 2020 his family received numerous death threats since he broke the story about the meeting in the lead up to the 2016 election. \"My family received significant death threats shortly after breaking this story,\" Sign said at the time. \"Credit cards hacked. You know, my children, we have code words. We have secret code words that they know what to do.\"<br />Sign is survived by his wife, Laura, and their three sons.<br />Original Location:&nbsp;Reporter who broke story on Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting found dead<br /><br /><br /><br />Both Bill Clinton and Lynch claim the email investigation was not brought up during their chat, but Sign, who was a morning anchor at the Phoenix-area ABC15 when he first reported their encounter, said there was more to the story and even wrote a book about it,&nbsp;Secret on the Tarmac.<br />The book \"details everything that they don't want you to know and everything they think you forgot. But Bill Clinton was on that plane for 20 minutes, and it wasn't just about golf, grandkids, and Brexit,\" Sign&nbsp;said on&nbsp;Fox &amp; Friends&nbsp;in February 2020. \"There's so much that doesn't add up.\"",
