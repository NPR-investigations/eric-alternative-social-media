Designed by activists in 2014, it is a membership organization established to maintain states’ voter rolls.  Please don’t misunderstand.  Legitimate maintenance of voter rolls, although required of every state by law, was not the intent of ERIC.Eleven blue states joined the first year, 2014.  Membership was up to 22 states by 2017, which was the last year that it published an annual report.  By 2022, 31 states – some red and some blue! – were a part of the Center.ERIC’s advertised purpose at its outset was to provide states a system of voter roll management.   Provision of this data to the public is something  that the Democrat Party has fought against for decades, since the NVRA (“motor voter” act)  became federal law in 1993.  That Act allows public inspection of “voter list maintenance records”  – which has, of course, become hugely contentious since the blatant election fraud took place in 2020.  ERIC is a voluntary membership organization which charges each member $25,000 annual membership fee – for its services.Each member state is mandated by the ERIC bylaws, to submit ALL details on every voter, both active and inactive, to ERIC every 60 days.  Along with this, states must give over all data from their motor vehicle registration divisions.  This provides ERIC the information on everyone with a drivers license or even a learner’s permit PLUS all ID recipients which include illegals, elderly shut-ins, etc.  For this, ERIC then gives each member state a targeted list of all those NOT registered to vote, and requires that the state contact a  minimum of 95% of these people within 90 days,  soliciting them to register.  https://americanpolicy.org/2022/02/25/eric-the-electronic-registration-information-center-a-dream-database-for-voter-fraud/",

In reality, it is a massive data-gathering operation which adds bogus “voters” to the system of every member state. Millions of inactive, ineligible and “phantom” voters with undeliverable addresses appear on member states’ voter rolls. These names are used for mail-in ballot fraud, ballot box stuffing and machine adjustments in real time.<br /><br />ERIC was started in 2012 using Soros funds donated through the Pew Charitable Trust. It was conceived and organized by a highly unethical leftist named David Becker, who has spent a lifetime trying to defeat the conservative agenda in America.”<br /><br />ERIC is a key component of the Democrats’ voter fraud operation that you may not be aware of.

The physical steps &amp; procedures of making these would take a year or two.

Do you honestly think that Eric Trump really thinks that differently than his dad? These injections were ready and waiting to be pushed onto an unsuspecting public. The election was stolen just so they could install a puppet that would not put up any resistance.

We are fighting back to ensure the rule of law and prevent the government from unconstitutional banning, chilling, and stifling of speech.”Now, Missouri and Louisiana are detailing in a joint statement some of what they have uncovered in the suit so far, and it spells big trouble for the Biden Administration, according to Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt.“We have already received a number of documents that clearly prove that the federal government has an incestuous relationship with social media companies and clearly coordinate to censor freedom of speech, but we’re not done,” Schmitt said.”The Department of Justice is cowering behind executive privilege and has refused to turn over communications between the highest-ranking Biden Administration officials and social media companies. That’s why, yesterday, we asked the Court to compel the Department of Justice to produce those records. We’re just getting started – stay tuned.”The joint statement called it a vast “Censorship Enterprise.” It explained that the DOJ provided the two states with information pursuant to the suit, identifying 45 federal officials who have interacted with social media companies on misinformation. But on top of that, Meta identified 32 additional federal officials, including White House officials, who communicated with them; YouTube also identified 11 federal officials, including White House officials, many of whom were not disclosed by the DOJ.The joint statement continues, “The discovery provided so far demonstrates that this Censorship Enterprise is extremely broad, including officials in the White House, HHS, DHS, CISA, the CDC, NIAID, and the Office of the Surgeon General; and evidently other agencies as well, such as the Census Bureau, the FDA, the FBI, the State Department, the Treasury Department, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. And it rises to the highest levels of the U.S. Government, including numerous White House officials. Defendants have objected to producing some of the most relevant and probative information in their possession.”A senior FB official sent an email to the Surgeon General stating, “I know our teams met today to better understand the scope of what the White House expects from us on misinformation going forward.” This email chain follows the SG’s “misinformation health advisory” in July 2021.",
