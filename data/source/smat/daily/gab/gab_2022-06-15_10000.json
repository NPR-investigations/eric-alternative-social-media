This thing has ‚ÄòSpiritual Cyanide‚Äô written ALL OVER it.‚Äù<br /><br />There are no contradictions in The Word...EVER.<br /><br />Sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included. No one is perfect and there is no one righteous...AT ALL (Isaiah 64:6, John 8:7, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:21-26, 1 John 1:8-10). According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them (see also Jude 1:23). EVERYONE needs a savior.<br /><br />‚Äú...and the truth shall set you free‚Äù (John 8:31-32).",

The average house is equipped with 100 amp service. On our small street (approximately 25 homes), the electrical infrastructure would be unable to carry more than three houses with a single Tesla each. For even half the homes to have electric vehicles, the system would be wildly over-loaded.This is the elephant in the room with electric vehicles. Our residential infrastructure cannot bear the load. So, as our genius elected officials promote this nonsense, not only are we being urged to buy these things and replace our reliable, cheap generating systems with expensive new windmills and solar cells, but we will also have to renovate our entire delivery system! This later \"investment\" will not be revealed until we're so far down this dead end road that it will be presented with an   'OOPS...!' and a shrug.If you want to argue with a green person over cars that are eco-friendly, just read the following. Note: If you ARE a green person, read it anyway. It's enlightening.Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, \"For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine.\" Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran  on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity.I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery. $18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery. Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 Mpg = $0.10 per mile.  The gasoline powered car costs about $25,000 while the Volt costs $46,000 plus. So the Canadian Government wants loyal Canadians not to do the math, but simply pay twice as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run, and takes three times longer to drive across the country.WAKE UP NORTH AMERICA!!!!!!!",

So, as our genius elected officials promote this nonsense, not only are we being urged to buy these things and replace our reliable, cheap generating systems with expensive new windmills and solar cells, but we will also have to renovate our entire delivery system! This later \"investment\" will not be revealed until we're so far down this dead end road that it will be presented with an   'OOPS...!' and a shrug.<br />If you want to argue with a green person over cars that are eco-friendly, just read the following. Note: If you ARE a green person, read it anyway. It's enlightening.<br />Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, \"For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine.\" Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran  on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.<br />It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.<br />According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity.<br />I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery. $18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery. Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 Mpg = $0.10 per mile.  <br />The gasoline powered car costs about $25,000 while the Volt costs $46,000 plus. So the Canadian Government wants loyal Canadians not to do the math, but simply pay twice as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run, and takes three times longer to drive across the country.<br />WAKE UP NORTH AMERICA!!!!!!!",
