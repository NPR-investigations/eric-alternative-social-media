            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180Â° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180Â° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Want a date with a 14 year old girl?  Move to Florida.  Want to be a White Christian White Supremacist?  Move to Florida.  I still have that image of Ron DeSantis wearing his Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader boots when he was touring the damage Hurricane Ian did.  Fashion statement.When a guy says to you;  \"I am not wearing a tin foil hat\",  whose last  name is Trump,   after he gives a speech usually means he just left it in  his car.   According to Eric Bat Shit Crazy Trump, who has been making the rounds at every QAnon meeting he can get to,  did it again,  and boy this time he told a Whopper!Did you know those evil Democrats  want to destroy Christianity?  And families?  Our children?  And history? Gee,  we did not know that.  Last Thanksgiving there were more than 300 QAnon idiots camping out on Dealey Plaza in Dallas, TX because they said without a doubt,  100%, for certain,  that JFK and JFK Jr. would be appearing there and lead Donald Trump back into the white house!  And then,  they did not show up.  Because they both have a chronic case of being dead.  And there was Eric Dumb Ass Trump again making a complete fool out of himself. Wonder what his kids think of him?  Does his family keep the 300 foot roll of aluminum foil in their house?  Dems don't want to kill all children, just enough to make Andrenalchrome so they can live forever!!  Whatever.In the Phoenix,  AZ newspaper, which is quite conservative,  even they are saying people who live there are nuts.  Between a bunch of militia wanna-bees running around, hanging out at polling boxes,  looking like silly little Halloween boys, to Kari Lake telling her fans; \"so what if I have no experience in politics,  I want to rule the world!\".  Arizona has always struck me as being a creepy place.  I had to stop in Gila Bend, AZ one time while traveling from LA to El Paso, and in the gas station was a sign that read;  our gas prices are cheaper because we will never give the feds one dime in tax money, and we do not accept credit cards!  The 4 guys at the counter looked like the hillbillies from the movie Delivance.  Creep show.  Hey!  Where do you want to live?  In the frigging desert where it gets to 130 degrees on a regular basis.  Cooks their brains.Speaking of Arizona;   A few years ago the Saudi's came to Arizona and bought up 3,000,000 acres of farm and ranch land to grow alfalfa and cattle.  Nobody said a word about it back in 2010 because it was right after the housing bubble burst in 2009, and those land owners thought they made a killing by selling their land for 5 times more than it was really worth.  But now?  In La Paz county,  AZ about 100 miles West of Phoenix where most of that Saudi owned land is,  all the wells are running dry.  And those very same Saudi land owners are taking water out of the Colorado River at alarming levels now.While the local politicians there in La Paz County  count the money the Arabs give them every month so they don't bitch.  And to add insult to injury,  all that beef and alfalfa they grow?  Goes straight back to Saudi Arabia via ships leaving out of  Long Beach,  CA.  None of it stays in the US.  First the Saudis had their guys fly planes into the twin towers in 2001,  then they rolled into Arizona and screwed everyone there. When will we learn?Oprah Winfrey has officially endorsed  John Fetterman in PA for US Senate.  Against the wishes of Dr. \"Facelift\"  Oz's campaign.  The bizarro thing about this is Oprah invented Dr. Oz.  If it wasn't for her, none of us would of ever heard his name, unless you were stupid enough to purchase some of his vitamin supplements.CNN is becoming hysterical now.  Chris Cizzilla and some others there claim the race for governor of New York might be going to the GOP!!!  Help Help!  Then we read the latest polling data from companies like 538 Polls which shows  Hochul with the same 9 pt lead she has had for over 2 months!   Hysteria silliness.  Even after John Fetterman gave a very bad debate performance,  voters in PA still love him anyway.  Dr. Oz according to only one Republican poll is ahead in PA.   Marist College polling companynm(rated A+ for accuracy),   who polls registered voters only,  just released their last polls before Tuesday, and they have Fetterman up by 6 pts.   3 other polling companies with only a 67% reliabilty rating say Dr. Oz is ahead by 2 pts.

The bottom line is they realistically have no idea what theyâre talking about.

Christianity doesnât teach anything like either âsalvation by worksâ or âreligionâ (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is âJust Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anythingâ. (âThe Gospel ONLYâ, in other words â Keyword: âONLYâ). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). Weâre under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law.

Psalm 118:8 implies that itâs better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.(SIDE NOTE - The term âChristâ is a title, not a name. It means either âThe Anointed Oneâ or âMessiahâ.)Rather than ask, âWhat would Jesus do?â Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you.
