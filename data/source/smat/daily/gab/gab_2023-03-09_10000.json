            "description": "45th President Donald Trump has called on Republican governors to “pull out of ERIC,” a voter registration system utilized by 31 states and Washington, D.C. that received funding from George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. The former president also called upon the governors to push for their states to return to same day voting with paper ballots, as well as voter ID, following a series of reports from The Gateway Pundit. “All Republican Governors should immediately pull out of ERIC, the terrible Voter Registration System that ‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up. It is a fools game for Republicans,” said former President Trump. “And while these Governors are at it, GO TO SAME DAY VOTING, ALL PAPER BALLOTS, AND VOTER I.D. (VOTER IDENTIFICATION). Mail-In Voting ONLY for FAR AWAY MILITARY and those that are VERY SICK! PROBLEMS ON ELECTION’S SOLVED!” wrote the 45th president. Trump dances on stage at a rally in Arizona (Gage Skidmore / Flickr) According to The Gateway Pundit, the Democrat Party supported preventing states from cleaning up their voter registration rolls, prompting liberal activists in 2010 to create the Electronic Registration Information Center, a “left wing voter registration drive disguised as a voter roll clean up.” “Obviously, ERIC is not working.  The ERIC system is obsolete, inefficient, and has failed in its purpose.  The Democrat party apparatus loves it for some reason,” reported the Gateway Pundit. “The ERIC system is now used in dozens of states despite the fact that voter rolls in those states are more bloated with phantom voters than ever before in US history.” Proponents of the ERIC claim the registration system has been used to “help member states maintain accurate lists of registered voters by sharing data that allows officials to identify and remove people who have died or moved to other states,” and also “help states identify and ultimately prosecute people who vote in multiple states.” Separate reports have also claimed that the system is at the center of “election conspiracies.” The former president’s remarks about the ERIC system come on the heels of his 2023 CPAC speech, in which he vowed to “totally obliterate the deep state.” “The Republican party was ruled by freaks, neocons, open border zealots and fools,” said Trump. “We’re never going back to the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove, and Jeb Bush.” President Trump At CPAC “I am your warrior, I am your justice, and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.” “I will totally obliterate the Deep State.” pic.twitter.com/sMYS5bCtsc — The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle) March 4, 2023  “In 2016, I declared I am your voice. Today I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice, and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” Trump stated. Follow Andrew on Twitter @whiteaf5.  Spread the love",

Biden) Bideni administratsiooni, sealhulgas Bideni enda, Anthony Fauci, sisejulgeolekuministeeriumi ja  ligi tosin föderaalametit ja sekretäri. Hagis väidetakse, et Deep State (alaline haldusosariik) on teinud suuri koordineeritud jõupingutusi koostöös Big Techiga, et tsenseerida ja manipuleerida ameeriklasi – alates tavakodanikest kuni uudisteväljaanneteni – sellistes küsimustes nagu Hunter Bideni sülearvuti põrgust, 2020. aasta valimiste ausus, COVID-  19 päritolu ja ulatuslik skeptitsism, COVID-19 vaktsiini skeptitsism, muu hulgas. Juunis hakkas The Gateway Pundit abistama Missouri AG Schmitti meeskonda ja esitama kriitilisi tõendeid Gateway Punditi Facebooki ja Twitteri tsensuuri kohta kõigis nendes küsimustes. Juhtum jõudis juulis OLULISE pöördepunktini, kui AG Schmitt ja tema meeskond saavutasid tohutu võidu. Nad veensid föderaalkohtunikku andma neile ENNE kohut piiratud  uurimisvolitused. See võimaldas AG Schmittil sundida valitsust JA FACEBOOKI JA TWITTERI ning mõnda muud sotsiaalmeedia platvormi edastama valitsuse ja sotsiaalmeedia platvormide vahel vahetatud dokumente ja suhtlust, milles arutati tsensuuri. Augustis teatasime, et TGP-st pärit Jim Hoftist sai valitsusevastase hagi juhtiv valitsusväline hageja. Sellest ajast peale on AG Schmitti meeskond pidanud nõutud dokumentide üleandmiseks valitsuse ja Big Techi sluug-festi. Ei valitsus ega Big Tech ei taha avaldada nende vastu suunatud hukatuslikke tõendeid ja nad on võidelnud selle avalikustamise peatamiseks. Sellest ajast saadik on paljud valitsusametnikud, sealhulgas dr Tony Fauci, tagandatud ja kohtuasjas tunnistusi andnud. Ja endisest Missouri peaprokurörist Eric Schmidtist sai Missourist pärit USA senaator.  Uus Missouri AG Andrew Bailey asus juhtima, kui Eric Schmidt kontorist lahkus. Terry A. Doughty, USA Louisiana lääneringkonna peakohtunik, juhib juhtumit.  Valitsus on selle juhtumi pärast ilmselgelt väga mures. ESMASPÄEVAL, 6. märtsil 2023 esitasid&nbsp;Missouri ja Louisiana ulatusliku kokkuvõtte juhtumis seni leitud tõenditest ja täiendava esialgse ettekirjutuse. Faktide leidmise kokkuvõte on tähelepanuväärne, kuna see on seni kõige põhjalikum kokkuvõte , milles kirjeldatakse fašistlikku, kogu valitsust hõlmavat vandenõu Big Techiga, et suruda maha kõne ja mõtted COVID-19 hullumeelsuse, 2020. aasta valimiste ja muust pärast seda. Kokkuvõte on seni võimsaim süüdistus oligarhiale föderaalvalitsuse vastiku kampaania raames avalikkuse tahte õõnestamiseks, manipuleerimiseks ja kontrollimiseks. Dokumendis on 364 lehekülge. Eeldatavasti teeb kohtunik Doughty lähinädalatel otsuse Missouri / Louisiana esialgse ettekirjutuse kohta. https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/03/massive-trove-of-documents-filed-in-missouri-louisiana-suit-against-biden-administration/",

In my opinion all of this could have been avoided by just doing what the officer asked. Hell even a $100.00 fine would be less than what happened.Bodycam footage released of 5 Utah cops firing into BMW, killing non-compliant 25-yr-old at traffic stopFarmington Police in Utah have released disturbing bodycam footage of a March 1 traffic stop that ended with five officers opening fire on a BMW and the shooting death of 25-year-old Chase Allan.Allan was pulled over for having an “illegitimate” license plate on his blue BMW — a plate that featured a symbol that was unknown to the police.Allan, the footage reveals, was non-compliant with the first officer’s request for identification and, later, a request to exit the vehicle.The officer informs Allan that he was stopped because his vehicle lacked registration.“So, here’s the deal man,” the officer can be heard saying. “I’m stopping you because there’s no registration on your vehicle, and I’m requesting your identification.”You are detained at this time,” he tells Allan, “and you are not free to leave.”After Allan declines to provide identification, citing various codes and refusing to answer questions, the officer calls for backup.“You can provide your identification to me and we can have a conversation about the laws you have broken or you can fail to identify to me and we can go that route, too,” the officer told the suspect. “I’m perfectly OK with either one you want to go, but the direction this encounter goes is 100 percent in your hands.”Allan then gave to police what they said appeared to be a U.S. passport, ABC4  reports. When the officer thanked him by name, Allan can be heard saying, “That is not me,” leading to the officer asking if the passport was a fake and requesting that he get out of the car.“No, I’m not required to,” Allan replied. “If you try to force me, then we’re going to have issues.”Another officer tells Allan, “If you don’t step out of the car, we’re going to break the window and pull you out.”The video then shows Allan shifting his phone from his right hand to his left as officers open the car door. Allan’s right hand appears to reach in the direction of his right hip, where his seatbelt release is located, revealing a holster and a gun.An officer yells “Gun!” repeatedly, and the five cops open fire, killing Chase.“The gun can later be clearly seen out of its holster on the ground near the driver’s seat,” according to ABC.In a press conference, Farmington Police Chief Eric Johnson defended his officers’ response to Allan’s refusal to get out of his car but stopped short of saying whether he felt the deadly shooting was justified.“The gun can later be clearly seen out of its holster on the ground near the driver’s seat,” according to ABC.In a press conference, Farmington Police Chief Eric Johnson defended his officers’ response to Allan’s refusal to get out of his car but stopped short of saying whether he felt the deadly shooting was justified.“The gun can later be clearly seen out of its holster on the ground near the driver’s seat,” according to ABC.In a press conference, Farmington Police Chief Eric Johnson defended his officers’ response to Allan’s refusal to get out of his car but stopped short of saying whether he felt the deadly shooting was justified.",
