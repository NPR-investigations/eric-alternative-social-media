            "description": "by WorldTribune Staff, October 1, 2021\r\n\r\nAttorney Sidney Powell announced last week that her legal team had been granted the opportunity by a Colorado court to depose Dominion Voting Systems security director Eric Coomer.\r\n\r\nPowell’s team was granted questions in a deposition on Sept. 23. Coomer was reportedly deposed for about an hour.\r\n\r\nBut, thanks to Judge Marie Avery Moses, Coomer’s testimony has yet to be revealed. One day after the deposition, Judge Moses issued a protective order, effectively sealing the transcript.\r\n\r\nA source told Gateway Pundit: “The Judge issued this order sua sponte, which means that no one asked her to do this. She just did it on her own the day after Coomer gave a train-wreck deposition in which he was very clearly emotionally unstable, arrogant, and repeatedly failed to give direct answers to questions. He was clearly playing games and his testimony is simply not credible.”\r\n\r\nCoomer sued several Trump supporters, media outlets and media personalities following the 2020 presidential election, including Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Michelle Malkin, Joe Oltmann, The Gateway Pundit and Jim Hoft, among others.\r\n\r\nThe media is now blocked from downloading Coomer’s testimony.\r\n\r\nJudge Moses ruled that Coomer’s deposition “should be protected from disclosure outside of these proceedings at this time and until otherwise modified by subsequent order of the Court.”\r\n\r\nIn early October of 2020, a week before early voting started in Georgia, 11 Alive news reported that Dominion updated all the voting machines in the state: The state told us last week that the update was routine. But the sheer scope of the update of the state’s 34,000 or so voting machines is what’s raising eyebrows. The biggest update occurred last week at Fulton County’s voter warehouse in northwest Atlanta. Critics have filed suit to scuttle the voting machine because they say the update is more than Georgia’s 159 counties can safely handle.\r\n\r\nGateway Pundit reported at the time that Coomer was the individual who updated the machines.\r\n\r\nIn GA, during (late?) Sept, Dominion’s radical Leftist Eric Coomer made a “critical software change” to GA’s Dominion voting machines “without adequate testing or certification from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission”.

            "description": "by WorldTribune Staff, October 1, 2021\r\n\r\nAttorney Sidney Powell announced last week that her legal team had been granted the opportunity by a Colorado court to depose Dominion Voting Systems security director Eric Coomer.\r\n\r\nPowell’s team was granted questions in a deposition on Sept. 23. Coomer was reportedly deposed for about an hour.\r\n\r\nBut, thanks to Judge Marie Avery Moses, Coomer’s testimony has yet to be revealed. One day after the deposition, Judge Moses issued a protective order, effectively sealing the transcript.\r\n\r\nA source told Gateway Pundit: “The Judge issued this order sua sponte, which means that no one asked her to do this. She just did it on her own the day after Coomer gave a train-wreck deposition in which he was very clearly emotionally unstable, arrogant, and repeatedly failed to give direct answers to questions. He was clearly playing games and his testimony is simply not credible.”\r\n\r\nCoomer sued several Trump supporters, media outlets and media personalities following the 2020 presidential election, including Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Michelle Malkin, Joe Oltmann, The Gateway Pundit and Jim Hoft, among others.\r\n\r\nThe media is now blocked from downloading Coomer’s testimony.\r\n\r\nJudge Moses ruled that Coomer’s deposition “should be protected from disclosure outside of these proceedings at this time and until otherwise modified by subsequent order of the Court.”\r\n\r\nIn early October of 2020, a week before early voting started in Georgia, 11 Alive news reported that Dominion updated all the voting machines in the state: The state told us last week that the update was routine. But the sheer scope of the update of the state’s 34,000 or so voting machines is what’s raising eyebrows. The biggest update occurred last week at Fulton County’s voter warehouse in northwest Atlanta. Critics have filed suit to scuttle the voting machine because they say the update is more than Georgia’s 159 counties can safely handle.\r\n\r\nGateway Pundit reported at the time that Coomer was the individual who updated the machines.\r\n\r\nIn GA, during (late?) Sept, Dominion’s radical Leftist Eric Coomer made a “critical software change” to GA’s Dominion voting machines “without adequate testing or certification from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission”.

He supports his ideas with meticulously verifiable facts, so that his conclusions are irresistible to thinking mind.<br /><br />This statement is particularly powerful, because it is fair and true: “All Muslims, whether they say it or not, consider jihadists to be good Muslims.”<br /><br />This is why Muslims CANNOT be trusted to be fair-minded about jihad … they deeply approve of jihad … and more deeply than they are prepared to admit.<br /><br />Eric Zemmour shows us how shallow and insincere Macron has been about the problem of jihadism. Macron has been lying about jihad for years, as if lying about it could sweep it away.<br /><br />I applaud Zemmour for calling a halt to the cowardly denialism concerning jihad that has afflicted French intellectuals for the last 30 years.”",

            "description": "by WorldTribune Staff, October 1, 2021\r\n\r\nAttorney Sidney Powell announced last week that her legal team had been granted the opportunity by a Colorado court to depose Dominion Voting Systems security director Eric Coomer.\r\n\r\nPowell’s team was granted questions in a deposition on Sept. 23. Coomer was reportedly deposed for about an hour.\r\n\r\nBut, thanks to Judge Marie Avery Moses, Coomer’s testimony has yet to be revealed. One day after the deposition, Judge Moses issued a protective order, effectively sealing the transcript.\r\n\r\nA source told Gateway Pundit: “The Judge issued this order sua sponte, which means that no one asked her to do this. She just did it on her own the day after Coomer gave a train-wreck deposition in which he was very clearly emotionally unstable, arrogant, and repeatedly failed to give direct answers to questions. He was clearly playing games and his testimony is simply not credible.”\r\n\r\nCoomer sued several Trump supporters, media outlets and media personalities following the 2020 presidential election, including Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Michelle Malkin, Joe Oltmann, The Gateway Pundit and Jim Hoft, among others.\r\n\r\nThe media is now blocked from downloading Coomer’s testimony.\r\n\r\nJudge Moses ruled that Coomer’s deposition “should be protected from disclosure outside of these proceedings at this time and until otherwise modified by subsequent order of the Court.”\r\n\r\nIn early October of 2020, a week before early voting started in Georgia, 11 Alive news reported that Dominion updated all the voting machines in the state: The state told us last week that the update was routine. But the sheer scope of the update of the state’s 34,000 or so voting machines is what’s raising eyebrows. The biggest update occurred last week at Fulton County’s voter warehouse in northwest Atlanta. Critics have filed suit to scuttle the voting machine because they say the update is more than Georgia’s 159 counties can safely handle.\r\n\r\nGateway Pundit reported at the time that Coomer was the individual who updated the machines.\r\n\r\nIn GA, during (late?) Sept, Dominion’s radical Leftist Eric Coomer made a “critical software change” to GA’s Dominion voting machines “without adequate testing or certification from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission”.

The problem is MARKETING. I'm seeing the best minds wasted on trying to beg pennies for rent. I just had enough and told the engineering geniuses they can't do math. Eric Dollard probably wants me dead. I have only a warm spot for him, having shared the unpleasantness of only having math and no money.  He found his way out of penury to internet existence.

For me on July 4th 2017 all it took was several examples of number 5 and NASA caught lying about everything they do for me to stop being a Glober and declare independence from all lies that have manipulated me. The rest is just icing on the cake. And there are hundreds more all backed up and verified by the Bible and millions of flat earthers thanks to <a href=\"https://gab.com/Eric-Dubay\" class=\"u-url mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@Eric-Dubay<\/a> videos (who Youtube just censored again recently and continues to censor) so ask yourself why is flat earth a threat if it is complete hogwash? Why do we continue to proselyte more globers to become flat earthers? What if you are wrong? I wasn’t scared to admit this because by 2017 I had already admitted to myself that Mormonism and 9/11 and moon landing, etc. were all clever lies, forgeries, and inside jobs, and then I discovered so many other things that I thought were true were not as they were taught me growing up and as they said on the TV news. They were all a lie. All of it. So you globers that are jumping straight to flat earth after not questioning anything else in your life, of course you aren’t going to be ready for flat earth. It’s a process of questioning and admitting to yourself alone at the end of the day, Could I be deceived? Could I be wrong? And if I’m wrong what would it take to convince me that I’m wrong? Ask yourself. You have nothing to lose but lies that chain you down. 🙏💯⛓💥 And if you are atheist still because of believing the globe NASA religion, discover the Creator of the flat earth and the firmament, even the true God, that they have been trying to hide from you all along. He is much closer above your than you think and not fake “light years” away! ☝️",

MOVE FREELY, COME LORD! IN JESUS NAME. WE WANT YOU GOD! Precious Holy Spirit, have your way. We surrender to who you are. \n\n1 Cor. 12:27-31\nYou, then, are the body of Christ. Every one of you is a member of it. Furthermore, God has set-up in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle-workers, healers, assistants, administrators, and those who speak in tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles or have the gift of healing? Do all speak in tongues, all have the gift of interpretation of tongues? Set your hearts on the greater gifts.\n1 Cor. 13:1-13 \nNow I will show you the way which surpasses all the others. If I speak with human tongues and Angelic as well, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal, if I have the gift of Prophecy and, with full knowledge, comprehend all Mysteries, if I have faith great enough to move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give everything I have to feed the poor and hand over my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient; love is kind. Love is not jealous, it does not put on airs, it is not snobbish. Love is never rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not prone to anger; neither does it brood over injuries. Love does not rejoice in what is wrong but rejoices with the truth. There is no limit to Love's forbearance, to its trust, it's hope, its power to endure. Love Never Fails. Prophecies will cease, tongues will be silent, knowledge will pass away. Our knowledge is imperfect and our prophesying is imperfect. When the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. When I was a child I used to talk like a child, think like a child, reason like a child. When I became a man I put childish ways aside. Now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. My knowledge is imperfect now; then I shall know even as I am known. There are in the end three things that last: faith, hope, and love, and the greatest of these is love.",

He is currently being held at the Wake County Jail on $1.9 million bond.<br /><br /><br />Under questioning, Cazares admitted to sexually assaulting both children.<br /><br /><br />*Since taking office on December 3, 2018, Wake County Sheriff Gerald M. Baker has refused to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and has released many dangerous criminals back into his county, despite requests from ICE to hold them.<br /><br /><br />View this suspect’s booking info... <br /><br /><br /><br />  <a href=\"https://www.illegalaliencrimereport.com/post/illegal-alien-arrested-on-child-porn-molestation-charges-in-nc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>illegalaliencrimereport.com/post/illegal-alie<span class=\"invisible\">n-arrested-on-child-porn-molestation-charges-in-nc<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

You have no arguments based in reality. Speaking of bell curves... did you know the top \"nazis\" of WW2 had their IQs measured during the Nuremberg trials? Their IQs were, on average, two standard deviations higher than \"normal\" people. I believe Uncle Adolf's was around 140 as well.<br /><br />1. Hjalmar Schacht 143<br />2. Arthur Seyss-Inquart 141<br />3. Hermann Goering 138<br />4. Karl Doenitz 138<br />5. Franz von Papen 134<br />6. Eric Raeder 134<br />7. Dr. Hans Frank 130<br />8. Hans Fritsche 130<br />9. Baldur von Schirach 130<br />10. Joachim von Ribbentrop 129<br />11. Wilhelm Keitel 129<br />12. Albert Speer 128<br />13. Alfred Jodl 127<br />14. Alfred Rosenberg 127<br />15. Constantin von Neurath 125<br />16. Walther Funk 124<br />17. Wilhelm Frick 124<br />18. Rudolf Hess 120<br />19. Fritz Sauckel 118<br />20. Ernst Kaltenbrunner 113<br />21. Julius Streicher 106<br /><br />You may also find these attached tweets made by \"the smartest man in the world\" (with an IQ so high it couldn't be measured properly) to be interesting.<br /><br />The thing about high intelligence is that it helps you see the world for exactly what it is, which includes examination of all possibilities, perspectives, and timelines, and logically deducing the most accurate state along with the sequence of events leading to that state. It should also be of no surprise that smart people see through all the bullshit of \"normies\", and in the case of the last century or so, normie bullshit (leading to the degeneration and destruction of western civilization) has an easily identifiable source: the jews.<br /><br />If you truly consider yourself to be intelligent, you should reexamine everything you think you know (i.e., brainwashed to believe) about history as it leads to our current state, and realize you have been purposefully misinformed and misled. The keyword here is \"purposefully\".<br /><br />You've been around here more than long enough to be aware of all of this though, of course, so the only reason you continue to reject the reality of it all is because you are brainwashed and/or you have a (((vested interest))) in destroying Whites.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/JesseNada1984\" class=\"u-url mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@JesseNada1984<\/a>",

He cited the central bank’s mismanagement of the global financial crisis, its decision to cut interest rates three times in 2019, and the revelation this month that two of its regional presidents, Robert Kaplan and Eric Rosengren, traded stocks and other securities last year.<br /><br />The Scion Asset Management chief attached a screenshot of Kaplan’s latest financial-disclosure form, which showed the official traded millions of dollars’ worth of Tesla, Chevron, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and other stocks in 2020. Both Kaplan and Rosengren announced their resignations this week, the latter citing health issues.<br /><br />Burry – who has warned of a huge market bubble and predicted the “mother of all crashes” is coming in recent months – also rang the inflation alarm. “Inflationary mindset is not something you’d want to short,” he tweeted. “Ask Costco.”<br /><br />Costco’s finance chief, Richard Galanti, noted the rising cost of goods such as oil, coffee, and nuts during the big-box retailer’s earnings call last week. He listed a raft of inflationary pressures including higher labor, freight, and commodity prices. He also noted shortages of containers and products such as computer chips, greater transportation demand, and delays at shipping ports. “It’s a lot of fun right now,” he quipped.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/10/investor-behind-big-short-rings-inflation-alarm-warns-huge-market-bubble-mother-crashes/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2021/10/investor-behind-<span class=\"invisible\">big-short-rings-inflation-alarm-warns-huge-market-bubble-mother-crashes/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

For example, a home charging system for a Tesla requires 75 amp service. The average house is equipped with 100 amp service. On our small street (approximately 25 homes), the electrical infrastructure would be unable to carry more than three houses with a single Tesla each. For even half the homes to have electric vehicles, the system would be wildly over-loaded.This is the elephant in the room with electric vehicles. Our residential infrastructure cannot bear the load. So, as our genius elected officials promote this nonsense, not only are we being urged to buy these things and replace our reliable, cheap generating systems with expensive new windmills and solar cells, but we will also have to renovate our entire delivery system! This later \"investment\" will not be revealed until we're so far down this dead end road that it will be presented with an   'OOPS...!' and a shrug.If you want to argue with a green person over cars that are eco-friendly, just read the following. Note: If you ARE a green person, read it anyway. It's enlightening.Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, \"For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine.\" Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran  on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity.I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery. $18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery. Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 Mpg = $0.10 per mile.  The gasoline powered car costs about $25,000 while the Volt costs $46,000 plus. So the  Government wants us to pay twice as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run, and takes three times longer to drive across the country.WAKE UP NORTH AMERICA!!!!",
