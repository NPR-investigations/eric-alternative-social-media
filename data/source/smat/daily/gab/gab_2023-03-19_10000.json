They will try everything to not lose it, however the Western 🏳️‍🌈 media claimed a lot it never mattered, but those fortifications there speak more than thousand words. It will be a media catastrophe when both cities are lost, so they will spin it like they never mattered. Thanks Brian Berletic for the constant &amp; reliable updates! 👍\"Rochelle Glickman: \"Thank heavens for this news. I hope it will end the suffering of the people of Donetsk City.\" 🙏Corbynite: \"The liberation of Avdeevka will bring more relief to the people of DPR, at least in the short term, than the liberation of Bakhmut, precisely because it has been used by the 🇺🇦Banderites to shell civilian targets in Donetsk for so long. This is welcome news. Thank you for the updates Brian.\"georgekostaras: \"I remember like two weeks ago western media was saying that Bakhmut was strategically irrelevant. Now they’re saying it’s life and death. I’m sure after it falls they’ll go back to saying it never mattered.\"              Eric Kemper: \"Thank you for all the updates on the liberation of Ukraine/ #WestRussia!\"Terry Stevenson: \"An outstanding update! Thank you, Brian. #Russia is not just holding out against NATO, Russia is winning. Russia has also defeated #NATO's economic strangulation, and time is up now for [their] imperial banking system &amp; [their] crappy, financialized economies. But you're right, the western oligarchs are nuts &amp; they are out of options, that means [they] are dangerous for the world.\"Bobby Fresh: \"Always happy to watch your presentation!\"Robert Olweny: \"Thank you, Brian!!!

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

They will try everything to not lose it, however the Western 🏳️‍🌈 media claimed a lot it never mattered, but those fortifications there speak more than thousand words. It will be a media catastrophe when both cities are lost, so they will spin it like they never mattered. Thanks Brian Berletic for the constant &amp; reliable updates! 👍\"<br /><br />Rochelle Glickman: \"Thank heavens for this news. I hope it will end the suffering of the people of Donetsk City.\" 🙏<br /><br />Corbynite: \"The liberation of Avdeevka will bring more relief to the people of DPR, at least in the short term, than the liberation of Bakhmut, precisely because it has been used by the 🇺🇦Banderites to shell civilian targets in Donetsk for so long. This is welcome news. Thank you for the updates Brian.\"<br /><br />georgekostaras: \"I remember like two weeks ago western media was saying that Bakhmut was strategically irrelevant. Now they’re saying it’s life and death. I’m sure after it falls they’ll go back to saying it never mattered.\"<br /><br />Eric Kemper: \"Thank you for all the updates on the liberation of Ukraine/ <a href=\"/tags/WestRussia\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#WestRussia<\/a>!\"<br /><br />Terry Stevenson: \"An outstanding update!

But you're right, the western oligarchs are nuts &amp; they are out of options, that means [they] are dangerous for the world.\"<br /><br />Bobby Fresh: \"Always happy to watch your presentation!\"<br />Robert Olweny: \"Thank you, Brian!!!
