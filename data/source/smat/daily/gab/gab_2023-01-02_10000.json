By Eric MosherAs I sit here, yet another Christmas going by where I can’t be with the ones I love, it never gets any easier.I think of laughter with my friends and family, opening presents with my daughters, eating Christmas cookies (way too many….), hugs and stories, all the holiday “feel goods.” I sure do miss it, that’s the truth. What helps me get by is the true meaning of Christmas. Our Almighty God, sending His one and only son as the ultimate gift. Jesus, in the flesh, born for us to die for us! Is there a greater gift? I sure can’t think of one. And all we have to do is believe and receive. I’m so thankful that I’ve received that free gift of grace, and He’s prepared a place for me that’s so wonderful that words can’t explain it. I’m overjoyed by His giving to me, by His birth, death, and resurrection. He paid the price for the price I should be paying. Paid in full. I still have consequences to pay for my actions, but forgiveness was given. I wouldn’t be able to get through these hard times without Christ. I may be able to get through them to a certain extent, but how I get through them, to me, makes all the difference. I’m grateful this holiday season to really think of receiving the ultimate gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ, my Savior.     ... by Eric MosherEDITOR'S NOTE:  Please send your encouraging comments and notes to our ministry member and author, Eric, at the following address (He would love to hear from you!):SMART COMMUNICATIONS / PADOCEric Mosher, QA0727SCI MahanoyPO Box 33028St. Petersburg, FL 33733(Published on http://www.PrisonMentoring.com where you can find many inspiring articles written by Christian inmates!)   The Perfect Worship by Alexis RodriquezThe perfect worship is not the consciousness of my sinnor reiterating my imperfections over and over again.Nor is it to fall in love in rapturous devotion misunderstood,but rather to do Your will daily, effectively, humbly.What are my eyes for if they cannot see You, All-seeing?For real I am lame 'cause having feet and ability, I go nowhere and do nothing but run away!

In my current circumstance of being incarcerated, believe me it's hard to acknowledge this, because I look for encouragement from the outside.

Good.  Maybe sanity will prevail in the end.  Here’s what no-cash bail laws do:  A New York man was arrested for beating his wife.  He was released on no bail.  Less than 24 hours later, he shot her dead in front of her three children.  The no-bail situation in New York City has gotten so bad, Mayor Eric Adams now calls it ‘catch and release’ and said, “We have to stop passing laws that protect the guilty.”Eric Adams might finally be telling the truth, but other Democrats who brought you insane ideas like no-bail are now trying to cover up the consequences of their insanity.  In Chicago, the mayor - who condones riots - wants to switch from police scanners to encrypted radio frequencies.  This will prevent journalists from reporting breaking crime stories and the public from learning about threats to their safety.  In Colorado, a Democrat senator’s wife is urging lawmakers to defund the police the sneaky way by reallocating funds to social services.  In case you don’t know, several cities got mugged by the reality of what happens when you defund the police and moved to re-fund their police departments.  But not in Seattle, which has found another sneaky way to defund the police.  The tolerance for riots and disparagement of police professionals caused a number of vacant positions in the police department and the city council voted last month to eliminate 80 of them.  But try as they might, the stupid Democrats can’t cover up the fact that large cities like Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles are now more dangerous than war zones like Iraq or Afghanistan for young males.  The most dangerous city is actually St. Louis where the progressive prosecutor won’t accept arrests by 300 officers and the mayor won’t authorize pay increases for officers, causing the police department to operate at less than half strength.  Staffing shortages and progressive prosecutors are being blamed for the rise in violent crime in many cities across the country last year.And Democrats can’t cover up the fact that Target lost $400 million last year to organized retail theft.  Overall, retail theft is up more than 26 percent and is closing in on $100 billion a year.  Houston - and elsewhere - we got a problem.  Walmart is warning it will have to raise prices and close stores, if this keeps up.  The CEO specifically blamed progressive prosecutors and their soft-on-crime policies.  The violence is so bad in North Philly, a gas station owner hired armed security.  Police don’t respond and nobody feels safe, he said.  A restaurant in D.C. is closing down because employees are being attacked and their cars are being broken into.  The insane Democrats who run the city voted late last year to reduce penalties for illegal gun possession, carjacking, robbery, and other crimes. Another business closed, this one in Portland, another Democrat city that loves riots.  The owner cited “unrelenting criminal behavior” and “escalating safety issues” for employees. “We have no protection, or recourse, against the criminal behavior that goes unpunished,” an open letter posted on the front door said.  Here’s the interesting part:  You hear these progressive prosecutors and other apologists for high crime say, ‘don’t worry about it, insurance will cover any losses.’  Not true.  The owner went on to write: “Do not be fooled into thinking that insurance companies cover losses. We have sustained 15 break-ins … we have not received any financial reimbursement since the 3rd.”Think about all this the next time the Democrats are flashing you a big smile and asking you to keep them in power.  Better yet, take action now.  The city council in Roanoke recently asked state lawmakers to undo the Democrats’ woke criminal justice reforms and bring back no-knock warrants, traffic stops for broken tail lights and other minor infractions, and holding suspects without bond for violent offenses.  Voters in Democrat-controlled Kansas City, Missouri voted up a constitutional amendment requiring the city to spend more on police.  This is not a situation where reforms swing between competing values on a pendulum.  The Democrats threw the pendulum out the window with their woke criminal justice reforms.  But this is still America and citizens like you can take action so they can’t turn your life into a war zone.",

Further, he does indeed say in his sworn testimony that he “also orchestrated it.”<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen, @AdamKinzinger, member of the “bipartisan” Jan. 6 Committee, literally spreading lies about Jan. 6. <a href=\"https://t.co/sXn3rxnDEQ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>t.co/sXn3rxnDEQ<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"http://pic.twitter.com/wUb0tpO1ye\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>pic.twitter.com/wUb0tpO1ye<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />— Viva Frei (@thevivafrei) January 1, 2023<br /><br />@AdamKinzinger <a href=\"https://t.co/Ons2tP4eOK\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>t.co/Ons2tP4eOK<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"http://pic.twitter.com/RX6hXqeh3d\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>pic.twitter.com/RX6hXqeh3d<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />— Mike Engleman🇺🇲 (@RealHickory) January 1, 2023<br /><br />Why is a congressman who served on the January 6 committee outright lying about something that is so obviously true? The videos of Epps are not new and have been circulating since 2021. He clearly and unambiguously incited the riot and the entry into the Capitol Building. In fact, when you watch the different clips of him, he seems to be very well rehearsed in what he’s saying and doing.<br /><br />That he was never arrested while grandmas who took selfies were thrown into solitary confinement has always been a major red flag. Given that, perhaps we should figure out why Kinzinger keeps defending the one man with the most evidence of incitement against him in relation to January 6th. Wasn’t the committee’s entire justification for existing to find out why the attack happened? Yet, they completely ignore the man who instigated it?<br /><br />None of that makes any sense unless you begin to think the worst, which is that the government was involved. But hey, I’m sitting here typing this, willing to hear a reasonable explanation for why Epps was ignored by the committee and has never been arrested. If Kinzinger has one, he’s welcome to share it because lying about what happened isn’t convincing anyone.<br /><br />Rep.

So while Trump Hating CNN &amp; MSNBC RATINGS are both at record lows, numbers that they have never seen before, Fox News Ratings are also way down because they never say “Trump” or TRUTH, never talk about the Rigged Presidential Election, and is a Fake Polling Network. Our giant MAGA base, much bigger than anyone knows, does not like watching Fox play their games. Their Ratings will continue to sink. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Donald J. TrumpOnce again, President Trump is right! People have caught on to all the lies and are now spotting the liars and questioning all things. Even die hard democrats are now questioning the mob rule mentality of democracy. Many never understood that Pelosi’s democracy was a rigged and frauded election where the puppet masters appointed a bunch of seats in the congress and senate. It was never a fair election, nor was it ever a representation of We The People. This is the same election appointment fraud schemes that also take place on the state and local levels.If we heard “SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY” once, we heard it as many times as we heard “hello” when we answer our phones. All the deep state needs are a majority of puppet heads in government seats and their mob rule is pushed to whatever they want as they shout they are the majority and the majority rules.Even constituents in democratic cities were not all on board for their form of Marxist Nazi governing, that left them jobless, homeless, penniless, and inflation so high they can barely afford the basics of energy, food, water and gasoline. Many liberals and democrats were never believing there was such a thing as a new world order where all things were rationed and only those selected would be granted freedoms and rights. Now they are seeing a big communist push. One they were totally blind to seeing. And many are crying out for law and order as they cannot go anywhere without worrying about getting robbed, hit, or killed by lawless, desperate crazy people. Many have been crippled and died from the jabs and now many who believed the lies and pushed it as something that everyone must do have jab remorse.This is all part of their global RESET Agenda WHOSE GREATEST WEAPON IS FEAR!We are at war and in this war and we are all being subjected to the same PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE – it is up to us to know what is truth and what is a fake narrative!In 2014 OBAMA MADE IT LEGAL TO USE PSYCOLOGICAL WARFARE ON AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU ARE BEING LIED TO AT EVERY TURN TO CREATE FEAR SO YOU WILL DO AS THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWLESS GOVERNMENT TELLS YOU TO DO. DO NOT FEAR! This is one big, fat, drama show to have you self destruct from fear.That is not to say bad and horrific things aren’t happening. They are happening. It is to say that a lot of what they are saying is NOT HAPPENING AND WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF YOU DO AS THEY TELL YOU TO DO.When it gets so bad that you have no privacy in your own home for everything has a tracking device in it from your cell phone to your appliances, that’s bad enough and quite an eye opener. But, when the school system has become a cross between a live science lab and an eugenics experimental playground where they spend more time on sex education, and showing children how to be a furry, and confuse a girl she is really a boy and a boy he is really a girl and encourage transgendering without parents permission…then it is no longer safe to even send your child to a public school. But fear not. Instead, home school or find a private school until the scourge passes over.Prepare our youth with truth… they need your support!Read morehttps://diannemarshallreport.com/2023-psychological-warfare-year-3/",
