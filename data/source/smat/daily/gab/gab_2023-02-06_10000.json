            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

            "description": "\"Here I stand.\"Martin Luther's immortal words. And here we stand - fleeing to Christ as our only hope for salvation.\"I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.\" (Psalm 73)Here we stand, on the \"Five Solas\" of the great reformation in Christian theology - the \"Reformation.\"1. Sola Scriptura - The authoritative rule for religious knowledge, faith and practice is the Bible alone (and not the traditions of any church or other religious organization).2. Sola Gratia - We - all we descendents of Adam - are sinners by nature. In ourselves, we are dead and dying - and utterly helpless and hopeless to save ourselves. We are completely dependent on God's grace alone to save us.3. Sola Fide - By His great mercy, God is pleased to save those who have faith in the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ. The instrument of our salvation is faith alone (and not our efforts or work).4. Solus Christus - It is the work of Christ alone - His perfect life of completely fulfilling the Law of God, His atoning sacrifice of death on the Cross to pay for our sins, and His resurrection from the dead to conquer death - that is the only merit and basis for our salvation.5. Soli Deo Gloria - Our salvation is completely by and from God, and God alone receives the glory for our salvation.\"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it - the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction. for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.

Eric M. Smith on Friday ordered the detention of two White Hat officers after learning they had failed two consecutive polygraphs aimed at figuring out whether they were Constitutionalists or secretly loyal to the criminal Biden regime, sources in the general’s office told Real Raw News.As reported in December, Gen. Smith said he would add polygraphs to his arsenal of tools to expose traitors. He enacted that pledge two weeks ago, having recruited leading NCIS polygraphers to test what could amount to over 1,000 armed forces members.

Eric M. Smith on Friday ordered the detention of two White Hat officers after learning they had failed two consecutive polygraphs aimed at figuring out whether they were Constitutionalists or secretly loyal to the criminal Biden regime, sources in the general’s office told Real Raw News.<br /><br />As reported in December, Gen. Smith said he would add polygraphs to his arsenal of tools to expose traitors. He enacted that pledge two weeks ago, having recruited leading NCIS polygraphers to test what could amount to over 1,000 armed forces members. According to our source, the general is randomly and dispassionately deciding which officers get polygraphed first, since he has no clear proof that any one of them is a traitor.......<br /><br />“A tardy vengeance shares the tyrant's guilt.”<br />........ 👺 LOGIC &amp; REASON ....

If Hitler and Hirohito and Mussolini hadn't been imperialist, there wouldn't have been World War II.

And, the transfer of the boxes of documents, which began in 2010 and had dubious aspects, did not happen until 2012. Now as the strange aspect are coming to light, some are calling for transparency as to the documents, what they contain, and the specifics of the timeline during the transfer of the boxes.As Biz Pac Review reports:The story begins in 2010, when a business associate of Biden’s crack-smoking son, Hunter, was inexplicably assigned the task of transferring the documents from Biden’s VP office to the University of Delaware. The moving of the documents was reportedly performed by Eric Schwerin, who was Hunter’s Rosemont Seneca business partner. The 1,850 boxes of documents were moved to the University of Delaware after Biden decided to donate them. While most of the documents were reportedly from his tenure as a Delaware senator, some of the documents were also from the 2009 Obama-Biden presidential transition, as exclusively reported on Thursday by the Daily Mail.Prior to the documents being moved, the then-VP’s deputy counsel, Katherine Oyama, reportedly wrote an email to Schwerin warning him that the documents contained 2009 Obama-Biden presidential transition papers that “the vice president likely does not own.” “She recommended the inclusion of language about ‘the University’s duty to comply with … classified information procedures,’” according to the Daily Mail. Schwerin subsequently forwarded Oyama’s email to Hunter and wrote, “FYI – if you want to be in the loop. I sent to Mel who is going to talk to your Dad about this and decide who should work on it between him and Jamie.” Mel was reportedly a reference to attorney Melvyn Monzack, who “handled Hunter and Joe’s brother Jim’s taxes and other Biden family affairs,” according to the Daily Mail.But the documents didn’t arrive at the University of Delaware until June 6th, 2012.“The University of Delaware’s Morris Library last week welcomed a delivery of 1,875 boxes full of Vice President Joe Biden’s senatorial papers, the largest collection that the library’s special collections department has ever received,” the Newark Post reported at the time. “Crews moved the 33 pallets of boxes from two trucks into the library’s basement, where the papers were secured on mechanical compact shelving, built especially to accommodate the large collection,” the Post added.The library posted about the receipt of the documents:Site #22: Morris Library, Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE.Since 2012, this library has been the repository of the much-discussed Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Senatorial Papers. The archive will be publicly accessible 2 years after Biden retires from public life.https://t.co/lBHdYcbNEw http://pic.twitter.com/nOjTTqr2vK— Andy Bass (@AndyBassNY) February 17, 2021Biz Pac Review noted:The documents are also related to the Tara Reade scandal. Recall that during the 2020 presidential race, Tara Reade came forth accusing Biden of having sexually harassed her decades ago as a Delaware senator. The following year, Judicial Watch and the Daily Caller News Foundation sued the University of Delaware demanding access to the documents so they could comb through them for any proof confirming Reade’s accusation. “The records sought by both the DCNF and Judicial Watch may contain information related to Tara Reade — who in 1993, while working in Biden’s senate office, accused him of sexually assaulting her. A copy of the complaint she filed on the matter and related documents to the alleged incident may also be included in the records,” the Daily Caller reported at the time.The contents of the boxes remains a mystery. “Fox News Digital reached out to the University of Delaware on Wednesday asking if the papers Biden donated to the school from his Senate career have been combed for classified documents. The university did not respond to a media inquiry,” Fox News reported Thursday. Former White House ethics chief Richard Painter stated, “Somebody should be taking a look to make sure there aren’t classified documents sitting over there at the University of Delaware,” he told Fox News.",
