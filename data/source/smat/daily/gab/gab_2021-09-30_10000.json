The Dominion executive came across completely unhinged and angry.<br />That’s when far left Judge Marie Avery Moses stepped in to protect Eric Coomer.<br />udge Moses issued a Protective Order that only grants secrecy to Eric Coomer’s deposition – but not anyone else’s.<br />According to our confidential source, “The Judge issued this order sua sponte, which means that no one asked her to do this. She just did it on her own the day after Coomer gave a train-wreck deposition in which he was very clearly emotionally unstable, arrogant, and repeatedly failed to give direct answers to questions. He was clearly playing games and his testimony is simply not credible.”<br />The media is now blocked from downloading his testimony.<br />One wonders how the Judge came to this conclusion – the day after Coomer’s deposition – that his deposition transcript needed to be sealed.<br />What happened to integrity, honesty and justice in America?<br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/09/far-left-judge-marie-avery-moses-issues-protective-order-eric-coomers-deposition-comes-across-completely-unhinged-not-defendants-including-gateway-pundit/?utm_source=Gab&amp;utm_campaign=websitesharingbuttons\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2021/09/far-left-judge-m<span class=\"invisible\">arie-avery-moses-issues-protective-order-eric-coomers-deposition-comes-across-completely-unhinged-not-defendants-including-gateway-pundit/?utm_source=Gab&amp;utm_campaign=websitesharingbuttons<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

What's not surprising is that he stole something and that he was completely unaware of his surroundings.  On a positive note, the CCP thanks him for his service\", said Fang.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4979650/user-clip-swalwell-2nd-base\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>c-span.org/video/?c4979650/user-clip-swalwell<span class=\"invisible\">-2nd-base<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Islamic tradition divides the Qur’an into chapters from Mecca and chapters from Medina. The Meccan suras are supposed to be more tolerant and peaceful (satanic verses) than the Medinan ones. Yet this chappie specifically invoked “the Qur’an of Mecca” as he was threatening to kill Zemmour. Does he know something that our Western non-Muslim imams such as Pope Francis and Joe Biden don’t?<br />He was recognized by a man who started to insult him, yelling at him “by the Koran of Mecca, I will smoke you out.” The police officer of the SDLP [protection service, editor’s note] then intervened, but the individual “got excited,” shouting in particular “f**king racist s**t,” we are told.<br /><br />Eric Zemmour and the police officer then headed for the journalist’s vehicle in order to get to safety. Once the two men were inside the car, they started the car and the individual “banged on the hood of the car.”<br /><br />On Twitter, Eric Zemmour deplored this aggression, “the daily life of so many French people,” according to him.",

I did the math modeling that just makes this FACT, not a thing to debate on the internet about. I may have to write Eric Dollard by hand and tell him the next stage of evolution in this technology. How do you approach such a genius and tell him ONLY what he is doing less than perfect? Like this. <br /><br /><br />DSM 5D<br />0 seconds ago<br />Nice, now I see Eric's larger scale vision. We ALL know in this community that patent law is the thing God has returned to kill. I was shown the Earth Engine, retrodicted it internally and now find it compelling for home use but NEED diagrams to see if it can be improved. It is actually the simplest ether churning device possible, HOW did it take this long for someone to make an asymmetrical dynamic Halbach array dipole? A differential gear with magnetic field geometries as both grease and gear mesh; the teeth never wear out, but the permanent mags do lose strength over time and are supposedly recharged when a unit is taken offline. The only thing that is curious is how the self-correcting field geometries are achieved, I think a spring-field strength dynamic balancer is all that is needed. <br /><br />I heard that Tesla experimented with a triple coil design, and that is a thing I would like to exchange with Eric about. If the time component in the whole device can be fractally reduced to three constituent components, then exponential and not multiplicative scaling can be done. The directionality of the circuit determines an incursion into or extraction from counterspace, the timing of the three components can be embedded into a 1^3 instead of 1X2 arch form model. Left hand and right hand rules. This is the e(c), sq2 and Pi engineering algebra nobody will want to understand. Building 3rd power series objects and extracting RATIONAL functions from them that compute over time, describing the path and value of the three Steinmetz coefficients over space and time. Leave it in the movies. I still eat out of the garbage, I don't want to bother Eric because it was a phase for him. Nice to be past it I suppose. But now I own mathematics.",

The average house is equipped with 100 amp service. On our small street (approximately 25 homes), the electrical infrastructure would be unable to carry more than three houses with a single Tesla each. For even half the homes to have electric vehicles, the system would be wildly over-loaded.<br />This is the elephant in the room with electric vehicles. Our residential infrastructure cannot bear the load.\"<br />So, as our genius elected officials promote this nonsense, not only are we being urged to buy these things and replace our reliable, cheap generating systems with expensive new windmills and solar cells, but we will also have to renovate our entire delivery system! This later \"investment\" will not be revealed until we're so far down this dead end road that it will be presented with an   'OOPS...!' and a shrug.<br />Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, \"For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine.\" Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran  on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.<br />It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.<br />According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity.<br />I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery. $18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery. Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 Mpg = $0.10 per mile.  <br />The gasoline powered car costs about $25,000 while the Volt costs $46,000 plus. So the  Government wants us to pay twice as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run, and takes three times longer to drive across the country.<br />WAKE UP NORTH AMERICA",

Não é uma ideologia ou filosofia humana, pois são homens em busca de Deus, não o contrário. A verdadeira religião corresponde à realidade, à verdade, fugindo do instinto revolucionário que transforma — ou deforma —  as relações de trabalho, a família e o sagrado. <br /><br />O cristianismo não estabelece um projeto de sociedade ou subversão de classes, mas preserva aquilo que a ideologia rejeita: a ordem. Sendo assim, o caráter primordial da ideologia é observado na idolatria do coletivismo ou individualismo sem qualquer noção de transcendência. <br /><br />O cristianismo trata de dimensões extraordinárias e experiências que fogem da compreensão humana. Sem fé, obviamente o coração e a alma são um terreno fértil para abraçar qualquer absurdo. <br /><br />Com efeito, para a ideologia ter uma força real, precisa mesmo se parecer com a religião. Algo perfeitamente verossímil para as religiões políticas, que necessitam copiar os esquemas estruturais — particularmente dos monoteísmos — esvaziando-os de seu conteúdo metafísico.<br /><br />“A ideologia é a existência em rebelião contra Deus e o homem.\" — Eric Voegelin<br /><br />Ideologias não salvam. <br /><br />Participe do desafio Contra as Ideologias e entre no canal exclusivo do Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/contraasideologias\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>t.me/contraasideologias<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the committee, said “the inquiry includes examination of how various individuals and entities coordinated their activities leading up to the events of January 6.”The letters from Thompson cite efforts by representatives of the group Women for America First to organize the rally on Jan. 6 and to collectively communicate with senior White House officials. The subpoenas also mention other events the group planned in the weeks between Trump’s November election defeat and the January attack.Among those from whom the committee is seeking information is Caroline Wren, a veteran GOP fundraiser who was named as a “VIP Advisor” on an attachment to the permit that Women for America First submitted. During the campaign, she was a national finance consultant for Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee between the president’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.The AP has previously reported that Wren was involved in at least one call before the pro-Trump rally with members of several groups listed as rally participants to organize credentials for VIP attendees.",

Although “fewer than 50 people have died from COVID-19,” and imposing mass segregation clearly violates the rights to freedom and equality, both church and civil authorities thought it would be a prudent move to coerce people into taking the jab and presumably slow the spread of the virus.In other news, Pope Francis took issue with an unnamed Catholic television network (reportedly EWTN), calling it “the work of the devil.” Evidently, the station produced programming critical of the pope and even received official complaints from the Vatican.That said, the station has also been a powerful tool for evangelization and a great resource for Catholics to learn more about the faith. One wonders how the pope is comfortable condemning a Catholic TV network in the harshest terms while complimenting a brutal and murderous regime like the Chinese Communist Party.So what do these two news items have in common besides having to do with the Catholic Church? They are both a result of the same phenomenon that has plagued the church and nearly every other political and cultural institution in the developed world: deadly indifference.I take this term from the new book from Catholic writer and editor Eric Sammons who explains how the church went from being a large, influential community of practicing Christians to a hollowed-out cultural relic run by out-of-touch Boomers. In short, he argues that church leaders in the 1960s took radical measures to “open up” to different viewpoints and practices. In effect, they became “indifferent” to frequently incompatible systems of thought.As Sammons points out, Catholic teaching itself stayed the same, but the emphasis of that teaching changed in important ways. No longer would Catholics proclaim their faith to the world; they would now foster two-way dialogues with everyone.No longer would they set themselves apart from other faiths and things of the world; they would now seek common ground in the interest of world peace and mutual understanding. No longer would they insist on being disciples of Christ to attain salvation; they would insist on following one’s conscience and trust in a loving (and remarkably indulgent) God.",

Although “fewer than 50 people have died from COVID-19,” and imposing mass segregation clearly violates the rights to freedom and equality, both church and civil authorities thought it would be a prudent move to coerce people into taking the jab and presumably slow the spread of the virus.\n\nIn other news, Pope Francis took issue with an unnamed Catholic television network (reportedly EWTN), calling it “the work of the devil.” Evidently, the station produced programming critical of the pope and even received official complaints from the Vatican.\n\nThat said, the station has also been a powerful tool for evangelization and a great resource for Catholics to learn more about the faith. One wonders how the pope is comfortable condemning a Catholic TV network in the harshest terms while complimenting a brutal and murderous regime like the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSo what do these two news items have in common besides having to do with the Catholic Church? They are both a result of the same phenomenon that has plagued the church and nearly every other political and cultural institution in the developed world: deadly indifference.\n\nI take this term from the new book from Catholic writer and editor Eric Sammons who explains how the church went from being a large, influential community of practicing Christians to a hollowed-out cultural relic run by out-of-touch Boomers. In short, he argues that church leaders in the 1960s took radical measures to “open up” to different viewpoints and practices. In effect, they became “indifferent” to frequently incompatible systems of thought.\n\nAs Sammons points out, Catholic teaching itself stayed the same, but the emphasis of that teaching changed in important ways. No longer would Catholics proclaim their faith to the world; they would now foster two-way dialogues with everyone.\n\nNo longer would they set themselves apart from other faiths and things of the world; they would now seek common ground in the interest of world peace and mutual understanding. No longer would they insist on being disciples of Christ to attain salvation; they would insist on following one’s conscience and trust in a loving (and remarkably indulgent) God.",

Touching a child inappropriately is a CRIME - <br />no matter what lengths that government officials, such as California Democrats Nancy Pedolosi or her nephew Gavin Newsome as Governor of California and their vote-rigged \"leadership\" pass unconstitutional laws in California that Pedophiles do not have to register as Sex offenders.<br /><br />PEDOPHILES are deranged human beings targeting children for Sex.<br /><br />Usurper Obama - during the Obama-Biden Administration - devised a HATE CRIMES BILL to provide federal protections for Pedophiles (who commit crimes against children), people who practice bestiality and Muslims - being assaulted as HATE CRIMES.<br /><br />Usurper Obama and US AG Eric Holder then devised a Plan to have CHRISTIANS and their businesses = bakeries owned and operated by Christians to be harassed and assaulted for refusing to bake same-sex marriage wedding cakes. <br /><br />Obama's US AG Holder then filed Civil Rights complaints against the Christian bakers and their business for denying the request of gay people - <br />earning big settlements as payment for participating in Obama's EXTORTION schemes and Obama's HATE CRIMES against Americans.<br /><br />But yet when a Jewish person went to a bakery owned by Muslims, requested services for bakery items for his Jewish faith, was refused, he reported it to the DOJ.<br /><br />The man of Jewish faith received a phone call from US AG Holder himself, warning the man if he returned to the Muslim-owned and operated bakery to harass them for what he requested, he would get harassment charges and a civil rights complaint filed against him!<br /><br />By 2013, during the obama-biden Administration - w HRC as Sec of US State Dept, <br />The USA became known as The PEDOPHILE and CHILD TRAFFICKING Capitol of the world.",

The entire so-called congress and Supreme Court is compromised and needs to be arrested for installing the illegitimate Enemy Cabal posers. Rand Paul signed the NDAA National Defense Authorization Act - to detain American Citizens with out Due Process.  Rand Paul talks a lot of red meat though lol 🤣 There is no doj, fbi, dhs or other so-called Law Enforcement. DHS and ICE are moving illegal aliens around the country with Americans paying for it. There is no Dem / republican paradigm anymore, it is gone now, especially since the entire republican party is guilty of obvious RICO coordinated activity in support of obvious usurpation of the presidency and America, with Head Traitor Mike Pence certifying the Illegitimate Enemy Cabal posers. Not one Traitorous snake quisling So-called representative has called out obvious Treason and Sedition, and the obvious Big-time Crimes against Humanity Targeting Children FFS! No arrests for the illegitimate foreign actor poser homosexual AKA obama, who usurped the presidency as Not eligible because he is not a Natural Born Citizen NBC, need Two Citizen Parents according to the Constitution so there are no Divided Loyalties!! The entire rat bastard so-called congress and Supreme Court installed the Illegitimate foreign phony actor homosexual AKA obama Twice before ---- And now the wingman for the first Two usurpations of the presidency and America - Biden is installed. Americans are Red Pilled now and know that We must put down new safeguards for Liberty and Our God given Rights!! Start American Representation with out parties, you can throw a dart at a phone book and get better American Representation right now! Go after Unions for obvious Treason and Sedition - Disband all Unions too!   Still no arrests for Hillary, Soros, Leon Pennetta, Susan Rice, Eric Holder, Valerie Jarrett and so many others too. President Trump appointed Three Traitors to the so-called Supreme Court and the illegitimate foreign actor homosexual AKA obama, appointed Two Traitors illegitimately to the supreme court - that's Five Traitors appointed, then there is Traitor Roberts and Mr befuddled Thomas who doesn't recognize Threats against the Constitution, the American people, Freedom and Freedom Loving people everywhere. That's Seven Traitors for the so-called Supreme Court,while the other Two justices (spit) consent to Evil with their silence.",

At the end of the manufacturing process, electric cars are the ones generating more carbon emissions, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Can supercomputers be programmed to win elections worldwide? I think so!!<br /><br />Look at the heads of these corporations and attorneys like Marc Elias, Eric Holder and Keith Ellison on their payroll. None of these people are doing great things for all of humanity and/or Mother earth.<br /><br />Let's face it - the same types of people crying \"Environment, Climate and Global Warming have been ruling and pillaging the earth and concocting chemicals and gasses to kill, maim and sterlize.<br /><br />Manchin Says Democrats’ $3.5 Trillion Budget Bill Remains ‘Fiscal Insanity’ on Eve of Vote <a href=\"https://link.theepochtimes.com/mkt_app/manchin-says-democrats-3-5-trillion-budget-bill-remains-fiscal-insanity-on-eve-of-vote_4024643.html?utm_source=appan2028170\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>link.theepochtimes.com/mkt_app/manchin-says-d<span class=\"invisible\">emocrats-3-5-trillion-budget-bill-remains-fiscal-insanity-on-eve-of-vote_4024643.html?utm_source=appan2028170<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

          "content": "1 of 2 -<br />Stuff can point towards The Lord all day long but if it happens to be a human doing the pointing while stating he or she is the only way to properly hear from The <br />Lord, it’s not The Lord, it’s a cult. That translates to, “Run...fast.”<br /><br />There are dozens of cults. A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus” but that’s beside the point) but it fails to follow Him and <br />Him ALONE. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mary Baker Eddy of <br />Christian Science, Eric von Anderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles (S8W), Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, the Virgin Mary of Roman Catholicism, Moses of the <br />Hebrew Roots Movement, and so on. “Salvation by works” never works. No one is saved BY good works but rather UNTO them.<br /><br />A trivia note regarding SDA: Anyone remember Waco, Texas? David Koresh? The media would always refer to “The Branch Davidians”. That’s actually the abbreviated name <br />in reality. The full name is “The Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists”.<br /><br />Matthew 7:21-23 (GW)<br />“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord!’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the person who does what my Father in heaven wants. Many will say to me on that <br />day, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name? Didn’t we force out demons and do many miracles by the power and authority of your name?’ Then I will tell them <br />publicly, ‘I’ve never known you. Get away from me, you evil people.’(”)<br />Mark 1:15 (GW)<br />He said, “The time has come, and God’s kingdom is near. Change the way you think and act, and believe the Good News.”<br />John 14:6 (GW)<br />Jesus answered him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes to the Father except through me.(”)<br />John 19:30 (GW)<br />After Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, “It is finished!” Then he bowed his head and died.<br />Romans 5:10 (GW)<br />If the death of his Son restored our relationship with God while we were still his enemies, we are even more certain that, because of this restored relationship, the <br />life of his Son will save us.<br />Galatians 2:20 (GW)<br />I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live I live by believing in God’s Son, who loved me and took the punishment for my sins.<br />Colossians 2:13-14 (GW)<br />You were once dead because of your failures and your uncircumcised corrupt nature. But God made you alive with Christ when he forgave all our failures. He did this by <br />erasing the charges that were brought against us by the written laws God had established. He took the charges away by nailing them to the cross.<br />Hebrews 10:14 (GW)<br />With one sacrifice he accomplished the work of setting them apart for God forever.<br />2 Timothy 3:5 (GW)<br />They will appear to have a godly life, but they will not let its power change them. Stay away from such people.",

It didn't phase Andrew May a bit, he ran but lost his seat in 1946. Today many Rino's seems to have jumped on the Treason Gravy Train too, but Conservative have been Term Limiting them at each Election when their vote isn't needed &amp; now primarying them at every turn because this is all out War now.<br />Up to June 1943 our Submariners pretty much had the run of the Pacific, our subs could dive deeper then the Japs could so their depth charges were ineffective because to destroy a Sub they have to go off below the Sub to poke a hole in the weakest part the hull.<br />This will really piss you off. The Chairman of the Military' Intelligence Committee Andrew May (D-Ky) went on your Grandpappy's dime to Hawaii to get a 'Fact Finding' tan. With the knowledge that Hawaii still probably had an extensive spy operation there, he told the press, \"The Japs can't sink our subs, they set their depth charges at too shallow a depth.\" Within the week we were losing Subs at an alarming rate &amp; the Secretary of the Navy said May's leaking Classified Info to the enemy through Our Press cost us 10 Submarines &amp; 800 Crew Members, a low estimate in the CYA &amp; Blackmail Capitol of the world...<br />But May's crimes against America's Military didn't end there, he was also involved with steering government contracts to produce Arms to N.Y.C. Businessmen Murry &amp; Henry Garsson, who had no experience in Arms Production, giving Draft deferments to Garsson's family members &amp; friends. It was soo bad &amp; numerous May was known for having 'Blitz Calls' to give favor to Fellow Travelers. <br />The Garsson's manufactured 4.5 inch mortar shells with defective fuses causing the deaths of at least 38 Soldiers. After two hours the Jury Convicted him of taking Bribes when the Charge was a clear case of Espionage &amp; Subversion in 1947. He served 9 months at the Federal Country Club where he still remained a very powerful Democrats, the ABA Didn't revoke his Law License, that should have been done after conviction &amp; Harry Truman gave the Communist Bastard a Full Pardon on his way out the White House door in 1952.. <br />So May returned to Kentucky to fleece any poor unsuspecting soul that walked into his law office till he died in 1959 &amp; the Governor Bert T. Combs (D) named a lodge at Jenny Wiley State Park in his honor..<br />If only McCarthy had been successful, we could have gotten back too a two party system, Republicans &amp; Conservatives..",
