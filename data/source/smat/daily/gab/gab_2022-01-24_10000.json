Soros Founded and Funded ERIC Is Now Used In 31 States<br /><br />Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia participate in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), which aims to \"improve the accuracy of America's voter rolls\", but in reality, it operates as more of a voter registration drive to generate a proprietary comprehensive database of everyone who could generate a legal ballot.<br /><br />Founded in 2012 by David Becker, an experienced Democrat election lawyer, each member state submits at a minimum its voter registration and motor vehicle licensee data.<br /><br />The data includes names, addresses, phone number, date-of-birth, last four digits of social security numbers, etc.<br /><br />Becker, who remains a board member of ERIC, went on to create the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) in 2016, which distributed $69.5 million in grants from Zuckerberg for the 2020 election.<br /><br />ERIC located 17 million new voters for the 2020 election, the most in the history of the organization. <br /><br />States are required by federal law (1993 NVRA) to report to Congress how many ineligible voters they removed from their voter rolls. These are the registrations of voters who fail to respond to an address confirmation request, and fail to vote in two consecutive elections.<br /><br />A report from Judicial Watch found that large counties (not participating in ERIC) have failed to clean their voter rolls over the last four years.  <br /><br />4 YEAR REPORTED TOTALS OF INELIGIBLE VOTERS REMOVED:<br />Sacramento: 1 million, removed 0.<br />Brooklyn: 1.7 million, removed 0.<br />Queens: 1.3 million, removed zero.<br />Fresno: 500,000, removed 2.<br />Bronx: 867,000, removed 1.<br />Contra Costa: 704,000, removed 1.<br />New York: 1.26 million, removed 2.<br />Nassau: 1.1 million, removed 0.<br /><br />Dirty voter rolls matter. <br /><br />A comprehensive, proprietary voter database funded by left-wing activist gives incredible power to those who oversee the process behind closed doors.<br /><br />Part 1:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/01/cleaning-voter-rolls-soros-founded-funded-eric-now-used-31-states/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2022/01/cleaning-voter-r<span class=\"invisible\">olls-soros-founded-funded-eric-now-used-31-states/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Part 2:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/01/eric-investigation-part-2-largest-u-s-counties-removed-zero-two-ineligible-voters-voter-rolls-4-years/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2022/01/eric-investigati<span class=\"invisible\">on-part-2-largest-u-s-counties-removed-zero-two-ineligible-voters-voter-rolls-4-years/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/KanekoaTheGreat\" class=\"u-url mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@KanekoaTheGreat<\/a>",

Three detailed plans for the Extermination of the German people written by Jews.  Sterilization and Immigration are the methods described.  Food additives and vaccines almost without exception affect fertility and brainfunctions.  Sound weird ? Yes ,but why do muslims birthrate drop like a rock when they move to European countries ?  Additives by jewish controlled firms like Monsanto, and jewish Jonas Salk (polio) started the wave of vaccines. Most if not all vaccines turns out were issued after the diseases had declined on their own.  Jewish organisations like the ADL have been pushing immigration into white countries (but not into Israel)  Have the extermination plans against the Germans been modified and now turned on the entire white (Christian) culture ?  Check out Dr. David Kelly and Joseph Moshe from the links further down.  I`m just asking.  Also google the Samson Option and the Kalergi-Plan  http://www.sott.net/article/212776-Et...   http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/t...   http://www.unfictional.com/joseph-mos...   https://trutube.tv/video/30189/Crypto-Jew-Bill-Gates-Depopulation-Plans-Caught-On-Camera",

Adams said that he wanted the help of the federal government.<br /><br />For God’s sake Eric, there are over 400 million guns in America. Just how are you or anyone for that matter, going to remove guns from New York City. Thugs, cartel members, gang member and petty criminals in New York do NOT register their guns. They own their guns illegally already.<br /><br />Guns will always be available to those who are free to roam the streets of New York City to commit criminal acts against humanity. Trying to “remove guns’ to stop crime has never worked, just look at Chicago.<br /><br />The answer Eric, is to remove the criminal from the streets. When you remove the people who are willing to commit crime from the streets then crime statistics will go down.<br /><br />“Stop and Frisk” is one of the tried and proven methods of preventing criminals from committing more crime. Criminals, with prior records, are know in the communities of New York, when law enforcement is allowed to question people when they are doing things that criminals normally do, then those who are carrying illegal guns will be removed from the streets.<br /><br />Getting the federal government involved in removing guns is not going to solve anything.",

In an interview on Sunday, the mayor - who had spoken just a day earlier about a shooting that left one NYPD officer dead and two seriously wounded - declared that the federal government \"must step in.\"<br /><br />Since taking NYC's top job, Adams has been confronted with a seemingly non-stop stream of high-profile violent crimes, including a subway-pusher who killed an Asian woman, unleashing a frenzy about security on the badly underfunded MTA.<br /><br /><br />Adams wasn't the only New York Democrat to pledge a crackdown on gun trafficking and related crime. Gov. Kathy Hochul claimed in a statement this weekend that she had \"tripled\" funding to stop guns coming into the Empire State. She also said we need \"Washington teaming up with locals teaming up with us\" to get it done.",

Adams said that he wanted the help of the federal government.<br /><br />For God’s sake Eric, there are over 400 million guns in America. Just how are you or anyone for that matter, going to remove guns from New York City. Thugs, cartel members, gang member and petty criminals in New York do NOT register their guns. They own their guns illegally already.<br /><br />Guns will always be available to those who are free to roam the streets of New York City to commit criminal acts against humanity. Trying to “remove guns’ to stop crime has never worked, just look at Chicago.<br /><br />The answer Eric, is to remove the criminal from the streets. When you remove the people who are willing to commit crime from the streets then crime statistics will go down.<br /><br />“Stop and Frisk” is one of the tried and proven methods of preventing criminals from committing more crime. Criminals, with prior records, are know in the communities of New York, when law enforcement is allowed to question people when they are doing things that criminals normally do, then those who are carrying illegal guns will be removed from the streets.<br /><br />Getting the federal government involved in removing guns is not going to solve anything.",

            "description": "\"Diversity is not strength: it is weakness. The celebration of a deeply flawed figure like Martin Luther King was a confession of weakness, and the attempt to turn him into a national role model has required unsustainable myth-making. Perhaps in the future, Americans will be allowed to celebrate their own races’ heroes separately, just as Italian villages have different patron saints. Right now, however, the cost of the King cult to white America is too high.\" - Peter Brimelow\r\n\r\nRead More: https://vdare.com/articles/2022-time-to-rethink-martin-luther-king-day-now-more-than-ever\r\n\r\n❗ VDARE.com is being censored ❗\r\n\r\n🌐 Bookmark our TOR address: f2vfjp3jc37gxgn4hum4uf2bhi2w3kp4jbzdwegrn6bvtezbhminobid.onion/\r\n❔ How to use TOR: https://www.torproject.org/\r\n📣 Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/vdare\r\n🐸 And Gab: https://gab.com/vdare\r\nFollow us on Minds: https://www.minds.com/vdarefoundation\r\nand VK: https://www.vk.com/vdarefoundation\r\nJoin us on Telegram: https://t.me/vdare\r\nJoin our Slug group: https://slug.com/group/VDARE\r\nParler: @VDARE\r\n📰 Sign up for our quarterly magazine: https://vdare.com/magazine\r\nand weekly news-bulletin: https://vdare.com/ebulletins\r\n❤️️ Make a tax-deductible donation to VDARE today: https://vdare.com/donate ❤️️\r\nMake checks payable to:\r\nThe VDARE Foundation\r\nPO Box 211\r\nLitchfield, CT 06759\r\nDonate w/ Crypto\r\nBTC: 3N1azzevDjZSjorCdLaQgBCBXZzGm7ku5R\r\nETH: 0xc62767f197aa9ed9f80dc9cd5dd0a0decfb357a0\r\nLTC: LYfZs4ZgwPXdDSrZ5Mv9cJMX2ktDLGkoFr\r\nMonero: 4GdoN7NCTi8a5gZug7PrwZNKjvHFmKeV11L6pNJPgj5QNEHsN6eeX3DaAQFwZ1ufD4LYCZKArktt113W7QjWvQ7CWAbaYPasM7ZEsvvHi7",

The political motives behind this FBI effort are, yet again, brutally transparent.   The FBI are for Joe Biden what the Russian FSB is for Vladimir Putin.  That’s what they are. That’s all they are. That’s what they do.Democrat Representative Henry Cuellar represents Texas’ 28th Congressional District, which extends to the U.S.- Mexico border, and has been in Congress since 2005.  Cuellar has been very public and very critical of how Joe Biden has collapsed the U.S-Mexico border enforcement.  Suddenly, Cuellar becomes the target of the FBI.The FBI is 100% exclusively a political targeting unit of the Dept of Justice.  There was always a soft-Stasi aspect to the FBI from its inception.  However, in the modern era, especially after the passage of the Patriot Act and then the weaponization objectives of Barack Obama and Eric Holder, as they took advantage of the opportunities within the Patriot Act, the FBI was modified to be full Stasi against the American people.  Barack Obama and Eric Holder did not create a weaponized DOJ and FBI.  Instead, what they did was take the preexisting system and retool it so the weapons only targeted one side of the political continuum.  This point is where many people understandably get confused.  In the era shortly after 9/11, the DC national security apparatus was constructed to preserve continuity of government and simultaneously view all Americans as potential threats.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) were created specifically for this purpose.",

          "content": "This is the elephant in the room with electric vehicles. Our residential infrastructure cannot bear the load. So as our genius elected officials promote this nonsense, not only are we being urged to buy these things and replace our reliable, cheap generating systems with expensive, new windmills and solar cells, but we will also have to renovate our entire delivery system! This latter \"investment\" will not be revealed until we're so far down this dead end road that it will be presented with an 'OOPS..!' and a shrug.<br />If you want to argue with a green person over cars that are eco-friendly, just read the following. Note: If you ARE a green person, read it anyway. It's enlightening.<br />Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, \"For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine. Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.<br />It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.<br />According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity.<br />I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery.<br />$18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery.<br />Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 Mpg =$0.10 per mile.<br />The gasoline powered car costs about $25,000 while the Volt costs $46,000 plus. So the Canadian Government wants loyal Canadians not to do the math, but simply pay twice as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run, and takes three times longer to drive across the country.<br /> And on top of all these costs, the electricity generated to charge the car batteries is still done with fossil fuels!<br />WAKE UP AMERICA!!",

A purported email exposing the ownership interests of Rosemont Seneca Advisors was allegedly sent to Hunter by Eric Schwerin — Hunter Biden's longtime business partner.<br /><br />The report alleged that Hunter's original introduction to the Harves Group arrived in 2015 by Francis Person, who served as an adviser to then-Vice President Biden from 2009 to 2014 and was a \"special assistant\" to Biden when he was a senator. <br /><br />In July 2014, Person stopped working with then-Vice President Joe Biden. In January 2015, Person became the president of the Harves Group. By May 2018, Person became the co-founder of Harves Global Entertainment.<br /><br />Person reportedly wrote an email to Hunter in July 2015, which invited him to travel to China the following month to meet his business partner — Bo Zhang.<br /><br />\"Bo Zhang and his family would host us. They are a great family with great respect and relationships in China,\" Person allegedly wrote to Hunter in an email. \"Bo graduated from American Univ and is in his late 20’s, and his parents own Harves Century Group of Shenyang - which is a top tier private Chinese real estate development firm.\"<br /><br />P1/2",

Rail Theft: ‘We Look Like a Third-world Country’<br /><br />LOS ANGELES, California — Governor Gavin Newsom professed shock and outrage as he visited the site of mass looting of cargo trains in L.A. on Thursday, helping clean up debris and touting his recent plan to help law enforcement fight theft.<br /><br />“I’m asking myself, what the hell is going on? We look like a third-world country,” Newsom said, before apologizing for using the word “gangs” to describe the attacks on the trains, stressing that he did not mean the word in a “pejorative” way.<br /><br />As Breitbart News has reported, images and videos of torn boxes and packages were shared widely on social media last week as the country learned of the looting of cargo trains as the Union Pacific line slowed near L.A, providing a target to thieves in the absence of law enforcement.<br /><br />Newsom joined workers in trying to clean up the mess, the latest in a series of media events where he has worked to clean graffiti and debris.<br /><br />The Union Pacific rail line wrote to left-wing, George Soros-backed L.A. District Attorney George Gascón — whom Newsom endorsed — demanding better law enforcement and threatening to route trains elsewhere.<br /><br />In a statement, Newsom touted his “Real Public Safety Plan,” which proposes $255 million in grants to law enforcement agencies. It does not reverse the cuts to law enforcement undertaken by many Democrat-run cities, including L.A., where Mayor Eric Garcetti cut police funding by up to $150 million in response to the Black Lives Matter riots in the summer of 2020. Newsom also promoted his programs aimed at cleaning up the state and assisting “local litter abatement efforts.”<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2022/01/21/gavin-newsom-on-l-a-rail-theft-we-look-like-a-third-world-country/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>breitbart.com/crime/2022/01/21/gavin-newsom-o<span class=\"invisible\">n-l-a-rail-theft-we-look-like-a-third-world-country/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Kathy Hochul (D) blamed an “illegal gun” in the fatal shooting of NYPD officer Jason Rivera on Friday night.<br /><br />Rivera, 22, was shot and killed and a second officer, Wilbert More, 27, was shot and wounded, Breitbart News reported.<br /><br />The shooting suspect, Lashawn McNeil, 47, opened fire on Rivera and More as they approached him in a long hallway, CBS New York noted. McNeill was then shot twice by a third officer.<br /><br />On Saturday, Hochul tweeted, “Last night, a shot from an illegal gun took the life of a NYPD officer.” <br /><br />“When I say we’re going to do everything we can to stop the scourge of illegal guns in our state, it’s not just talk. We are tripling funding for efforts to get these guns off the streets,” Hochul added.<br /><br />New York Mayor Eric Adams (D) responded to the shooting death of Rivera by calling for more gun control, Breitbart News reported. <br /><br />New York has some of the most stringent gun controls in the country. Mike Bloomberg-affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety ranks New York No. 3 in the nation “for gun law strength.”<br /><br />Those laws include everything the Democrats are pushing at the federal level under the guise of safety, including universal background checks, a “high capacity” magazine ban, an “assault weapons” ban, a permit requirement to buy a handgun, a red flag law, gun storage requirements, “ghost gun” regulations, and a prohibition against gun possession by felons, among other controls.<br /><br />McNeil, the man who allegedly shot the NYPD officers Friday night, is a convicted felon<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/01/23/new-york-governor-blames-illegal-gun-fatal-shooting-nypd-officer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>breitbart.com/politics/2022/01/23/new-york-go<span class=\"invisible\">vernor-blames-illegal-gun-fatal-shooting-nypd-officer/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Soulless demon",
