When the raid took place, the FBI also seems to have ignored limitations imposed by the warrant, including an explicit prohibition against using the safe deposit boxes as the basis for further criminal investigations.Those details regarding the planning and execution of the FBI's raid of U.S. Private Vaults are now out in the open after a different federal judge ruled this week that the government could not keep those details out of the public record. As Reason has extensively reported, the raid on U.S. Private Vaults resulted in federal agents seizing and attempting to forfeit more than $86 million in cash as well as gold, jewelry, and other valuables from property owners who were suspected of no crimes. Attorneys representing some plaintiffs who are trying to recover their possessions interviewed the FBI agents who planned the raid, but federal prosecutors tried to keep some details of those depositions redacted.The unredacted legal documents, filed in federal court on Thursday, show why the government was eager to keep those details under wraps. (Reason submitted an amicus brief in the case arguing that the redacted documents should be made public.)",

According to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) 96 illegal migrants were transported on two buses, in effort to bring attention to the thousands of migrants crossing the southern border daily at the hands of President Joe Biden’s bad policies. &gt;&gt;“Texas is filling the gaps left in Biden’s absence at our border… We’ve made over 19,000 arrests, seized over 335.5M lethal fentanyl doses, &amp; sent over 7,400 migrants on buses to DC and over 1,500 to NYC. While Biden ignores the crisis, Texas steps up,” Abbott said in a tweet. Reports say that the illegal migrants are being housed in 14 hotels across the Big Apple because the city’s shelter system is overloaded. As part of Operation Lone Star, Abbott previously said he decided its time for the Biden administration to see the problem they created, and then walked away from. &gt;&gt;“President Biden’s continued refusal to acknowledge the crisis caused by his open border policies,” Abbott said, adding “the State of Texas has had to take unprecedented action to keep our communities safe.”The Texas governor chose New York City and Washington D.C. as a destination for the illegals because both of the Democrat-run cities have said they would welcome the migrants with open arms, that is before they thought they would have to actually deal with the crisis themselves. &gt;&gt;“They can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,” Abbott said earlier this month. He said he hopes the liberal mayors will follow through with their promises of welcoming all migrants with open arms so “that our overrun and overwhelmed border towns can find relief.”https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2022/08/28/another-busload-of-illegal-migrants-arrive-in-nyc-n2612336",

The thought that Biden plans to use hard-working taxpayer money to relieve student loan burdens is a misuse of funds and a handout to “elites,” according to several GOP members. Attorney General Eric Schmidt (R-MO) said that his office is “actively looking into legal options to halt the Biden administration’s abuse of power and assault on working-class Americans.” Some believe it isn’t fair to cancel student loan debt while so many others have had to work overtime in order to pay theirs off. &gt;&gt;“Eighty-five percent of Americans don’t have a student loan… I had a student loan. I had to pay it off,”  Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said during a rally. Meanwhile Group founder Grover Norquist told the Washington Examiner that the reason why the Biden White House didn’t go through Democrat-controlled Congress, is because the massive debt cancellation effort failed to get enough support from centrist Democrats to pass. &gt;&gt;Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, said the “plan is \"fiscally reckless, unjustified on policy grounds, likely unconstitutional, politically fraught.\"He also argued that there is no constitutional justification to cancel student loan debt, claiming that members of Congress may be able to bring a case to court against the Biden administration for bypassing Congress’s powers. Meanwhile the American Action Network released a new ad mocking Biden’s plan and liberal activists who support student loan forgiveness. &gt;&gt;“Biden's right — you should take my tax dollars to pay off your debts. My family will figure out how to get by with less. What's most important is we spare college graduates from any extra stress.\" A mechanic follows up: \"Wanna be a struggling artist?

Aufrüstung allerwärts, und wehe dem Land, das nicht imstande oder nicht gewillt ist, sich auf eigene Kraft zu verlassen. Wie glücklich sind diejenigen Völker vom Schicksal ausgestattet, deren Grenzen durch eine freundliche Natur stark, die durch hohe, unwegsame Gebirgszüge oder durch weite Meere vor feindlichen Einbrüchen ganz oder wenigstens teilweise geschützt sind. Wie unsicher anderseits ist das Leben von Völkern, deren oft an sich schon kleiner Lebensraum vorwiegend offene Grenzen ausweist, an denen Nachbarn hausen, deren unruhiger Charakter, verbunden mit überragender Bewaffnung eine ständige Bedrohung bedeutet. Während die einen über große Rohstoff- und Kolonialgebiete verfügen und infolgedessen wirtschaftlich in Krieg und Frieden weitgehend unabhängig sind, besitzen andere, nicht minder lebensfähige, an Zahl oftmals größere Völker nur eine sehr geringe Rohstoffbasis und kleine oder gar keine Kolonialgebiete; sie befinden sich daher in ständiger wirtschaftlichen Schwierigkeiten und sind nicht in der Lage, einen langen Krieg zu ertragen. Es leuchtet ein, daß die Unerträglichkeit lang dauernder kriegerischer Verwicklungen mit ihrer unvermeidlichen wirtschaftlichen Verelendung diejenigen Völker, die durch die geschichtliche Entwicklung und die Einsichtslosigkeit im Überfluß lebender anderer Nationen in eine solche Zwangslage geraten sind, zu der Überlegung zwingt, welche Mittel sich dazu eignen, einen bewaffneten Konflikt rasch zu einem erträglichen Ende zu führen. Die Hungersnot, die der Weltkrieg und die grausame Fortsetzung der Blockade nach dem Waffenstillstand für die Mittelmächte im Gefolge hatte, ist noch in zu frischer Erinnerung, als daß wir an dieser Frage nicht in höchstem Maße beteiligt wären. Wir wissen, daß – ungeachtet der im einzelnen vielleicht begangenen politischen und militärischen Führungsfehler – die Angriffskraft unseres Heeres 1914 nicht ausgereicht hat, um rasch zum Frieden zu gelangen. Das heißt, daß wir in der Bewaffnung, Ausrüstung und Organisation nicht vermocht hatten, der feindlichen Übermacht an Zahl ein Gegengewicht an Material entgegenzustellen. Wir glaubten, ein moralisches Übergewicht über unsere Gegner zu besitzen, und mögen in diesem Glauben recht gehabt haben. Allein dieses Übergewicht hat nicht genügt, um den Krieg zu gewinnen. Für die Zukunft ist es jedenfalls geraten, außer dem sittlichen und seelischen Zustand des Volkes, der sicher von ausschlaggebender Bedeutung ist, auch dem materiellen gebührende Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken. Ein Volk, das mit dem Kampf gegen Übermacht und mehrere Fronten rechnen muß, darf nichts vernachlässigen, was seine Lage erleichtern könnte.“ (Heinz Guderian, Achtung Panzer!)\n",

Meanwhile, forever’s a long time.Tends to make one wonder why people gamble like that.There are literally dozens of each, cults and false religions. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah, again the Hebrew Roots Movement and again Roman Catholicism. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23, Galatians 3:1-3 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of cults and false religions. “I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late ALWAYS sounds better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is.A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on.(SIDE NOTE: Both the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). He’s the CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.The wrong “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm ) is only qualified to teach the new covenant (see 2 Corinthians 3:4-11 for more information). Forever’s a long time.False religions are false religions. Curses are curses (see Matthew 13:14-15, Matthew 27:25 and Romans 11:7-8 for more information on that curse put on Israel by The Lord for the higher-ups rejecting Jesus as the Messiah and instead handing Him over to the Romans to be crucified.",

Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on.<br />(SIDE NOTE: Both the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). He’s the CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.<br /><br />The wrong “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). <br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>biblehub.com/greek/509.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> ) is only qualified to teach the new covenant (see 2 Corinthians 3:4-11 for more information). Forever’s a long time.<br /><br />False religions are false religions. Curses are curses (see Matthew 13:14-15, Matthew 27:25 and Romans 11:7-8 for more information on that curse put on Israel by The Lord for the higher-ups rejecting Jesus as the Messiah and instead handing Him over to the Romans to be crucified.",
