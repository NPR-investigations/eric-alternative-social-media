Weinstein goes on to say that \"every single rabbi I know says that they don't actually believe in the Jewish God of the old testament. How can this be if Judaism is a religion?\"Rabbi Wolpe replies by saying that \"Judaism is NOT a religion.\"He says Christianity is a religion because ....\"If tomorrow I believe in Jesus, I'm Christian. If the day after I don't, I'm not. But If a Jew stops believing in the Jewish religious beliefs, he is still Jewish.\" So what are the Jewish people? Now Rabbi Wolpe has to talk in code, because it's politically forbidden to admit that Jews are a race. Rabbi Wolpe says \"I would use the word \"tribe\" but \"tribe\" has negative connotations\".So he does believe they are a \"tribe\", but he can't say that because it's politically incorrect.Ultimately Rabbi Wolpe says that the Jewish people are a \"religious family\". Of course, scientifically speaking, a racial group is basically a large extended family group.Eric Weinstein (Jewish) talking to Rabbi David Wolpe goes on to say that ....\"Judaism is effectively a breeding protocol....There's a very strange moment when you sign up for '23 and Me'...and you get a DNA test result that tells you how Jewish you are\"(at 12 min) https://youtu.be/3mSxiFUzZ-Q?t=718This is why scientists say that [Jews are a racial group.](https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/dna-links-prove-jews-are-a-race-says-genetics-expert-1.5220113)In fact, scientists studying the genetic basis for mental illnesses like to study Jews because [\"Ashkenazi Jews are considered to be an especially homogeneous group, in terms of genetics.\"](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-ashkenazi-gene-increases-schizophrenia-1.5294333)",

At the time of Melania‚Äôs birth, her parents lived in two-bedroom flat in a housing block in Sevnica; her father worked as the chauffeur for the mayor of a nearby town, and as her mother was a pattern-maker at a children's clothing factory, Melania and other children of workers participated in fashion shows that featured children‚Äôs clothing. Melania‚Äôs father was in the League of Communists of Slovenia, which espoused a policy of state atheism. As was common, however, he had his daughters (Melania and one year older Ines) secretly baptized as Catholic. Although times were lean under Communist rule, the dreams of the teenage girl of striking good looks had been ignited when Melania‚Äôs father became a traveling salesman for a state-owned car company, amassing a collection of Mercedes sedans and a \"coveted\" Maserati, and her mother was always impeccably dressed and perfectly coiffed, with the entire family living in a two-story house in Sevnica.After studying architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana for a year, Melania dropped out for a modeling career and, under her Germanized name to Melania Knauss, began modeling for fashion houses in Paris and Milan.In 1996, Melania moved to the US on a visitor‚Äôs visa and settled in Manhattan to follow her career aspirations as a model. She was featured in a sexually explicit photo shoot with another female model for a French men's magazine. She also posed nude for an American international monthly men's magazine based in New York, appearing on the cover naked except for diamond jewelry, reclining on fur, aboard her future husband‚Äôs custom-fitted Boeing 727. In 2001, while Melania was dating Donald Trump (born on June 14, 1946), she was granted permanent residency under a program for people with extraordinary abilities. In 2004, Melania and Donald became engaged, and a year later they married in an Anglican service in Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception at Mar-a-Lago estate, a resort and national historic landmark which Trump acquired in 1985.In 2006, Melania gave birth to their son, Barron William Trump. She also has four stepchildren, stepsons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and stepdaughter Ivanka Trump from Donald‚Äôs first marriage to Ivana Zeln√≠ƒçkov√°, and another stepdaughter, Tiffany Trump from Donald‚Äôs second marriage to Marla Maples.After Melania became a US citizen, Trump sponsored her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, using the chain immigration process, on the basis of which the Knavses became US citizens in 2018, five years after they acquired permanent residency.In 2010-2017, Melania embarked on a business career with two manufacturers of her jewelry and skincare products under license. In 2018, Melania‚Äôs credentials included runway shows in Europe, a cigarette billboard ad in one of New York‚Äôs squares, and a spot in the swimsuit edition of an American sports magazine, which featured her on the beach in a string bikini, hugging a six-foot inflatable whale.

The Eighth Commandment implicitly prohibits murder (stealing a life), slavery (stealing a person's freedom), adultery (stealing a spouse), humiliation (stealing dignity), and so many other sins laid out in the Bible. If there is one commandment that summarizes the other nine, this one is it. This video is part of our series on the Ten Commandments.https://www.prageru.com/video/do-not-stealTime for everyone to know who is doing it to us. Truth is like manure it doesn't do any good unless you spread it around.
