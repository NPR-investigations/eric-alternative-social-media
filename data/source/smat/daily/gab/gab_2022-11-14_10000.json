            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

LONG FORM discussion/disputation/debate of serious philosophical questions only. \r\n\r\nThis group is now private. But not exclusive. If you would like to participate, read the rules first, and then click the \"request membership\" button, and you should be added within a day or so.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## RULES\r\n---\r\n\r\n**PRINCIPLE OF CHARITY**: For those who need it explained: the 'principle of charity' means that it is *your duty* to interpret what your interlocutor says in the most reasonable possible light. It is also *your duty* to frame your own arguments in the most honest, reasonable possible fashion you can muster. The assumption on both sides, should be *good faith* debate. \"You're a moron!\" is not good faith debate. Failure to adhere to the academic principle of charity will result in removal from the group. NO EXCEPTIONS.\r\n* * *\r\n**NO SPAM**: This group is not a comedy meme channel, dumping ground for fortune cookies, or a link aggregator for your podcast. The occasional philosophy joke is fine, as are necessary links to references, but if all you do is come here to vomit cartoons, quotes, or links to other sites, you'll be removed.\r\n* * *\r\n**NO RACE-BAITING**: This group is not for defending the white race, or proving how bad the blacks are. There are plenty of other groups here for that. If you want to raise the question of race in a philosophical context, fine. We can have that discussion. But if you're only here to post videos of black people beating up white people, or to  post photos showing how much prettier white women are, you will be removed. \r\n* * *\r\n**NO PARTISAN POLITICS**: This group is not for political memes, news stories, partisan bickering, or electioneering. It doesn't matter how egregious the clip is, how awful the policy is, or how much danger we're in. There are other groups  for that. Post any of this, and you will be removed. \r\n* * * \r\n**NO CONSPIRACIES**: This group is not for exposing the Jews, the illuminati, the biderberg group, the Rothschilds, the pedos, or the globalists. There are other groups for that. Post any of this and you will be removed.\r\n* * *\r\n**NO PREACHING**: This group is not a prayer group for praising Jesus, or Buddha, or Elohim, or Vishnu, or proselytising any one religion (Christian or atheist, or otherwise). There are other groups for that. You may engage in debate from a position of belief or non-belief, and you may argue theological or ecclesiastical topics connected to fundamental metaphysics, epistemology, or ethics. But if you post devotionals or prayer cards/requests or sermons, you will be removed. \r\n* * *\r\n**NO WOO-WOO**: This group is not about ghost hunting, UFO chasing, psychic  powers, mysticism or magic. These topics may be discussed with regard to their various implications for metaphysics or epistemology. But if you post apologia from Coast to Coast AM, or anything like that, in an obvious attempt at promotion, you'll be removed. \r\n* * *\r\n**MERCY RULE**: For everything but the Principle of Charity, the first infraction will only result in post deletion. Second infraction will result in removal. For violations of the Principle of Charity, *there is no mercy*.\r\n* * * ",

A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President.

Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

          "content": "hmmm looks like Q Anon man Neonrevolting is Jew baiting on Gab to paint GAB, Christians and Conservatives as anti-Seimitic!Neon uses Soros to do it by not connecting any CFR dots. Neon plays the Jew baiting card and connects  Jewish financier Soros to a sex cult case. Soros is no more Jewish than Neon is. He is a CFR deep state 1% ruling elite inner circle member out to destroy all religions, and our freedom of religion and speech rights. He is doing this by tying Judaism with lgbtq sexual deviancy as a human right. Soros is using that nonsense to brand anyone that believes two men using each others anus as a sex organ is engaging in disordered behavior violating God's law and natural law as hateful bigots. The CFR member and corporate member financed ADL is another tool promoting the same nonsense. This is part of the CFR deep state plan to kill our freedom of religion and speech rights.Neon has me blocked because I asked him why he misdirects his 100 thousand+ followers by never connecting the CFR dots -- but emphasizing something else like Soros being Jewish and encouraging anti-Semitic comments and support. Social media bots are automated programs used to engage in social media. These bots behave in an either partially or fully autonomous fashion, and are often designed to mimic human users. While benevolent social media bots exist, many social media bots are used in dishonest and nefarious ways. Some estimates suggest that these malicious bots make up a sizable percentage of all accounts on social media.Is Neon a Social media bot?According to former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA Victor Marchetti, a limited hangout is \"spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clan-destine professionals. When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting, sometimes even volunteering, some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and dam-aging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new infor-mation that it never thinks to pursue the matter further.\" While used by the CIA and oth-er intelligence organizations, the tactic has become popularized in the corporate and political spheres.In simple terms CIA agents working on a psyop and targeting a group lie by omitting an important detail from the group so they won't know who is really responsible for the problem. If the group doesn't know who is behind something they can't think critically about how to stop them!Is @ Neon Revolting a CIA agent whose Q-game he makes a living from was made by CFR CIA honeypot game programming experts to get a great list of Q-Anon fans?The who that CFR spook investor NeonRevolt leaves out of the equation is the CFR deep state which is easily connected to the Epstein pedophile crew. Epstein is CFR deep state and so are many of his clients including CFR member President Bill Clinton. Why wouldn't NeonRevolt want to connect those dots and block me? Shouldn't the QAnon folk that bought his game ask him to explain himself?Since NeonRevolt is a GAB investor shouldn’t Anthony Torba @a look into it? They may be the cause of some of GABs problems.WHEN PAYPAL AND THE ADL TEAM UP IT’S GOODBYE FREE SPEECH via @GrrrGraphics CFR dots @TomJefferson1976PayPal was founded in part by [Trump's million dollar donator and 1% ruling elite friend Bilderberger homosexual ] Peter Thiel and Elon Musk.

This is part of the CFR deep state plan to kill our freedom of religion and speech rights.<br /><br />Neon has me blocked because I asked him why he misdirects his 100 thousand+ followers by never connecting the CFR dots -- but emphasizing something else like Soros being Jewish and encouraging anti-Semitic comments and support. <br /><br />Social media bots are automated programs used to engage in social media. These bots behave in an either partially or fully autonomous fashion, and are often designed to mimic human users. While benevolent social media bots exist, many social media bots are used in dishonest and nefarious ways. Some estimates suggest that these malicious bots make up a sizable percentage of all accounts on social media.<br /><br />Is Neon a Social media bot?<br /><br />According to former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA Victor Marchetti, a limited hangout is \"spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clan-destine professionals. When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting, sometimes even volunteering, some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and dam-aging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new infor-mation that it never thinks to pursue the matter further.\" While used by the CIA and oth-er intelligence organizations, the tactic has become popularized in the corporate and political spheres.<br /><br /><br />In simple terms CIA agents working on a psyop and targeting a group lie by omitting an important detail from the group so they won't know who is really responsible for the problem. If the group doesn't know who is behind something they can't think critically about how to stop them!<br /><br /><br />Is @ Neon Revolting a CIA agent whose Q-game he makes a living from was made by CFR CIA honeypot game programming experts to get a great list of Q-Anon fans?<br /><br /><br />The who that CFR spook investor NeonRevolt leaves out of the equation is the CFR deep state which is easily connected to the Epstein pedophile crew. Epstein is CFR deep state and so are many of his clients including CFR member President Bill Clinton. Why wouldn't NeonRevolt want to connect those dots and block me? Shouldn't the QAnon folk that bought his game ask him to explain himself?<br /><br />Since NeonRevolt is a GAB investor shouldn’t Anthony Torba <a href=\"https://gab.com/a\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@a<\/a> look into it? They may be the cause of some of GABs problems.<br /><br /><br />WHEN PAYPAL AND THE ADL TEAM UP IT’S GOODBYE FREE SPEECH via <a href=\"https://gab.com/GrrrGraphics\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@GrrrGraphics<\/a> CFR dots <a href=\"https://gab.com/TomJefferson1976\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@TomJefferson1976<\/a><br /><br />PayPal was founded in part by [Trump's million dollar donator and 1% ruling elite friend Bilderberger homosexual ] Peter Thiel and Elon Musk.
