Here in this group we want to encourage everyone to talk about all of the wonderful things Ron DeSantis has done since being elected Governor.\n\nThings like:\nOutlawing Sanctuary Cities in Florida.\nExpand Florida's E-Verify requirements.\nKeeping Florida open despite the pressure to close it again!\nPrevent local governments from fining people who don't wear masks.\nMaking sure everyone has the option of in person learning.\n\nThe list goes on and on! It is without a doubt that he needs a second term as Governor of Florida and strong consideration for President. I hope everyone enjoys! Speak freely!\n\nAlso feel free to follow me @TheGayRepublican! Much appreciated!",

In fact, the requirement to inject oneself with Pfizer BioNTech mRNA shots that are not even to this day approved by the FDA (they’re still under “emergency use authorization” if you can believe that) should never have been mandated in the first place. Adams continued:I continue to urge every New Yorker to get vaccinated, get boosted, and take the necessary steps to protect themselves and those around them from COVID-19.Any ounce of credibility Adams still had evaporated with that one sentence. Who in their right mind would be urging every New Yorker to receive a vaccine and/or booster that is ineffective and potentially dangerous? The people who are still holding on to this vaccine-as-cure-all fantasy truly seem delusional at this point.But what about the 1,780 city workers who were summarily fired when they refused the shot? Well, they won’t get back pay, for starters, and they will have to reapply if they want their old positions back. If they’re rehired, will they start at the same salary they had when they were axed? Will they retain whatever rank or seniority they had earned? It’s not clear at this point.⁦@NYCMayor⁩ not good enough people were fired, forced from their careers, homes, discriminated against or forced to put something in their body they did not want &amp; some of them were harmed. #TheFinestUnfiltered https://t.co/pdapbABfYP— John D. Macari Jr. 🇺🇸🗽 (@JohnDMacari) February 6, 2023The NY Post reports on how the mandate affected one New York firefighter:Jairo Sosa, 37, who worked for 7 1/2-years as a firefighter before his “forced resignation,” said he would love to get his job back. He has a wife and three young kids ages 5, 3, and seven months old.“It’s a great job. I love going out and serving my community. I was working in the same community I grew up in — Washington Heights,” Sosa said.He was awarded a medal in 2021 after rescuing a 5-year-old girl.“You get a medal one year then you get terminated the year after,” Sosa said.That’s just one story, but there are at least 1,779 more.NYC Mayor Eric Adams had ended the vaccine mandate for city workersHundreds of people were stripped of their livelihood for refusing this mandate over the last two years and they will NOT be reinstatedAbsolutely disgusting— Clayton Keirns (@CKeirns) February 6, 2023So much about the nation’s COVID policies on the federal, state, and local levels was outrageous and dictatorial, and firing thousands of people during one of the most trying times in their lives was flat-out wrong.Admit your mistakes, Eric Adams, and restore these people’s jobs, back pay, and seniority.New York City Mayor Eric Adamshttps://gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748Contact:http://ericadams2021.comhttps://www.facebook.com/80559174013https://www.instagram.com/ericadamsfornycPeople in PoliticsPage 1 https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087",

I was working in the same community I grew up in — Washington Heights,” Sosa said.<br /><br />He was awarded a medal in 2021 after rescuing a 5-year-old girl.<br /><br />“You get a medal one year then you get terminated the year after,” Sosa said.<br /><br />That’s just one story, but there are at least 1,779 more.<br /><br />NYC Mayor Eric Adams had ended the vaccine mandate for city workers<br /><br />Hundreds of people were stripped of their livelihood for refusing this mandate over the last two years and they will NOT be reinstated<br /><br />Absolutely disgusting<br /><br />— Clayton Keirns (@CKeirns) February 6, 2023<br /><br />So much about the nation’s COVID policies on the federal, state, and local levels was outrageous and dictatorial, and firing thousands of people during one of the most trying times in their lives was flat-out wrong.<br /><br />Admit your mistakes, Eric Adams, and restore these people’s jobs, back pay, and seniority.<br /><br />New York City Mayor Eric Adams<br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Contact:<br /><a href=\"http://ericadams2021.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>ericadams2021.com<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/80559174013\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>facebook.com/80559174013<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ericadamsfornyc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>instagram.com/ericadamsfornyc<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />People in Politics<br />Page 1 <a href=\"https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

In fact, the requirement to inject oneself with Pfizer BioNTech mRNA shots that are not even to this day approved by the FDA (they’re still under “emergency use authorization” if you can believe that) should never have been mandated in the first place. Adams continued:I continue to urge every New Yorker to get vaccinated, get boosted, and take the necessary steps to protect themselves and those around them from COVID-19.Any ounce of credibility Adams still had evaporated with that one sentence. Who in their right mind would be urging every New Yorker to receive a vaccine and/or booster that is ineffective and potentially dangerous? The people who are still holding on to this vaccine-as-cure-all fantasy truly seem delusional at this point.But what about the 1,780 city workers who were summarily fired when they refused the shot? Well, they won’t get back pay, for starters, and they will have to reapply if they want their old positions back. If they’re rehired, will they start at the same salary they had when they were axed? Will they retain whatever rank or seniority they had earned? It’s not clear at this point.⁦@NYCMayor⁩ not good enough people were fired, forced from their careers, homes, discriminated against or forced to put something in their body they did not want &amp; some of them were harmed. #TheFinestUnfiltered https://t.co/pdapbABfYP— John D.

The American Leadership &amp; Policy Foundation noted in a 2015 report written by Air Force Maj. David Stuckenberg, a top EMP expert, that such balloons are a major national security threat because of what they are capable of carrying.The report, titled “Novel High-altitude Delivery Platforms for Weapons of Mass Destruction/Weapons of Mass Effect,” notes:Can a state, pseudo-state or non-state actor(s) deliver Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)/Weapons of Mass Effect (WME) to strategically impact America’s infrastructure absent employment of Inter-continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM), SubmarineLaunched Ballistic Missiles (SBLM), or other conventional means? The answer is “yes.” Thus, the feasibility of using novel delivery platforms to achieve offensive capabilities against the United States should be examined and understood by the emergency management and national security communities.“While legacy and derivative systems such as Russia’s (oceanic multi-purpose Status-6 system) nuclear torpedo continue to present strategic threats to the U.S., their proliferation has proven somewhat predictable over time,” the report continued. “However, the rise of global terrorism has created a new dimension of risk to the U.S. in particular – one that presents itself in a chaotic, innovative and ill-defined manner.“Consequently, planners should begin addressing novel strategic threats by understanding what can be done rather than what has been done. Such an approach is critically important to protecting America’s society and critical infrastructure,” it added.“Using a balloon as a WMD/WME platform could provide adversaries with a pallet of altitudes and payload options with which to maximize offensive effects against the U.S.,” Stuckenberg wrote. “A high altitude balloon could be designed, created, and launched in a matter of months. There is nothing to prevent several hundred pounds of weapons material from being delivered to altitude.”In a short Friday interview with the Examiner, Stuckenberg said: “China’s recent balloon flyover of the United States is clearly a provocative and aggressive act. It was most likely a type of dry run meant to send a strategic message to the USA. We must not take this for granted.”Democratic and Republican lawmakers are both demanding that the Biden regime explain why the balloon was allowed to enter U.S. airspace in the first place, let alone survive after it was reported by media outlets.Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, where the balloon was first reported to be on Thursday, said he’s planning on holding a hearing of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee he chairs to get answers about the balloon incident.“Montanans value their freedom and privacy and I’ll always fight to defend both,” Tester said Friday. “China’s actions are a clear threat to those values and to America’s national security, and I’m demanding answers from the Biden Administration. I will be pulling people before my committee to get real answers on how this happened, and how we can prevent it from ever happening again.”Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) is also looking for answers after the balloon traversed his state on Friday.“I’m calling for an investigation and demanding answers from the Biden Admin. on why a Chinese spy balloon was allowed to hover over critical military infrastructure in Missouri and across the interior of the U.S. without any intervention,” he tweeted.Sources include:http://CharlieKirk.comhttp://WashingtonExaminer.comhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-06-terrifying-chinese-spy-balloons-seen-as-dry-run-for-nuclear-emp-attack.html",

Such efforts include human intelligence gathering, transnational repression schemes, cyber theft and hacking, intellectual property theft, and even the harvesting of Americans’ genetic material.In the words of one retired Air Force General, “If [the CCP has] any access to American society, then they’ll use that access to undermine American society.”HUMINT and Transnational RepressionKey among the CCP’s efforts to spy on the United States is its traditional human intelligence (HUMINT) efforts, which relies on person-to-person exchanges of information, both wittingly and otherwise.The CCP’s HUMINT network permeates American society at many levels, with many such efforts being overseen directly by the regime’s top intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS).One of the most infamous such cases is that of Christine Fang or “Fang Fang”, the alleged Chinese spy who posed as a university student, and fostered relationships with numerous politicians in California and elsewhere, including Rep. Eric Swalwell when he was a city council member, and used that access to collect intelligence on up and coming politicos. Fang reportedly targeted at least two Midwestern mayors with whom she had romantic or sexual relationships.Politicians aren’t the only targets of such espionage, however. Many everyday Americans, particularly those of Chinese descent, are frequently the preferred targets of the CCP’s spy and harassment campaigns.In such efforts, MSS agents and their U.S. proxies have allegedly stalked an American Olympic figure skater and her family, conspired with New York police officers to gather intelligence on the Asian American community, and even plotted to attack a U.S. Army veteran running for Congress in a bid to silence and intimidate people holding critical views of the CCP.FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Chinese agents and their proxies actively stalked U.S. residents and planted bugs in their cars and homes.Cyber Theft and HackingSimilarly, the regime has used cyber attacks and misinformation campaigns to illicitly collect U.S. defense information and sow division among American citizens.U.S. intelligence leaders have identified the CCP as the world’s largest malicious cyber actor, and its affiliated hackers have stolen more data from Americans than every other nation combined.Such efforts are often aimed at stealing vital technological secrets, such as when suspected state-backed agents hacked into a U.S. government department last year and stole sensitive defense information. Likewise, CCP-sponsored hackers have penetrated and stolen sensitive information from multiple U.S. telecom firms.The incidents highlight what U.S. defense officials have long warned: that the regime is studying how the United States fights with the intent of developing technologies capable of toppling its military and forcibly transferring cutting-edge American technologies to China.Americans’ sensitive personal information is also a valued target, as evidenced by multiple massive hacks by Chinese actors over the years, including the breaches of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, credit-reporting agency Equifax, Mariott hotels, and insurer Anthem. These hacks resulted in hundreds of millions of Americans’ personal data being stolen.Officials and experts have said the regime is using this massive trove of Americans’ personal data to aid in its espionage and overseas influence operations, and feed its artificial intelligence technology.Social Media and TelecommunicationsThe CCP also uses its control over the data of Chinese companies to leverage Chinese-owned social media and telecommunications giants against an unsuspecting American populace.TikTok, a popular short video app owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, is perhaps the most telling example of this.Described by intelligence leaders as a “national security threat” and labeled by security experts as a “weaponized military application,” social media giant TikTok has censored stories Americans see at the request of the CCP and has allowed its Chinese engineers access to U.S. user data. Officials have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the app because CCP law mandates Chinese companies provide data to the regime upon request.",
