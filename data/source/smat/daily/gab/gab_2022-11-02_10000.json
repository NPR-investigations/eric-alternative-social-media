Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you‚Äôll want to be sure you‚Äôre posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

L'ancien directeur de la r√©daction du Parisien, fra√Æchement d√©barqu√©, avait m√™me √©t√© invit√© par le riche homme d'affaires franco libanais √† discuter des modalit√©s √† Barbossi-Riviera, sa r√©sidence dans le Var.

Les deux hommes ont m√™me d√©fini son salaire. averti par les questions du journaliste, en coulisses, l'ami de jeunesse de Marion Mar√©chal s'affaire depuis plusieurs jours pour conserver sa place. Au cours d'un d√©jeuner avec son actionnaire, dans le VIIIe arrondissement parisien, le journaliste promet de r√©√©quilibrer la ligne de VA, de prendre de la distance avec Eric Zemmour, de d√©velopper l'enqu√™te, de privil√©gier l'information √† l'engagement...  Il n'emp√™che, gr√¢ce √† ses promesses, Geoffroy Lejeune r√©ussit √† s'accorder un sursis : Iskandar Safa l'appelle pour d√©savouer le papier de La Lettre A avant m√™me sa parution. Vendredi 21 octobre, le directeur adjoint Tugdual Denis s'entretient lui aussi avec l'actionnaire. \"Sandy\", comme il surnomme affectueusement Iskandar, le rassure. Mais les journalistes de la r√©daction ont senti le vent tourner, et se savent en sursis. En coulisses, les salari√©s de Valeurs se mobilisent autour du jeune patron qui a impos√© au fil des six derni√®res ann√©es ses hommes dans la r√©daction. Autour de lui, ses proches font bloc : Charlotte d'Ornellas, l'√©g√©rie m√©diatique de la droite r√©actionnaire. Tugdual Denis, son num√©ro deux et ami, auteur de livres remarqu√©s sur Fran√ßois Fillon et Edouard Philippe. La troupe laisse courir le bruit √ß√† et l√† qu'en cas de licenciement de leur patron, la r√©daction serait ingouvernable.Pour l'heure, les journalistes de Valeurs ont gagn√© un peu de r√©pit, m√™me si certains affirment avoir perdu quelques kilos dans la s√©quence, √† cause du stress. Selon Geoffroy Lejeune, l'op√©ration aurait permis au journal de recruter pr√®s de 2 000 abonn√©s en une semaine. Un chiffre bien loin d'assurer la survie du titre d'extr√™me droite. Jean-Michel Salvator, lui, a fait savoir √† l'actionnaire qu'il n'√©tait plus candidat. Iskandar Safa ne lui a jamais r√©pondu.",

Au cours d'un d√©jeuner avec son actionnaire, dans le VIIIe arrondissement parisien, le journaliste promet de r√©√©quilibrer la ligne de VA, de prendre de la distance avec Eric Zemmour, de d√©velopper l'enqu√™te, de privil√©gier l'information √† l'engagement...  <br /><br />Il n'emp√™che, gr√¢ce √† ses promesses, Geoffroy Lejeune r√©ussit √† s'accorder un sursis : Iskandar Safa l'appelle pour d√©savouer le papier de La Lettre A avant m√™me sa parution. Vendredi 21 octobre, le directeur adjoint Tugdual Denis s'entretient lui aussi avec l'actionnaire. \"Sandy\", comme il surnomme affectueusement Iskandar, le rassure. Mais les journalistes de la r√©daction ont senti le vent tourner, et se savent en sursis. <br /><br />En coulisses, les salari√©s de Valeurs se mobilisent autour du jeune patron qui a impos√© au fil des six derni√®res ann√©es ses hommes dans la r√©daction. Autour de lui, ses proches font bloc : Charlotte d'Ornellas, l'√©g√©rie m√©diatique de la droite r√©actionnaire. Tugdual Denis, son num√©ro deux et ami, auteur de livres remarqu√©s sur Fran√ßois Fillon et Edouard Philippe. La troupe laisse courir le bruit √ß√† et l√† qu'en cas de licenciement de leur patron, la r√©daction serait ingouvernable.<br /><br />Pour l'heure, les journalistes de Valeurs ont gagn√© un peu de r√©pit, m√™me si certains affirment avoir perdu quelques kilos dans la s√©quence, √† cause du stress. Selon Geoffroy Lejeune, l'op√©ration aurait permis au journal de recruter pr√®s de 2 000 abonn√©s en une semaine. Un chiffre bien loin d'assurer la survie du titre d'extr√™me droite. Jean-Michel Salvator, lui, a fait savoir √† l'actionnaire qu'il n'√©tait plus candidat. Iskandar Safa ne lui a jamais r√©pondu.",

Under pressure from the right, Paris is ‚Äúchanging gear,‚Äù Darmanin said.The bill will be debated in parliament in early 2023. While its specific provisions remain to be hammered out, the minister said that it will allow the police and courts to punish criminal aliens more effectively, while making it easier for legal immigrants to obtain work permits to shore up the country‚Äôs labor demand.One of its measures, Darmanin explained, will strip away three-quarters of the existing grounds for illegal immigrants to appeal deportation orders. The government will also remove access to social services for those set to be deported, remove rules barring long-term residents from deportation, and force the local authorities to act on expulsion orders.According to Le Monde, France issued 122,000 expulsion orders in 2021 but only enforced 3,200 in the last two years. Although foreigners make up 7% of the French population, they are responsible for 19% of crimes, according to figures cited by both Darmanin and French President Emmanuel Macron. In Paris, foreigners are responsible for half of all crimes.While pro-migrant activists say that many of these crimes are trivial, the latest push to tighten up immigration law comes after the body of a 12-year-old girl was found in a suitcase in Paris with her throat cut last month. The suspect, charged with raping and murdering the schoolgirl, is an Algerian woman who had been issued a deportation order two months previously.With right-wing politician Eric Zemmour describing the murder as ‚ÄúFrancocide‚Äù and National Rally leader Marine Le Pen demanding that the government stop ‚Äúout-of-control illegal immigration,‚Äù Darmanin said that by tackling the problem, he would seek to deny the right ‚Äúpolitical fuel.‚Äù‚ÄúIt is up to us to enact the strong ‚Äì sometimes even hardline ‚Äì measures that the French want or need, otherwise others will do it for us,‚Äù he added.Macron has long been pressed by the right to harden his immigration policies, as migrant camps became a familiar sight on Paris streets under his leadership.

This was decades ago and when she was saying these things, it was a big no-no. My great-grandmother told me Vikings were in the states in the early 90s and 80s. She passed away at nearly 90 in the 90s. This is significant because when she made these claims, it was thought to be bogus information about the Vikings. This was a Mormon woman who grew up in the wild west. She had no business with Viking stories in America or to know of them. This was mostly Mexico when my family got here. This means her family must have come over with the Mormon Caravans. The perfect place to hide for these people. Me and My husband's families were out west during the wild west. This too is rare. We both have Celtic blood. I'm also Italian and English. Hence my passion for art and philosophy.The locations of the Vikings magic forest and their giants settlements put them in only a few locations, New Zealand can be eliminated because the red-haired and blonde ancients didn't arrive until after the fact. Asia has similar mummies, but not boats. The pacific Islander boats pictured here may have been inspired by canoes but appear more Viking. once more showing a connection between Vikings and the states.Viking boats look just like that. The plot thickens. I believe in the bible, but much like the Kennedy assassination took place but was recorded by history incorrectly. This is an aged old tactic that has been in use since before the bible was written. The Vikings may have had ties to an ancient people that knew the truth about something. https://studyfinds.org/vikings-asia-dna-surprising-origins/Now both Native Americans and Asians say they were here first in the west. It should be no surprise that white mummies have been found with blonde and red hair in both regions, Asia and America, and also Africa. I believe these are the original Viking groups. This proves that there were ancient white races that were never European or middle eastern. The dates for these ancient white groups are old, really old. Given how settled they were and known to be more loving than not, they were there in those regions during the floods. And they were spreading out perhaps looking for answers to the floods or population increases.There is heavy Celtic, Native American, and Asian influence in my bloodline. The things I was taught as a child are dangerously close to these ancient beliefs, all the way down to cutting your hair on a full moon. I was taught how to make pottery and bead crafts with the same tiny beads and I have a huge collection of those same beads. I still love making ceramics and want a kiln to make my own. In 2021 I even had a paranormal encounter similar to what Jesus claimed to have. I have always known the cat was my spirit animal. Searching for your ancestors is one of the most important things we can do in this life. If you want to find God you need to find out who you really are first. The Bible is not a farse it's real, but it's the details that are changed around.Just as the things taking place right now are more complicated than left or right, so are the lies in the bible. Oswald was killed as he was claiming to be set up by a deep state after Kennedy's murder. We all know it was not how we were told, did anyone ever think the bible is similar? Has anyone ever looked to see where this type of control came from? Maybe we should be more focused on history than on tabloids. If we expose the raw truth historically we can free ourselves from tyranny, all legal and non-violent. We have to demand these powers that be to open the Vatican catacombs, the Smithsonian, and the 4000 old sealed temples that dot the globe. Let us find out who we really are.If you control the history of who we are you can control the human race. That's just what these organizations do. They tell us who we are but won't let us see because we aren't as close to God as they are...",

She had no business with Viking stories in America or to know of them. This was mostly Mexico when my family got here. This means her family must have come over with the Mormon Caravans. The perfect place to hide for these people. Me and My husband's families were out west during the wild west. This too is rare. We both have Celtic blood. I'm also Italian and English. Hence my passion for art and philosophy.<br /><br />The locations of the Vikings magic forest and their giants settlements put them in only a few locations, New Zealand can be eliminated because the red-haired and blonde ancients didn't arrive until after the fact. Asia has similar mummies, but not boats. The pacific Islander boats pictured here may have been inspired by canoes but appear more Viking. once more showing a connection between Vikings and the states.<br /><br />Viking boats look just like that. The plot thickens. I believe in the bible, but much like the Kennedy assassination took place but was recorded by history incorrectly. This is an aged old tactic that has been in use since before the bible was written. The Vikings may have had ties to an ancient people that knew the truth about something. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://studyfinds.org/vikings-asia-dna-surprising-origins/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>studyfinds.org/vikings-asia-dna-surprising-or<span class=\"invisible\">igins/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />Now both Native Americans and Asians say they were here first in the west. It should be no surprise that white mummies have been found with blonde and red hair in both regions, Asia and America, and also Africa. I believe these are the original Viking groups. This proves that there were ancient white races that were never European or middle eastern. The dates for these ancient white groups are old, really old. Given how settled they were and known to be more loving than not, they were there in those regions during the floods. And they were spreading out perhaps looking for answers to the floods or population increases.<br /><br />There is heavy Celtic, Native American, and Asian influence in my bloodline. The things I was taught as a child are dangerously close to these ancient beliefs, all the way down to cutting your hair on a full moon. I was taught how to make pottery and bead crafts with the same tiny beads and I have a huge collection of those same beads. I still love making ceramics and want a kiln to make my own. In 2021 I even had a paranormal encounter similar to what Jesus claimed to have. I have always known the cat was my spirit animal. Searching for your ancestors is one of the most important things we can do in this life. If you want to find God you need to find out who you really are first. The Bible is not a farse it's real, but it's the details that are changed around.<br /><br />Just as the things taking place right now are more complicated than left or right, so are the lies in the bible. Oswald was killed as he was claiming to be set up by a deep state after Kennedy's murder. We all know it was not how we were told, did anyone ever think the bible is similar? Has anyone ever looked to see where this type of control came from? Maybe we should be more focused on history than on tabloids. If we expose the raw truth historically we can free ourselves from tyranny, all legal and non-violent. We have to demand these powers that be to open the Vatican catacombs, the Smithsonian, and the 4000 old sealed temples that dot the globe. Let us find out who we really are.<br /><br />If you control the history of who we are you can control the human race. That's just what these organizations do. They tell us who we are but won't let us see because we aren't as close to God as they are...",
