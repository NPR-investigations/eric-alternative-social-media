God is good and His mercy endures forever!\n***\nBy posting you are agreeing to our posting standards, and anything that violates them will be removed.\n***\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\n***\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \n***\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\n3. Low effort (a link without adequate description of what we will find when clicking said link; and, no, a sentence is rarely sufficient) or multiple posts in a row (any more than one post in a 3 hour time period results in the keeping of the most recent post and removal of the older until the time period is met)\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\n7. All members who block the administrators will be removed.\n***\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\n***\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

It happened on this day, April 20, 1999. When Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold began shooting up their school, they did not fire randomly. In their twisted minds, Athletes, minorities and Christians were the enemy.<br />\"Do you believe in God?\" they asked Cassie Bernall. They knew full well she did. The girl who had once indulged in the occult (as the killers now did) had moved into a realm of peace when she learned to center her heart on Christ. She became a church-goer and a worker among those who needed Christ. Often she brought her Bible to school.<br />She was reading it in the library when the killer pointed his gun at her. Did she believe in God? \"Yes, I believe in God,\" she replied.<br />\"Why?\" asked the boy in the dark trench coat. Without waiting for an answer, he pulled the trigger.<br />\"My God, my granddaughter was a martyr,\" said Cassie's grandma when she heard the report.<br />And not the only one, either. Rachel Scott, a spiritually-minded seventeen-year-old whose ambition was to become a missionary to Africa, died, too. So did John Tomlin, a sixteen-year-old who had recently gone to Mexico to help with a church project for the poor.<br />The Sunday before her death, Cassie wrote these words after church:<br />Now I have given up on everything else I have found it to be the only way<br />To really know Christ and to experience<br />The mighty power that brought Him back to life again, and to find<br />Out what it means to suffer and to<br />Die with him.<br />So, whatever it takes I will be one who lives in the fresh<br />Newness of life of those who are<br />Alive from the dead.<br /><br />Bibliography:<br />Colson, Charles W. \"Littleton's Martyrs.\" BreakPoint Commentary - April 26, 1999.

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this.

He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs.All of our oceans and lakes do actually survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth, only Earth quakes. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored.Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, other lands beyond Antarctica ?This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language). Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers.This group has never, and will never, ask for a dime from anyone.

            "description_html": "<ul><li>- - WARNING - - - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking.Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"/tags/FakeNewsMedia\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#FakeNewsMedia<\/a> and gov&#39;t education. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs.All of our oceans and lakes do actually survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth, only Earth quakes. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored.Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it&#39;s an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The &quot;Antarctic Treaty&quot; prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, other lands beyond Antarctica ?This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language). Accounts set to &#39;Private&#39;, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers.This group has never, and will never, ask for a dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the multitudes of facts with undeniable evidence evoking our true Level and Stationary Earth Plane. Truth is like a breath of fresh air, Truth will break you free from the Echo Chamber of Deception.<br /><\/li><\/ul>",

RNC is so enraged Moore won, they used the Kosher media (abc, nbc, cnn, foxnews) to smear Moore 24/7 for asking out a few 16 or 17 year olds like 45 years ago?

You can give the man begging for money a dollar (or five or ten) to buy a cup of coffee, but even if he does buy the coffee and something to eat, before the day is out he will be hungry again. Unless there is a change in his consciousness, unless he awakens to the Truth about his own relationship with the Universe and gets in tune with his own unique flow of supply from within, nothing has really changed. Poverty programs must begin to think “hand-up” instead of “handout.” The poverty of any society can be controlled, but only as people are introduced to the idea expressed by Emerson that every person “is an inlet and may become an outlet to all there is in God.” The prospering element will always be nonmaterial substance. And there can never be a shortage of this substance in the Universe. Even within an apparent condition of indigence, the only lack in terms of the principle is the thought of lack. You are always as rich as you think you are and the only poverty is of the mind. So you can begin to do something about your financial position in life by reshaping your attitudes about yourself, about money in general, and about your work or investments as the source of your money in particular.\"~ Eric Butterworth",

It was a twisted variation of the old head-trip Let’s You and Him Fight — described so well in psychologist Eric Berne’s classic book Games People Play. It’s a game instigated generally by women. The West detests the actual Mr. Putin for systemically and doggedly having to correct the mischief that the USA set in motion there in 2014 — putting out a dumpster fire we kept feeding for eight years.Mainly we hate the Russian president for doing what he said he would do, acting like a man, literally having to set boundaries for the unruly children, like Daddy used to do. America hates daddies. To America, all daddies are monsters (rapists!). That’s why America wants to turn all daddies into mommies. Anyway, we barely remember what daddies used to do. The context for daddies — the family — has been obliterated in America by every agency and institution in the land. The only role available these days is the chimerical creature known as a “baby daddy,” which is as much a baby as a daddy, developmentally speaking. Real daddies are men, which is to say: not babies. Mr. Putin acts like a man, especially having to do a dirty job that needs doing, without complaint. America can’t stand that.https://kunstler.com/clusterfuck-nation/daddies-in-mommie-land/",

Quite literally the establishments worst nightmare.One problem... she got 70% of the vote. Taking her down will not be easy.It started last summer when their planted \"Patriots\" starting to sow seeds of doubt... attacking her... trying to split us on MTG from within. This is how they always start. Anyone who's been at this for a while has seen them attempt this with Trump many times. It's called a \"Concern Troll\" . It's the oldest trick in the book and typically only snags the newly awakened with vague connections and pseudo \"sauce\" that can typically be attributed to many and only seems dire when presented as such. Now that this poisoning of well has been underway for nearly a year they have started the 2nd part of their attack. Using the Media and the Courts in a very public Attack. (Kickem when they're down) just ask Eric Holder... Well, I fully believe that they will not succeed in this laughable (and predictable) attempt to remove one of our Greatest Warriors from Congress.

COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the United States in 2021, according to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).    The data illustrate the toll from the virus, with 415,000 COVID-19 deaths last year. Coronavirus was the leading cause of death behind heart disease, with 693,000 deaths, and cancer, at 605,000 deaths.    COVID-19 was also the third-leading cause of death in 2020, but the number of deaths from the virus actually increased in 2021, with 60,000 more deaths than 2020.   The continued toll from the virus comes even as vaccines have been widely available since last spring, but many Americans did not get vaccinated  “Covid shouldn’t even be in the top 10 causes of death in the US if we consistently used all the tools available,” tweeted Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research. “Yet we’re still now losing the lives of 500 Americans each day.” COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death for 415,000 people last year, and when deaths where COVID-19 was a contributing factor are counted too, that number increases to 460,000.

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth.

We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they&#39;re Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov&#39;t education. Let&#39;s examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We&#39;ve shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth.

Defending our border was obviously no priority!--Republican Governors Doug Ducey, Greg Abbott and dozens more announced on Wednesday the formation of the American Governors’ Border Strike Force, a multi-state effort to combat the influx of illegal immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border caused by President Joe Biden’s “disastrous border policies.”A news release from the Republican Governors Association stated that 26 GOP governors have joined the partnership “designed to disrupt and dismantle the transnational criminal organizations taking advantage of the chaos Joe Biden has created along the southern border.”The strike force’s plan is to target cartels and other criminal organizations by bolstering collaboration, intelligence, and analysis with the goal of “combating human smuggling, and stopping drug flow among each of the participating states.”The association asserted that Biden’s “reckless immigration policies” coupled with “the lack of adequate federal resources” have led to the unprecedented flow of illegal immigration and criminal operations along the southern border.“Every state is a border state, dealing with the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into states across America,” the release stated.The governors involved in the partnership include: Doug Ducey (AZ), Greg Abbott (TX), Kay Ivey (AL), Mike Dunleavy (AK), Asa Hutchinson (AR), Ron DeSantis (FL), Brian Kemp (GA), Brad Little (ID), Eric Holcomb (IN), Kim Reynolds (IA), Larry Hogan (MD), Tate Reeves (MS), Mike Parson (MO), Greg Gianforte (MT), Pete Ricketts (NE), Chris Sununu (NH), Doug Burgum (ND), Mike DeWine (OH), Kevin Stitt (OK), Henry McMaster (SC), Kristi Noem (SD), Bill Lee (TN), Spencer Cox (UT), Glenn Youngkin (VA), Jim Justice (WV), and Mark Gordon (WY).“What we’re doing in Arizona works. But this is not just an Arizona issue, it’s a national issue. If our entire southern border isn’t secure, our nation isn’t secure,” Gov. Ducey said in a statement.“As dangerous transnational criminal organizations continue to profit from holes in the border and fill our communities with drugs, it’s no coincidence that we’re seeing historic levels of opioid-related deaths,” he continued. “The American Governors’ Border Strike Force will serve as a force multiplier in the fight against criminal activity directly tied to our border.

Defending our border was obviously no priority!--\n\nRepublican Governors Doug Ducey, Greg Abbott and dozens more announced on Wednesday the formation of the American Governors’ Border Strike Force, a multi-state effort to combat the influx of illegal immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border caused by President Joe Biden’s “disastrous border policies.”\n\nA news release from the Republican Governors Association stated that 26 GOP governors have joined the partnership “designed to disrupt and dismantle the transnational criminal organizations taking advantage of the chaos Joe Biden has created along the southern border.”\n\nThe strike force’s plan is to target cartels and other criminal organizations by bolstering collaboration, intelligence, and analysis with the goal of “combating human smuggling, and stopping drug flow among each of the participating states.”\n\nThe association asserted that Biden’s “reckless immigration policies” coupled with “the lack of adequate federal resources” have led to the unprecedented flow of illegal immigration and criminal operations along the southern border.\n\n“Every state is a border state, dealing with the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into states across America,” the release stated.\n\nThe governors involved in the partnership include: Doug Ducey (AZ), Greg Abbott (TX), Kay Ivey (AL), Mike Dunleavy (AK), Asa Hutchinson (AR), Ron DeSantis (FL), Brian Kemp (GA), Brad Little (ID), Eric Holcomb (IN), Kim Reynolds (IA), Larry Hogan (MD), Tate Reeves (MS), Mike Parson (MO), Greg Gianforte (MT), Pete Ricketts (NE), Chris Sununu (NH), Doug Burgum (ND), Mike DeWine (OH), Kevin Stitt (OK), Henry McMaster (SC), Kristi Noem (SD), Bill Lee (TN), Spencer Cox (UT), Glenn Youngkin (VA), Jim Justice (WV), and Mark Gordon (WY).\n\n“What we’re doing in Arizona works. But this is not just an Arizona issue, it’s a national issue. If our entire southern border isn’t secure, our nation isn’t secure,” Gov. Ducey said in a statement.\n\n“As dangerous transnational criminal organizations continue to profit from holes in the border and fill our communities with drugs, it’s no coincidence that we’re seeing historic levels of opioid-related deaths,” he continued. “The American Governors’ Border Strike Force will serve as a force multiplier in the fight against criminal activity directly tied to our border. My thanks to my fellow governors who saw the problem and chose to be part of the solution.”\n\nhttps://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/04/26-state-governors-announce-new-border-strike-force/",

A five-judge appellate court panel agreed with Republicans and the case is expected to go to the state Court of Appeals, The New York Times reported.&quot;Like other state courts around the country, New York courts aren&#39;t finding the question of whether a map is a partisan gerrymander a particularly hard one to decide,&quot; Brennan Center for Justice&#39;s Michael Li told the Times. &quot;It&#39;s very hard to defend a map like New York&#39;s, and ultimately if it quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck.&quot;Republicans are not going to move to strike the state Legislature-drawn maps, according to plaintiffs&#39; spokesman John Faso, who called Thursday&#39;s decision a &quot;great victory.&quot;The district lines are crucial to the November midterm elections and, in a deep-blue state of New York, Democrats hoped a big victory in the state would help stem the widely anticipated red wave through the U.S.The panel ruled Democrats drew the maps under review &quot;to discourage competition and favor Democrats&quot; and they knowingly ignored the ban on partisan gerrymandering, according to the Times.&quot;We are satisfied that petitioners established beyond a reasonable doubt that the Legislature acted with partisan intent in violation&quot; of a constitutional statute from 2014, according to three judges on the panel in the majority opinion. Two dissented in the minority.The New York Court of Appeals has judges all appointed by Democrat governors and it has indicted it could make a final determination in the case as soon as next week, the Times reported.Senate Democratic spokesman Mike Murphy believes the court will ultimately permit the Democrat-drawn lines to stand.&quot;We always knew this case would end at the Court of Appeals and look forward to being heard on our appeal to uphold the congressional map as well,&quot; he told the Times.The ruling Thursday orders the Democrat-led Legislature to redraw the district maps by April 30 or leave the process to a court-appointed neutral expert. The ruling did not weigh in on whether the June primaries should be delayed until August, the Times reported.The Democrats&#39; maps handed their party a clear edge in 22 of the state&#39;s 26 districts, despite the fact Republicans currently hold eight House seats.",

Ces gens se croyaient en terrain conquis avec leurs juifs magiques « de droite », les Goldnadel et compagnie.La fin de la campagne de Zemmour a été d’un niveau de sémitisme jamais vu, entre les tramways antisémites de Rieu et le voyage en Israël de Cheveux Gras dit « Collard ».C’était une candidature de juifs pour des juifs.On a senti à la fin que tout ce sémitisme contenu jusque-là avec grande difficulté a surgi dans une sorte de transe libératoire.J’y vois la main de la juive Knafo qui se voyait déjà, à la veille du premier tour, reine de la France juive.Au moins maintenant, les choses sont claires pour ce qui concerne la « démocratie » électorale : le patriotisme créole de la femme à chats Le Pen ou le turbo hébraïsme bancaire de Macron.

Comme c’est supposément son « retour politique », le désastre programmé couronne une fois de plus la nullité insigne de cette gonzesse qui n’a jamais existé que parce que des orbiters la font exister.<br /><br />Il y a deux choses de spectaculaire avec Marion Auque : c’est à quel point elle a vieilli en seulement un an et l’arrogance snobe et cassante qu’elle affiche désormais systématiquement, comme une diva usée à qui on devrait tout.<br /><br />Marion Maréchal<br />\"Il y a quelque chose de surprenant à vouloir fermer radicalement la porte à des gens qui ont appelé à voter pour vous et de vouloir absolument l’ouvrir à des personnalités comme Arnaud @montebourg, immigrationniste de gauche, qui appelle à voter Emmanuel Macron.\" <a href=\"/tags/ApollineMatin\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#ApollineMatin<\/a><br /><br /><br />Le « retour politique » de cette instagrammeuse aura duré de mars 2022 à juin 2022.<br /><br />C’est le seul retour de l’île d’Elbe que la Fronsse peut se payer, ce qui est tout de même une baisse qualitative très nette.<br /><br />Elle va prétexter l’escroquerie du « metapolitique » pour se recycler dans un autre attrape-couillons.<br /><br />Je ne suis pas mécontent de voir se faire pulvériser la droite ultra enjuivée de Valeurs Actuelles et consorts qui misait sur cette femme. Ces gens se croyaient en terrain conquis avec leurs juifs magiques « de droite », les Goldnadel et compagnie.<br /><br />La fin de la campagne de Zemmour a été d’un niveau de sémitisme jamais vu, entre les tramways antisémites de Rieu et le voyage en Israël de Cheveux Gras dit « Collard ».<br /><br />C’était une candidature de juifs pour des juifs.<br /><br />On a senti à la fin que tout ce sémitisme contenu jusque-là avec grande difficulté a surgi dans une sorte de transe libératoire.<br /><br />J’y vois la main de la juive Knafo qui se voyait déjà, à la veille du premier tour, reine de la France juive.<br /><br />Au moins maintenant, les choses sont claires pour ce qui concerne la « démocratie » électorale : le patriotisme créole de la femme à chats Le Pen ou le turbo hébraïsme bancaire de Macron. Il n’y a rien entre les deux – hormis l’islamo-marxisme de Mélenchon.",
