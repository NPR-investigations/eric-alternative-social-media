God is good and His mercy endures forever!\n***\nBy posting you are agreeing to our posting standards, and anything that violates them will be removed.\n***\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\n***\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \n***\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\n3. Low effort (a link without adequate description of what we will find when clicking said link; and, no, a sentence is rarely sufficient) or multiple posts in a row (any more than one post in a 3 hour time period results in the keeping of the most recent post and removal of the older until the time period is met)\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\n7. All members who block the administrators will be removed.\n***\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\n***\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

It's ridiculous that she makes more money off Tik Tok than many energetic, educated adults. Clown world!\"TikTok star Ava Majury and her parents have defended selling her selfies to the stalker who tried to kill her and was shot dead by her father last July, and revealed she will stay on the site where she makes $1,700-a-video despite safety risksAva Majury, her retired cop father Rob and her mother Kimberly appeared on Good Morning America on Friday to share more details about the shooting at their home in Naples, Florida, last July, after telling their story first to The New York Times. Last July, 18-year-old Eric Rohan Justin traveled from Ellicott City, Maryland, to Naples with a gun, intent on killing Ava. At 4.30am, he blasted open the front door of the family home.He had been vying for her attention on TikTok for months, bought her phone number from her friends and had paid them for pictures of her that were not on the internet. Ava also had direct contact with him and sold him two selfies for $300 which he paid her for via Venmo.  'After talking to both my parents, I thought it would be mutual if I got in contact with him directly. I said, \"hey, can you stop going through my friends and stop contacting people for information about me just come straight to me and you can purchase it all from me.\"'He then started asking for more explicit content, and that is when Rob - her father - became involved. Rob told Eric to remember that Ava was a minor, and to stop contacting her. She blocked him but he continued sending her money - $159.18, then $100, and then $368.50. It's unclear how much time passed between then and Eric showing up at the family home.When Eric showed up at the house in the middle of the night and shot open the door, Ava, her mother and her two brothers ran to a bedroom but her father Rob, a retired Jersey City police officer, grabbed his gun and went to the front of the home where he shot Justin. The teenager - who has never been pictured - died in the hospital.",

Miles, 35, allegedly communicated sexually explicit texts with a person who said they were a 13-year-old boy. He allegedly made plans for the boy to meet him at Le Meridien Columbus hotel, which is how and where the \"Predator Catchers\" group interviewed him. Miles serves on the board of directors for LGBTQ+ group, Equality California. He has since completely deleted his social media accounts on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Miles previously worked as the Director of Community Affairs for Lyft, according to an archive on LinkedIn. Eric Schmutte, the man recording the live stream and one-half of \"Predator Catchers Indianapolis,\" tells me he is sending all the chat logs and evidence to law enforcement in Columbus, Ohio and Palm Springs, Calif., where Miles purportedly lives.

Instead, what America should attempt is what race and ethnicity scholar Eric Kaufman has referred to as a “whiteshift,” wherein many Americans with multiethnic backgrounds will come to adopt the mores and traditions of, and to identify with, America’s founders and history.In an article that is pretty good about the reality of White dispossession, even going so far as to allude to William Gayley Simpson's Which Way Western Man?, the author decides that the solution to White dispossession is to make 'being white' less of a liability for part-Whites.White Americans have gone from 90% of the population to 57% of the population in the US in 30 years and the solution is...wait for it...to do something about non-White people not feeling White.The author then goes to - may the Divine order have no mercy upon him - to talk about Hungary and the non-existent Magyars whose culture the Hungarians supposedly reproduce without the benefit of race.Of course, since the Magyars no longer exist as a discrete race, not one of them is around to object to this situation.And this is supposed to make White people feel that it's okay that their homelands have been overwhelmed by non-Whites and that anti-White sentiment grows year after year unabated and abetted by (((elites)))?This is why 'conservatism' is a dead-end for self-respecting North American Whites.This 'conservative' can get the diagnosis right, but the remedy is so inadequate as to be an insult.'Conservatives' only care about White people if we cause them problems by being 'racist'.Otherwise, we can just disappear from the face of the earth and they're fine with it.'Conservatism' isn't pro-White.It never has been.It's just a different version of anti-White.https://americanmind.org/features/replace-the-ruling-class/end-mass-immigration-and-white-stigamatization-to-boost-assimilation/",

They must provide 45 days’ notice of any trade and secure approval of such trades. And they will have to provide public notice of any trades made in the previous 30 days.Chair Jerome Powell announced the rules in October after ethics questions engulfed several high-ranking policymakers about trades they had made in securities that stood to be affected by Fed actions at the time.

As a result, the trades raised the possibility of conflicts of interest, because the two officials could have profited from the Fed’s actions.The new rules will also cover senior vice presidents at the Fed’s 12 regional banks, research directors at the regional banks and senior staff members at the Fed in Washington as well as their spouses.
