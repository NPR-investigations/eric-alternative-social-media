          "content": "Land of the Resting Bitch FacesThe Matriarchy meets the TransarchyDonald JeffriesMar 15https://donaldjeffries.substack.com/p/land-of-the-resting-bitch-facesWhen I was a clueless youth, back in the 1970s and 1980s, there were lots of females that we called “bitches.” Probably even more females called each other “bitches.” Most of them seemed to revel in their bitchiness. Some of them clearly enjoyed rolling their eyes, and bestowing a devastating rejection on some smitten male admirer.I never was attracted to these types of girls. I’m sorry, I still call females “girls” when they’re obviously grown women. It’s probably a hate crime, but it’s a byproduct of having lived a long time in America 1.0. I think they get upset now if you call actual little girls “girls.” They prefer “young women” instead, even if they’re eight years old. Well, that was in the days before Transgenderism changed the whole dynamic. Now they don’t like the word “girl” for an entirely different reason. So, basically the word “girl” is pretty much forbidden now. It’s either sexist and demeaning, or it’s a gender restrictive term that is offensive to the massive transgender community.Note the one thing that intimidating females, soy boys, the explosion of transgenderism, and the “Warp Speed” vaccine have in common is; a guarantee that the population numbers will decline. This is what the eugenicists have long wanted. If most boys are afraid of most girls, and/or most girls don’t want most boys, there will be less babies born. If more boys become girls, and girls become boys, babies become impossible, despite what the professors and celebrities say. And if an untested vaccine damages the reproductive organs, as the COVID vaccines most assuredly have, then birth numbers will plunge, as again is already the case.But to get back to toxic feminism, which ruled the culture in the days before Transgenderism. I think I was about the only one to notice how the girls (or women if you prefer) were constantly depicted in films and TV shows as being able to beat up the boys (men). Mary Tyler Moore easily exercising a perfect judo flip on hapless Dick Van Dyke. Wilma and Betty judo flipping Fred and Barney on The Flintstones. Lily Munster easily defeating her hapless seven foot plus husband Herman in arm wrestling, and then knocking him out with one punch. Eric Cartman being punched out by little Wendy on the most politically incorrect cartoon of them all, South Park. They were certainly politically correct on that issue.For decades, the single most prevalent theme coming out of nearly every film in Hollywood was some 100 pound actress punching out, or head butting, or roundhouse kicking some much larger male, who was often fully armed. Unlike millions of presumably cuckable males that find this theme enticing, I always blanched at it. And when they weren’t beating males up, they were sexually humiliating them.

          "contentraw": "Land of the Resting Bitch Faces<br />The Matriarchy meets the Transarchy<br />Donald Jeffries<br />Mar 15<br /><a href=\"https://donaldjeffries.substack.com/p/land-of-the-resting-bitch-faces\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>donaldjeffries.substack.com/p/land-of-the-res<span class=\"invisible\">ting-bitch-faces<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />When I was a clueless youth, back in the 1970s and 1980s, there were lots of females that we called “bitches.” Probably even more females called each other “bitches.” Most of them seemed to revel in their bitchiness. Some of them clearly enjoyed rolling their eyes, and bestowing a devastating rejection on some smitten male admirer.<br /><br />I never was attracted to these types of girls. I’m sorry, I still call females “girls” when they’re obviously grown women. It’s probably a hate crime, but it’s a byproduct of having lived a long time in America 1.0. I think they get upset now if you call actual little girls “girls.” They prefer “young women” instead, even if they’re eight years old. Well, that was in the days before Transgenderism changed the whole dynamic. Now they don’t like the word “girl” for an entirely different reason. So, basically the word “girl” is pretty much forbidden now. It’s either sexist and demeaning, or it’s a gender restrictive term that is offensive to the massive transgender community.<br /><br />Note the one thing that intimidating females, soy boys, the explosion of transgenderism, and the “Warp Speed” vaccine have in common is; a guarantee that the population numbers will decline. This is what the eugenicists have long wanted. If most boys are afraid of most girls, and/or most girls don’t want most boys, there will be less babies born. If more boys become girls, and girls become boys, babies become impossible, despite what the professors and celebrities say. And if an untested vaccine damages the reproductive organs, as the COVID vaccines most assuredly have, then birth numbers will plunge, as again is already the case.<br /><br />But to get back to toxic feminism, which ruled the culture in the days before Transgenderism. I think I was about the only one to notice how the girls (or women if you prefer) were constantly depicted in films and TV shows as being able to beat up the boys (men). Mary Tyler Moore easily exercising a perfect judo flip on hapless Dick Van Dyke. Wilma and Betty judo flipping Fred and Barney on The Flintstones. Lily Munster easily defeating her hapless seven foot plus husband Herman in arm wrestling, and then knocking him out with one punch. Eric Cartman being punched out by little Wendy on the most politically incorrect cartoon of them all, South Park. They were certainly politically correct on that issue.<br /><br />For decades, the single most prevalent theme coming out of nearly every film in Hollywood was some 100 pound actress punching out, or head butting, or roundhouse kicking some much larger male, who was often fully armed. Unlike millions of presumably cuckable males that find this theme enticing, I always blanched at it. And when they weren’t beating males up, they were sexually humiliating them. When the world’s biggest sex symbol, Raquel Welch, starred in a rare X-rated mainstream film, Myra Breckinridge, in 1970, my horny fourteen year old self naturally assumed we’d finally see this sex symbol naked on screen. Guess again. Instead, she bent some cowboy over, pulled down his pants, and pegged him. She didn’t show a thing.",

We have no interest in being a group that is 5 miles wide and 2 inches deep.

If you are looking for deeper insights on where we really are on the prophetic timeline, then this may be a group you want to join.   If you are waiting to be raptured away before the tribulation begins, just before the real Christians will likely have to suffer persecution for their faith, you probably won't want to join this group.

Smith将軍の事務所の関係者がReal Raw Newsに語った。スラウイは、プランデミックの間、ほとんどレーダーの下を飛んでいた。メディアは彼の名前をほとんど取り上げず、ファウチ、ビルクス、コリンズといった世間に影響力のある人物や、英語が堪能な公務員の名前を取り上げた。私たちの情報筋によれば、スラウイがメディアから排除されたのは、彼が胡散臭く見え、アメリカ人に信用されないと管理局が考えたからだという。そして、グラクソ・スミスクライン社のワクチン部門の責任者として30年を過ごし、トランプ氏がワープ・スピードの指揮官に選んだときにはモデナ社で働いていた男を、アメリカ人が信用しないのは当然だっただろう。当時、トランプはスラウイを「ワクチンの製造、そして実際に処方に関して世界で最も尊敬されている人物の一人」と呼んでいたが、部下のマイケル・ペンス、アレックス・アザール、ブレット・ジロワール提督、ロバート・レッドフィールドが話したことをオウム返しにしただけだった。彼らやその他の人々は、トランプ大統領を欺いてスラウイをOWSの責任者に据えるという大きな陰謀の一部であったと、この情報筋は述べている。スラウイは、モデナのストックオプション1000万ドルを保有し、中国の巨額の投資を受けるブリイ・バイオサイエンスの顧問を務めていることで批判にさらされた。利益相反を避けるため、彼は渋々それらの役職を辞し、当時の保健福祉長官アレックス・アザーと協力し、スラウイを「間違いなく世界で最も経験豊かで成功したワクチン開発者」と賞賛し、ワープスピードを早めるために動き始めた。情報筋によると、スラウイはモデナを辞めたにもかかわらず、2020年12月8日にFDAがモデナの緊急使用認可を与えた後も、5600万ドルを超える報酬を受け取り続けたという。しかし、軍はSlaouiの金銭的動機よりも、Modernaの実験的ワクチンが2020年6月に600人の第2相試験参加者のうち34人を死亡させたという彼の知識により興味を持った。ホワイトハットは、スラウイが、ワクチンが心筋炎や致死的な血栓を引き起こすことを知っていながら、その情報を公にしなかったことを証明する、スラウイが執筆した物理的およびデジタル文書という豊富な証拠を持っていると、我々の情報源は述べています。「私たちはスラウイに関する有罪の証拠の宝箱を手に入れたのです。この男はプランデミックの最大の違反者の一人だった。彼がペンスに書いた手紙を入手した。\"ワクチンが人を殺すことを知っていて、ワープスピード作戦を国民に押し付けたことをトランプのせいにできる \"と。さらに、彼が軍事裁判にかけられ、うまくいけば絞首刑になるであろう、大量の証拠があります。私たちは、彼を逮捕するのに十分すぎるほどの証拠を持っていました」と、この情報筋は語っている。スミス将軍は、ホワイトハット評議会のメンバーであり、アメリカ陸軍特殊作戦司令部の中にあるアメリカ陸軍最高の軽歩兵部隊であり特殊作戦部隊である第75レンジャー連隊の司令官であるJ.D.

Smith将軍の事務所の関係者がReal Raw Newsに語った。<br /><br />スラウイは、プランデミックの間、ほとんどレーダーの下を飛んでいた。メディアは彼の名前をほとんど取り上げず、ファウチ、ビルクス、コリンズといった世間に影響力のある人物や、英語が堪能な公務員の名前を取り上げた。私たちの情報筋によれば、スラウイがメディアから排除されたのは、彼が胡散臭く見え、アメリカ人に信用されないと管理局が考えたからだという。<br /><br />そして、グラクソ・スミスクライン社のワクチン部門の責任者として30年を過ごし、トランプ氏がワープ・スピードの指揮官に選んだときにはモデナ社で働いていた男を、アメリカ人が信用しないのは当然だっただろう。当時、トランプはスラウイを「ワクチンの製造、そして実際に処方に関して世界で最も尊敬されている人物の一人」と呼んでいたが、部下のマイケル・ペンス、アレックス・アザール、ブレット・ジロワール提督、ロバート・レッドフィールドが話したことをオウム返しにしただけだった。彼らやその他の人々は、トランプ大統領を欺いてスラウイをOWSの責任者に据えるという大きな陰謀の一部であったと、この情報筋は述べている。<br /><br />スラウイは、モデナのストックオプション1000万ドルを保有し、中国の巨額の投資を受けるブリイ・バイオサイエンスの顧問を務めていることで批判にさらされた。利益相反を避けるため、彼は渋々それらの役職を辞し、当時の保健福祉長官アレックス・アザーと協力し、スラウイを「間違いなく世界で最も経験豊かで成功したワクチン開発者」と賞賛し、ワープスピードを早めるために動き始めた。<br /><br />情報筋によると、スラウイはモデナを辞めたにもかかわらず、2020年12月8日にFDAがモデナの緊急使用認可を与えた後も、5600万ドルを超える報酬を受け取り続けたという。<br /><br />しかし、軍はSlaouiの金銭的動機よりも、Modernaの実験的ワクチンが2020年6月に600人の第2相試験参加者のうち34人を死亡させたという彼の知識により興味を持った。ホワイトハットは、スラウイが、ワクチンが心筋炎や致死的な血栓を引き起こすことを知っていながら、その情報を公にしなかったことを証明する、スラウイが執筆した物理的およびデジタル文書という豊富な証拠を持っていると、我々の情報源は述べています。<br /><br />「私たちはスラウイに関する有罪の証拠の宝箱を手に入れたのです。この男はプランデミックの最大の違反者の一人だった。彼がペンスに書いた手紙を入手した。\"ワクチンが人を殺すことを知っていて、ワープスピード作戦を国民に押し付けたことをトランプのせいにできる \"と。さらに、彼が軍事裁判にかけられ、うまくいけば絞首刑になるであろう、大量の証拠があります。私たちは、彼を逮捕するのに十分すぎるほどの証拠を持っていました」と、この情報筋は語っている。<br /><br />スミス将軍は、ホワイトハット評議会のメンバーであり、アメリカ陸軍特殊作戦司令部の中にあるアメリカ陸軍最高の軽歩兵部隊であり特殊作戦部隊である第75レンジャー連隊の司令官であるJ.D. Keirsey大佐と話した後に、この逮捕に至ったと彼は付け加えた。<br /><br />土曜日の朝、レンジャーたちはノースカロライナ州ゼブロンにある7,500平方フィートのスラウイの家のドアをぶち壊した。彼の3人の息子の1人、フセイン・モハマド・アブドゥル・スラウイはその場にいて、レンジャーズにピストルを突きつけた。彼は射殺され、レンジャーはスラウイを拘束した。彼は、レンジャーズが彼を民間車両に押し込むと、「sayantaqim li allah」（アラーは私に復讐する）、と叫びました。<br /><br />\"我々は彼を捕まえた。私たちはこの野郎を捕まえた」と情報筋は言った。\"彼は多くの中の一人に過ぎない。しかし、我々は彼らを削り取っている\"<br /><br />余談だが、スラウイは2021年3月、グラクソ・スミスクラインの子会社であるガルバニ・バイオエレクトロニクスの取締役会長から、複数の若い男性社員からセクハラで訴えられ、解雇されている。",
