Adams said, “We all know there are too many guns…”. Wrong, as this is the typical leftist rant.  There are too many criminals and not enough guns in the hands of law abiding citizens.  If you have or use a gun in the commission of any crime, add a gun use enhancement charge.  BTW, the penalty for a gun use enhancement should be death.  If you’re using a gun, it’s only fair that you set the value of your life and thus should lose it.  Consider it restitution.",

Parasites are present in mosquitos, ticks etc. What is Bill Gates adding to Mosquitos & ticks? What is being sprayed out of airplane by Bill Gates? One intentional death is still murder. The US is not independent, IT IS UNDER INVASION. Chinese Fentanyl & Heroin is coming in w/ mostly military age men, staging for attacks all over the US. China & the US are at war. There is a blockade & everything is being shut off. We are under siege. The Bidens, Clintons, Obamas ... “Elected” members of the B.A.R. have been taking billions from from the Central Bankers & China to do all this. Our US Tax Dollars are offshored, & part ends up in the Perp’s pockets, not ours. The biggest heist & mass murder is now being pulled off. It is all because you have NO PRIVACY. Billionaires like Fink, Bezos, Gates, Soros, Schwab can mine your data to figure out how best to divide & conquer us. We the People need to re-instate the US Constitution, then set up our own Constitutional Peoples Grand Jury System & get to prosecuting the perps ... EXECUTIONS PAY-PER-VIEW ... Do you agree? @SvenVonErick Ivermectin kills the parasites transmitted by bugs & “vaccine” needles. Many parasites aren’t detectable, & are too small to be notices. They can number in the bodies by the trillions. Do you lack the mental, physical & other capacities just to resist all the BS we are being put through? We need to just nail each perp with just one of their murders to put them away. What is Hillary Clinton’s body count? What are Barack Obama & Eric Holder’s body count with the “Fast & Furious” gun running program. That pair are out to Suspend the US Constitution. Did they succeed, or should they be prosecuted for murder?Come on people ... We have a job to do ... They will not stop until they are made to stop.

Parasites are present in mosquitos, ticks etc. What is Bill Gates adding to Mosquitos &amp; ticks? What is being sprayed out of airplane by Bill Gates? One intentional death is still murder. The US is not independent, IT IS UNDER INVASION. Chinese Fentanyl &amp; Heroin is coming in w/ mostly military age men, staging for attacks all over the US. China &amp; the US are at war. There is a blockade &amp; everything is being shut off. We are under siege. The Bidens, Clintons, Obamas ... “Elected” members of the B.A.R. have been taking billions from from the Central Bankers &amp; China to do all this. Our US Tax Dollars are offshored, &amp; part ends up in the Perp’s pockets, not ours. The biggest heist &amp; mass murder is now being pulled off. It is all because you have NO PRIVACY. Billionaires like Fink, Bezos, Gates, Soros, Schwab can mine your data to figure out how best to divide &amp; conquer us. We the People need to re-instate the US Constitution, then set up our own Constitutional Peoples Grand Jury System &amp; get to prosecuting the perps ... EXECUTIONS PAY-PER-VIEW ...

Many parasites aren’t detectable, &amp; are too small to be notices. They can number in the bodies by the trillions.

With Covid, January 6th, ‘Transitory’ Inflation, and of course Hunter’s Laptop—and you will find absolutely hysterical narrative pushing up front followed by retractions, corrections, and outright denials as reality became undeniable. In the meanwhile, our civilization was ripped apart, our citizens were gaslit and impoverished, and in countries across the Western world, innocent people were removed from polite society, branded as lepers, and fired from their jobs. Why? Because there is one story that just won’t die and for which no corrections have been issued—the shibboleth that vaccination can prevent infection, transmission, and help “end” COVID.While there is never an excuse for hateful rhetoric towards, and intervention in, the personal medical choices of law-abiding Americans, perhaps one could have, kinda sorta, understood the campaign if the new vaccines had provided long-lasting immunity and prevented community transmission. They do not. Early on we were told: “Nine out of ten [vaccinated] people won’t get sick” (Columbia University feat. Run-DMC, February 12th, 2021, no this is not a joke); “Vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don`t get sick” (Dr. Rochelle Walensky, March 29th, 2021); “When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected” (Dr. Anthony Fauci, May 17th, 2021). And by mid-summer, 2021, we were still being told that unequivocally, these vaccines were a resounding success worthy of uncritical support. On July 27th in Scientific American, Dr. Eric Topol wrote, “Vaccination is the closest thing to a sure thing we have in this pandemic.” Not to be outdone, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the NIAID told CBS on August 1st, that the unvaccinated were responsible for “propagating this outbreak.” But on July 29th, 2021, the Washington Post reported a scoop that the CDC was privately acknowledging that the vaccinated could spread COVID as easily as the unvaccinated. Occasionally, they are forced to report inconvenient facts. And August 5th, CDC Director Walensky told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that, “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death — they prevent it. But what they can’t do anymore is prevent transmission.”While there is a mountain of medical literature available demonstrating quite clearly the failure of these vaccines to prevent infection and transmission, the August 5th declaration from the CDC Director should have made clear that being vaccinated is contributing in no way to the safety of others, nor to the eradication of this virus.

With Covid, January 6th, ‘Transitory’ Inflation, and of course Hunter’s Laptop—and you will find absolutely hysterical narrative pushing up front followed by retractions, corrections, and outright denials as reality became undeniable. In the meanwhile, our civilization was ripped apart, our citizens were gaslit and impoverished, and in countries across the Western world, innocent people were removed from polite society, branded as lepers, and fired from their jobs. Why? Because there is one story that just won’t die and for which no corrections have been issued—the shibboleth that vaccination can prevent infection, transmission, and help “end” COVID.While there is never an excuse for hateful rhetoric towards, and intervention in, the personal medical choices of law-abiding Americans, perhaps one could have, kinda sorta, understood the campaign if the new vaccines had provided long-lasting immunity and prevented community transmission. They do not. Early on we were told: “Nine out of ten [vaccinated] people won’t get sick” (Columbia University feat. Run-DMC, February 12th, 2021, no this is not a joke); “Vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don`t get sick” (Dr. Rochelle Walensky, March 29th, 2021); “When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected” (Dr. Anthony Fauci, May 17th, 2021). And by mid-summer, 2021, we were still being told that unequivocally, these vaccines were a resounding success worthy of uncritical support. On July 27th in Scientific American, Dr. Eric Topol wrote, “Vaccination is the closest thing to a sure thing we have in this pandemic.” Not to be outdone, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the NIAID told CBS on August 1st, that the unvaccinated were responsible for “propagating this outbreak.” But on July 29th, 2021, the Washington Post reported a scoop that the CDC was privately acknowledging that the vaccinated could spread COVID as easily as the unvaccinated. Occasionally, they are forced to report inconvenient facts. And August 5th, CDC Director Walensky told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that, “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death — they prevent it. But what they can’t do anymore is prevent transmission.”While there is a mountain of medical literature available demonstrating quite clearly the failure of these vaccines to prevent infection and transmission, the August 5th declaration from the CDC Director should have made clear that being vaccinated is contributing in no way to the safety of others, nor to the eradication of this virus.
