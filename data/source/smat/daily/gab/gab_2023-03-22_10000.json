The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

I was at the game here so let&#39;s get to the scoring palooza.Ovechkin opened the scoring (because of course he did.) Then Capitals winger T.J. Oshie deflected home the second marker of the game. Washington forward Conor Sheary potted the Caps’ third in the opening period. Finally, Blue Jacket Eric Robinson got one back for Columbus.In the second period, Adam Boqvist sniped the Blue Jackets to a one-goal deficit. Then Capitals center Sonny Milano burned his former team to put the Caps back up by two. Columbus&#39; Jack Roslovic responded for the Blooj with a lamp lighter and then Washington&#39;s defenseman Nick Jensen scored to wrap up the stanza.In the third period, Boqvist got his second of the night with another bullet. Then Blue Jacket Emil Bemstrom tied it all up. Jensen followed with a sweet backhand to restore the lead. But Columbus&#39; Captain Boone Jenner tied it up with his goalie, Daniil Tarasov, pulled. So it was onto overtime.In overtime, Blue Jackets Roslovic won it.What an absolutely awesome pregame ceremony. The Caps know how to do these milestone recognitions well. And so does Ovechkin. He opened the scoring, by accident, but that’s just what a good goal scorer does.

That second “crime” is expected to be a federal campaign finance violation.McCarthy called that expected attempt to upgrade a misdemeanor to a felony “specious.”He said when New York penal law refers to “another crime,” it obviously means another New York crime, while the campaign finance violation would be a federal crime. “New York has election finance laws, too, and it has been suggested that Bragg may rely on them to try to prove the felony. But those laws apply to statewide offices, not the presidency,” McCarthy wrote.Furthermore, McCarthy said it is “highly unlikely that Trump violated federal campaign finance law, and that even if he had, such violations – which have involved significantly higher money amounts – are typically settled by fines paid to the Federal Election Commission, not by criminal prosecution.McCarthy noted that in New York, campaign finance violations are routinely disposed of by the imposition of fines. He pointed out that New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, is currently facing likely fines for “accepting illegal campaign contributions, improperly accounting for them, and then contemptuously ignoring requests for documentation by state election authorities.”He noted that former NYC mayors Bill DeBlasio and Mike Bloomberg also ran into trouble with state election officials, with DeBlasio fined and Bloomberg cited for violating “the spirit” of the laws in connection with a dubious $1.2 million contribution. There were no criminal prosecutions, McCarthy said.As former U.S. Attorney Brett Tolman recently pointed out, the FEC merely fined Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee for mischaracterizing payments to an opposition research firm for the infamous pee-dossier on Trump as legal expenses — which is essentially what Bragg would be arguing Trump did in mischaracterizing alleged hush-money payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels as legal expenses.McCarthy also wrote that in order to upgrade the misdemeanor to a felony, Bragg would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records but did it because he knew he had committed the second “crime” of campaign finance violation.“Given that lawyers are having a hard time even hypothesizing what this other crime may be, it is hard to imagine that Trump, a non-lawyer, knew about it,” McCarthy wrote.And Trump could argue, McCarthy said, that he falsified business records because he wanted to hide the alleged hush-money from his wife and voters, not because he was trying to cover a campaign finance violation.McCarthy said if Bragg cannot successfully argue that the misdemeanor should be upgraded to a felony, the case should be dismissed as time-barred.",

Check Dis Out.Then-Vice President Joe Biden approved an official statement in December 2015 about Hunter Biden’s position on a Ukrainian energy company’s board despite claims he was not involved with the family’s business, emails obtained from the National Archives show.Since assuming office, at least seven times Joe Biden or his communications team have outright denied, and deflected questions about, involvement in the Biden family enterprise.Biden “acted at all times in a manner consistent with well-established executive branch ethics standards,” Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the president’s campaign, said in 2019. “He carried out the Obama-Biden administration’s policies without regard to any interests other than the public’s and neither discussed this with his son nor was involved in any way with his son’s private business pursuits.”But those denials have been proven false again by a new trove of emails uncovered from the National Archives by America First Legal. The new trove of emails unearthed by a lawsuit against the Archives shows Biden and Hunter coordinated through their respective associates in response to questions from reporters about if Hunter’s position on Burisma’s board undermined then-Vice President Biden’s credibility in pushing anti-corruption measures.In April 2014, Hunter joined the board of Burisma, just two years before Joe Biden stated he forced the firing of Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. Despite Hunter’s lack of experience in Ukraine or the energy sector, he was paid $83,000 per month by the energy company, or $1 million per year — just weeks after his father was announced “point person” on U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.Emails previously released from the Archives show Hunter advised the Office of Vice President Biden in 2014 on how to handle media inquiries regarding his position on the board of Burisma, a potential violation of federal law due to Hunter failing to register as a foreign agent.That trend appears to have continued well into 2015 when Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s former communications director, told Hunter’s top financial lieutenant Eric Schwerin via email that Joe Biden approved a statement regarding Hunter’s board position.Notably, Bedingfield departed the White House in 2023 just as the House Oversight Committee probe into Joe Biden heated up.“VP signed off on this — will give this quote to reporters in my name shortly,” she said, including the quote below in the email:“Hunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer. The Vice President does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company. The Vice President has pushed aggressively for years — both publicly with groups like the US-Ukraine Business Forum and privately in meetings in with [sic] Ukrainian leaders — for Ukraine to make every effort to investigate and prosecute corruption in accordance with the rule of law. It will once again be a key focus during his trip this week.”America First Legal President Stephen Miller stated the emails are a bombshell that shows Hunter and Joe Biden often coordinated about the family’s business dealings. They are “explosive revelations” that “conclusively demonstrate that there is no daylight between Hunter and Joe Biden on Ukraine,” he said in a statement.“Taken together with the Oversight Committee’s revelations about the Biden Family finances, it is now indisputable that there is a need for a full criminal investigation into the Bidens’ foreign influence peddling and exotic foreign financial payoffs,” Miller said.On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee revealed a Biden family business associate received a $3 million wire transfer from a Chinese energy company and subsequent payments after Joe Biden left the vice presidency in 2017. In turn, the family business associate sent $1.3 million to Hunter, James, Hallie, and an unknown “Biden.”Joe Biden denied the payout on Friday when questioned about recent revelations the family received funds from China.Can you say Influence Peddling, Pay to Play Scams, Money Laundering, Tax Evasion etc.Say it ain't So...........\"Quid Pro Joe\"",

Bragg is a \"progressive\" (i.e., advocate for criminals) DA who is funded by George Soros.In June, Bragg was linked to Soros after it was revealed that the far-left Color of Change PAC which endorsed his candidacy was receiving millions from the billionaire investor. “Soros also donated $1 million to Alvin Bragg’s successful DA campaign in Manhattan, funneling the cash through the Color of Change political action committee, according to public filings,” the New York Post reported.In the year following his election crime skyrocketedThe latest NYPD figures show major crime remains up 36% so far this year – even though shootings and murders both saw a dip of about 10% as of Sunday. “The politicians will say ‘Murder is down!’ and ignore everything else,” said Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. “Meanwhile, everything else is God awful.”Grand larceny was up a whopping 48.3%, from 20,374 to 30,205 incidents, auto theft rose 42%, from 5,589 to 7,939, and robbery jumped 39.8%, from 7,366 to 10,294, over the same period in 2021, the data show. Rapes increased 10%, from 892 to 989, and felonious assaults were up 19.5%, from 13,086 to 15,640, the statistics show.Bragg ran on a promise to pretty much not prosecute crime. He has downgraded 52% of felonies to misdemeanors. His soft touch on crime has come with a terrible cost. A 25 year old man who raped a teenager in New York City saw his rape charge reduced to \"sexual coercion\" by Bragg.But just a week before he was set to be sentenced Wednesday, Washington allegedly went on a sex-crime spree, attacking four women and a man near the homeless shelter where he was living in the Bronx.Josa Alba, a bodega owner in the city, killed a man attacking him in self defense.  Bragg had him charged with murder and stuffed the Latino Alba in Rikers.Alba called police, and when they arrived, they arrested him on second-degree murder charges, sparking a wave of protest from supporters, including Mayor Eric Adams and former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, who said the stabbing was committed in self-defense.He drops a lot of casesHis office won felony convictions at a rate of 51%, down from 68% in 2019. His misdemeanor conviction rate was 29%, compared to 53% in 2019.Bragg declined to prosecute 1,119 felony cases during his first 11 months in office compared to 828 declined in 2019 by his predecessor,  a 35% increase.That all makes it appear he's being successful at combating crime.Bragg has been rather selective with who gets charged with what. He routinely downgrades felonies to misdemeanors but in Trump's case he's trying to upgrade a misdemeanor to a felony. That reeks of politics.Bragg's judgment has been called into question.

Everything about their policies is about open borders, importing more Hispanics, more Muslims, creating sanctuary cities for THuGs, raising their kids from cradle to grave in &quot;It Takes a Village&quot;.<br />Taking away our cars to force us into apartment buildings to live next to the illiterate mothers of fatherless children.<br />Climate Change has morphed into Covid and election mandates.<br />It is social engineering and is Sustainable Living, Agenda 21.<br />The THuG Life, they teach us in our schools excuses violence and drugs because there are no jobs in their neighborhoods, so they want to live in ours, call us White Supremacists, kill capitalism because it creates inequity, and destroy our schools because they can&#39;t pass math and reading skills. <\/p><p>In the Trump administration Ben Carson saw government housing as a stepping stone. A temporary place for people to work towards creating a living wage trade.<\/p><p>President Trump created 8,700 Opportunity Zones, largely in low-income minority neighborhoods. Incentives have attracted some $75 billion in private investment to these communities.<\/p><p>Biden&#39;s THuGs burned them down.<\/p><p>Browsing through this list will expose them and enlighten you as to how pervasive anti-Americans are.<\/p>",
