Unlike Iraq, the nuclear weapons are not the imagined fantasies of war profiteers...The arsenals are real.. Continued escalation is toying with nuclear fire which could set the world ablaze... Nothing else good can be had from this war..peace talks should be taking place...America's strategic position in the world is weakened as China and Russia have formed an alliance against us.. our fair weather friends in Saudi Arabia entertain breaking the petro dollar, threatening the US dollar status as the global reserve currency...It turns out that after decades of invading foreign countries in the middle east few nations outside Europe recognize America's moral authority on the question of invading foreign countries..If this resolution was truly in the interest of peace.. It would not call for continued condition less spending and racking up trillions of dollars more in debt on the American people in order to draw out a war that endangers the whole world..Resolve this border dispute, broker a peace, end the war, end the famine, end the energy crisis and take the real threat of nuclear annihilation off the table.\"",

She had attended the school years earlier and knew her way around.

The ultimate crime is not asking the question, why?Eric Metaxas comes close to the answer, and it has to do with the Presbyterian Church of America, with which The Covenant School is associated, along with many other major so-called Christian denominations. Wrote Metaxas in his ‚ÄúLetter to the American Church‚Äù:The ideas and forces we face have an atheistic Marxist ideology in common.‚Ä¶ [They] share a bitter taproot that leads all the way down to Hell.Critical Race Theory ‚Äî which is atheistic and Marxist ‚Äî and radical transgender and pro-abortion ideologies are all inescapably anti-God and anti-human.They are decidedly at war with the ideas of family and marriage, and with the idea of America as a force for good‚Ä¶.These ideas have over many decades infiltrated our own culture in such a way that they touch everything.Where is the church? Where are the pastors loudly declaiming against this infiltration? For the most part they are silent, as is the kept media.Put simply, what would one expect from a generation that has been brainwashed into thinking that there is no God, that life is meaningless and purposeless, that humans evolved from slime and mud. Why wouldn‚Äôt they shoot each other? There‚Äôs no conscience, no morality, no right and wrong. In today‚Äôs culture, even to ask about morality and conscience is to be labeled a fanatic, or worse.That‚Äôs why the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù is never raised. It‚Äôs much easier for those behind the destructive ideologies being taught in schools to blame guns and gun owners. It avoids the real question.https://thenewamerican.com/media-covered-everything-about-nashville-shooting-except-the-cause/",

Wrote Metaxas in his ‚ÄúLetter to the American Church‚Äù:<\/p><p><em>The ideas and forces we face have an atheistic Marxist ideology in common.‚Ä¶ [They] share a bitter taproot that leads all the way down to Hell.<\/em><\/p><p><em>Critical Race Theory ‚Äî which is atheistic and Marxist ‚Äî and radical transgender and pro-abortion ideologies are all inescapably anti-God and anti-human.<\/em><\/p><p><em>They are decidedly at war with the ideas of family and marriage, and with the idea of America as a force for good‚Ä¶.<\/em><\/p><p><em>These ideas have over many decades infiltrated our own culture in such a way that they touch everything.<\/em><\/p><p>Where is the church? Where are the pastors loudly declaiming against this infiltration? For the most part they are silent, as is the kept media.<\/p><p>Put simply, what would one expect from a generation that has been brainwashed into thinking that there is no God, that life is meaningless and purposeless, that humans evolved from slime and mud. Why wouldn‚Äôt they shoot each other? There‚Äôs no conscience, no morality, no right and wrong. In today‚Äôs culture, even to ask about morality and conscience is to be labeled a fanatic, or worse.<\/p><p>That‚Äôs why the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù is never raised. It‚Äôs much easier for those behind the destructive ideologies being taught in schools to blame guns and gun owners. It avoids the real question.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://thenewamerican.com/media-covered-everything-about-nashville-shooting-except-the-cause/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>thenewamerican.com/media-covered-everything-a<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">bout-nashville-shooting-except-the-cause/<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><\/p>",

Lordan ...Think of the very beginning of the Psalms 1: ‚ÄúBlessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.‚Äù At least a faint sense of this may still be preserved even in our secular society when its members refer to ‚Äúthe law,‚Äù though without being able to penetrate to the heart of the mystery they have thereby invoked.Various cognate terms have been used from time immemorial to express essentially what is meant by ‚Äúthe law‚Äù.... They include such terms as ‚Äúthe natural law‚Äù or ‚Äúthe higher law,‚Äù which suggest the relationship of law to its ultimate origin in the divine. C. S. Lewis used the ancient Chinese term the Tao, ‚Äúfor brevity,‚Äù to refer to a\"conception  in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, [have in common] something we cannot neglect. It is the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are.  . .  . [It] is not one among a series of possible systems of value. It is the sole source of all value judgements. If it is rejected, all value is rejected. If any value is retained, it is retained.It is only in the last couple of hundred years or so that legal philosophy has called the existence of ‚Äúthe law‚Äù into serious doubt, and this has occurred, not coincidentally, concurrently with modernity‚Äôs doubts about the existence of God....... Even those who toil in the fields of law, judges and lawyers, refer not just to ‚Äúlaws‚Äù or ‚Äúa law,‚Äù but to ‚Äúthe law‚Äù as if it is something really existent, something objective, something in some sense ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù individual positive laws, something they cannot create but which they must strive to discover as a norm...In the practice of law, how often we hear disappointed lawyers and the litigants they represent bemoan the fact that a judge got ‚Äúthe law‚Äù completely wrong in their case. Of such disappointments appeals are made...And in speaking of appeals to higher courts, the mystery grows. A court of appeals will often reverse the trial court, finding that the lower court got ‚Äúthe law‚Äù wrong, while a supreme court may then reverse the court of appeals for the same reason. Different judges on these higher courts may disagree among themselves in the same case. Dissents are common.Even the U.S. Supreme Court may find that it got ‚Äúthe law‚Äù wrong years after it rendered a decision purporting to tell us what ‚Äúthe law‚Äù was. Think of Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision in which the Court required the racial integration of public schools, thereby overruling its 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which had found separate public facilities for whites and blacks to be ‚Äúequal.‚Äù Or think of Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization, the relatively recent case in which the Court overruled its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade and its 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey regarding abortion. Can these reversals be attributed merely to different interpretations of our positive, written laws, or is there something else at play, some force called ‚Äúthe law‚Äù which somehow compels jurists to reevaluate their work?By ‚Äúthe law‚Äù we appear to mean something normative. The term seems to be a shorthand way of introducing a moral sense into law. ‚ÄúThe law‚Äù suggests what the laws ought to be. It provides a standard or measure for laws. It is aspirational. While there is a distinction to be drawn between law and morals, a society generally strives to embody its sense of right and wrong in its positive laws, the laws that get written down, but it never fully succeeds in doing so, because no human work is perfect. There is a tension, which may rise to the level of personal or social consciousness, between ‚Äúthe law‚Äù and at least certain positive laws, between the ‚Äúlaw‚Äù that is and ‚Äúthe law‚Äù that ought to be.The effort to conform positive laws to ‚Äúthe law‚Äù is fundamental for the sake not only of genuine political order but also of personal order, because the positive laws of any society are among its greatest moral teachers. Think of what America was taught about the dignity of all Americans by Plessy v. Ferguson, or about the value of all human life by Roe and Casey. A society that refuses to see any relationship between law and morality becomes decadent. ‚ÄúThe understanding of just order,‚Äù said the German-American political philosopher Eric Voegelin, ‚Äúprogresses concretely through the reaction of a soul sensitive to the transcendent source of order against injustice in the environment.‚Äùhttps://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=36-02-031-f&amp;readcode=10906How GOP justices CFR mbr  O‚ÄôConnor, Kennedy, &amp; Souter used their positions to help divide and conquer the bewildered herdhttps://tinyurl.com/2p99bzvm",
