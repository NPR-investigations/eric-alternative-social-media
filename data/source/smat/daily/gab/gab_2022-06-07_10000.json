Ball faces more charges, according to authorities.“The FBI conducted a several months-long investigation into child pornography, which revealed information linking Eric Ball to media of children under the age of 13, involved in sexual acts,” the Sheriff’s Office said Thursday. “Terrebonne Parish SVU detectives assisted with the search warrant at a local Houma residence, where Ball was located and taken into custody. The FBI and Terrebonne SVU detectives are in the process of reviewing evidence seized during the search of the home and believe that additional charges are likely.”Ball had worked as a substitute teacher at a nearby Houma school and had previously worked as a teacher in Terrebonne, according to officials.According to school Superintendent Philip Martin, Ball most recently worked as a substitute teacher on a day-to-day basis.“He was not considered an employee,” Martin said. “His current status is that he’s not employed and his past status is that he worked as a day-to-day substitute.”",

Mitchell is the founder of an organization, ‘Man Up!’ that was formed to stop shootings in urban communities. He founded the group after serving a prison sentence for first-degree manslaughter in 1992.“This is the civil rights battle of our lifetime, dealing with how guns are destroying not only individuals, but is destroying the anatomy of our cities and our communities,” said Mr. Adams at a rally with Mitchell outside City Hall on Thursday. Asked about his appointee, he said Mitchell had been a friend of 30 years, and he “didn’t have to find people; I have relationships with people.” Adams added, “We respect each other’s expertise.”Mitchell’s organization has been controversial for its past actions and statements. One of the main protest tactics used by the group — i.e., ‘disruption’ — where teams of activists swarm neighborhoods with high shooting rates to position themselves between shooters and victims. This method — termed by Mitchell as ‘Cure Violence’ or “precision prevention” — has attracted criticism for endangering activists by placing them in the line of fire.",

My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this.

Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how.

Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n6.

A minority cannot be called a minority unless they are pretty much powerless.  What we call minorities in the US are NOT powerless people.  This begs the question: Does Holder acknowledge that conservatives, and if you want to racialize it - \"Whites\" - are a minority, a group targeted for prejudice, discrimination, and unequal treatment or is he just misusing the term for political purposes?  More accurately, a coalition of people from various groups regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation are the nationalist majority exercising majority power to set things right.  In the end, the majority power coalition has drawn a Durkheimian line in the sand.  Some entitled culturally spoiled agitators, including the vastly numerically inferior - the minority-minority's behavior - will be constrained by the majority.  This will not be the separation of races but the separation of socially and publicly good behavior from anti-social and publicly bad behavior.

Estamos falando, é claro, da reunião anual e sempre super secreta dos membros do Grupo Bilderberg.A 68ª Reunião Bilderberg já aconteceu em Washington, DC, que começou na quinta-feira e foi até o domingo. O CEO da Pfizer, Albert Bourla, o ex-CEO do Google Eric Schmidt, Henry Kissinger e o diretor da CIA William J. Burns estão entre os 120 convidados ( clique aqui para ver a lista completa ) deste ano de 21 países… embora não muitos russos.O Grupo Bilderberg se orgulha de fazer cumprir a Chatham House Rule,  segundo a qual os participantes são livres para usar todas as informações preciosas que desejarem, porque aqueles que participam dessas reuniões são obrigados a não divulgar a fonte de qualquer informação sensível ou o que exatamente foi dito. Isso ajuda a garantir o lendário sigilo dos membros e da real agenda do Grupo Bilderberg – o que é motivo de inúmeras teorias da conspiração. Mas, como observa Pepe Escobar, isso não significa que o estranho segredo não possa ser revelado.+++https://rayviolet2.blogspot.com/2022/06/agenda-2022-do-grupo-bilderberg.html",

Estamos falando, é claro, da reunião anual e sempre super secreta dos membros do Grupo Bilderberg.<br /><br />A 68ª Reunião Bilderberg já aconteceu em Washington, DC, que começou na quinta-feira e foi até o domingo. <br /><br />O CEO da Pfizer, Albert Bourla, o ex-CEO do Google Eric Schmidt, Henry Kissinger e o diretor da CIA William J. Burns estão entre os 120 convidados ( clique aqui para ver a lista completa ) deste ano de 21 países… embora não muitos russos.<br /><br />O Grupo Bilderberg se orgulha de fazer cumprir a Chatham House Rule,  segundo a qual os participantes são livres para usar todas as informações preciosas que desejarem, porque aqueles que participam dessas reuniões são obrigados a não divulgar a fonte de qualquer informação sensível ou o que exatamente foi dito. <br /><br />Isso ajuda a garantir o lendário sigilo dos membros e da real agenda do Grupo Bilderberg – o que é motivo de inúmeras teorias da conspiração.

In response to a comment made by WEF panelist, Lea Wermelin, on the responsibility of governments to make structural changes in our economy to combat climate change, Gore replied, “I have good news on this front.  We are about to enter an age of radical transparency.  I have been among those who have formed a new coalition called ‘Climate TRACE’…Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions.  It’s a coalition of artificial intelligence technology companies, NGOs, and universities, using data from 300 existing satellites from multiple countries, ground, sea and air-based censors, and internet data streams, to use machine-learning to create algorithms for every single sub-sector of the economy.” This colossal data-collection project aims to replace the current self-reporting system of greenhouse gas emissions by countries and companies, who have committed to net zero goals, by publishing reports of climate offenders so that countries, companies, and even individuals can be “held accountable.”  The Google-backed AI algorithm used by Climate TRACE appears to lay the framework for enforcing ESG initiatives heavily pushed by financial behemoths such as BlackRock, as well as a technocratic social and climate credit system.A Framework for ESG InitiativesBlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, has made no attempts to hide his plans to demolish the current economy through environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.  In his 2021 letter to CEOs, Fink remarked, “It’s important to recognize that net zero demands a transformation of the entire economy.” Since Larry Fink issued a letter to CEOs in 2020, which focused on BlackRock’s shift from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism, by assessing companies based on ESG initiatives, corporations have been falling in line with Blackrock’s ‘woke’ climate agenda.  However, Al Gore warned his fellow climate activists at the WEF 2022 Annual Meeting that, “greenwashing,” or the act of falsely claiming to be environmentally sustainable, “is a major obstacle to solving the climate crisis.  It is made up of falsehoods, clever PR, and it has to stop.” Of course, Gore presents his Climate TRACE framework as the perfect solution and has stated that investors (such as BlackRock), could potentially use this technocratic system to hold corporations responsible for falling in line with their ESG standards.
