Despite being sold as voter roll help, Soros funded ERIC appears to be a data gathering program who takes that info and gives it to liberal left leaning groups.\nWhere counties used to take care of their own rolls, ERIC has taken over. It appears we are going to one Federal voting roll data base controlled by unknown users. \nStates need to withdraw from ERIC. Voters need to vote in person.\nFlorida Voice News reporter, Eric Daugherty:\nVoting in Multiple States\nOn November 4, 2022 a woman was arrested by Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Election Crime Unit.

Alabama joined ERIC in 2015 and currently pays about $25,000 a year for its membership.However, member states may not realize ERIC was started by far-left political activist David Becker, who has dedicated his life to attacking conservatives and advancing left-wing policies.

ERIC shares voter roll data – including records of unregistered citizens – with CEIR, which then reportedly creates targeted mailing lists for unregistered but likely Democrat voters and sends them back to the states for voter registration outreach.Additionally, per government watchdog Verity Vote, ERIC doesn’t actually clean states’ voter rolls, but rather inflates them.

A March 2022 audit by Michigan’s auditor general found the state’s Bureau of Elections failed to sufficiently clean its voter rolls, though Michigan had joined ERIC in 2019.

Instead of relying on ERIC to clean Alabama’s voter rolls, Allen plans on using change-of-address information from the United States Postal Service, driver’s license records from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, and death records from the Alabama Department of Public Health to maintain accurate rolls.Alabama is the second ERIC member state to withdraw from the pact.

We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

            "description": "Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. Results We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. Conclusion Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.",

As I argued at the time, there is an enormous amount of strong circumstantial evidence suggesting that this referred to a “sensitive collection program” involving cell phone location tracking—potentially on a mass scale—using Patriot’s “Section 215″ or “business records” authority.Lest anyone think they’d let the issue drop, Wyden and Udall last week released a sharply-worded letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, blasting the Justice Department for misleading the public about the scope of the government’s surveillance authority. The real audience for an open letter of this sort, of course, is not the nominal recipient, but rather the press and the public. Beyond simply reminding us that the issue exists, the letter confirms for the first time that the “secret law” of which the senators had complained does indeed involve Section 215. But there are some additional intriguing morsels for the attentive surveillance wonk.The letter focuses particularly on “highly misleading” statements by Justice Department officials analogizing Section 215 powers to grand jury subpoenas. “As you know,” Wyden and Udall write, “Section 215 authorities are not interpreted in the same way that grand jury subpoena authorities are, and we are concerned that when Justice Department officials suggest that the two authorities are ‘analogous’ they provide the public with a false understanding of how surveillance law is interpreted in practice.”",

Adam Schiff’s days as chair of the House Intelligence Committee are numbered.After a four-year reign, California Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff’s days as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, marked by abuse and grotesque politicization, are finally numbered. But it’s not just Schiff’s chairmanship headed out the door with the incoming Republican majority; it’s his seat on the committee altogether.On Sunday, GOP House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy made clear a trio of liberal lawmakers were on the chopping block for their assignments after the chamber took the unprecedented step of dictating minority committee appointments under Democrat rule. Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was kicked off of her committees just a month after her congressional inauguration.“Should you become speaker of the House in January, what are you going to do in terms of these Democrats that you have on such important committees?” asked Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. “You’ve talked in the past about removing Ilhan Omar, you’ve talked about removing Adam Schiff, about Eric Swalwell. Will you deliver?”In January, McCarthy told Breitbart News each would be removed from their respective positions on the Intelligence Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee if he were elected speaker with a Republican majority.“I’ll keep that promise,” McCarthy told Bartiromo. McCarthy had already been calling for Swalwell’s resignation from the House Intelligence Committee since details surfaced of the Democrat’s close relationship with a since-vanished Chinese spy.“Eric Swalwell cannot get a security clearance in the public sector,” McCarthy said Sunday. “Why would we ever give him a security clearance and the secrets to America?”“Adam Schiff, who had lied to the American public time and again, we will not allow him to be on the Intel Committee either,” McCarthy added.Schiff’s Rise from RussiaSchiff was appointed ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee six months before Donald Trump descended on the golden escalator in 2015. By the time Trump captured the White House, Schiff had become the Democrats’ point man on their prime conspiracy to take down the president and undermine democracy in the form of the Russia hoax. In fact, Schiff was the original Russia hoaxer who claimed repeatedly for years to have evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.Schiff used his perch on the Intelligence Committee to foment fear that the new Republican president was in fact a Russian agent who colluded with the Kremlin for command of the Oval Office. He did so through leaks and testimony to the media which published claims unchecked, making Schiff’s office an apparent ground zero for the false and damaging narrative of Russian collusion.In March 2017, Schiff said on MSNBC “there is more than circumstantial evidence” that Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russian government. Two months later, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel investigation to probe whether Trump was indeed guilty of collusion. The two-year investigation run with unlimited resources would eventually come up short of finding one person on the Trump campaign, let alone Trump himself, that colluded with the Kremlin. Schiff responded to Trump’s exoneration by castigating House Republicans and foreshadowing more to emerge that would implicate Trump in an apparent crime.“In the coming weeks and months, new information will continue to be exposed through enterprising journalism, indictments by the Special Counsel, or continued investigative work by Committee Democrats and our counterparts in the Senate,” Schiff said in a press release. “And each time this new information becomes public, Republicans will be held accountable for abandoning a critical investigation of such vital national importance.”Schiff was right on the money when he claimed more would emerge surrounding the politicized investigations of President Trump, but it’s not Republicans who would end up requiring accountability.Subsequent revelations from courtrooms, The Federalist’s reporting, and the DOJ inspector general would find gross misconduct by the FBI as deep state actors themselves worked in cahoots with Russian operatives to undermine a presidential administration. The FBI even paid for Russian disinformation to frame President Trump.",

Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was kicked off of her committees just a month after her congressional inauguration.<br /><br />“Should you become speaker of the House in January, what are you going to do in terms of these Democrats that you have on such important committees?” asked Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. “You’ve talked in the past about removing Ilhan Omar, you’ve talked about removing Adam Schiff, about Eric Swalwell. Will you deliver?”<br /><br />In January, McCarthy told Breitbart News each would be removed from their respective positions on the Intelligence Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee if he were elected speaker with a Republican majority.<br /><br />“I’ll keep that promise,” McCarthy told Bartiromo. McCarthy had already been calling for Swalwell’s resignation from the House Intelligence Committee since details surfaced of the Democrat’s close relationship with a since-vanished Chinese spy.<br /><br />“Eric Swalwell cannot get a security clearance in the public sector,” McCarthy said Sunday. “Why would we ever give him a security clearance and the secrets to America?”<br /><br />“Adam Schiff, who had lied to the American public time and again, we will not allow him to be on the Intel Committee either,” McCarthy added.<br /><br />Schiff’s Rise from Russia<br />Schiff was appointed ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee six months before Donald Trump descended on the golden escalator in 2015. By the time Trump captured the White House, Schiff had become the Democrats’ point man on their prime conspiracy to take down the president and undermine democracy in the form of the Russia hoax. In fact, Schiff was the original Russia hoaxer who claimed repeatedly for years to have evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.<br /><br />Schiff used his perch on the Intelligence Committee to foment fear that the new Republican president was in fact a Russian agent who colluded with the Kremlin for command of the Oval Office. He did so through leaks and testimony to the media which published claims unchecked, making Schiff’s office an apparent ground zero for the false and damaging narrative of Russian collusion.<br /><br />In March 2017, Schiff said on MSNBC “there is more than circumstantial evidence” that Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russian government. Two months later, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel investigation to probe whether Trump was indeed guilty of collusion. The two-year investigation run with unlimited resources would eventually come up short of finding one person on the Trump campaign, let alone Trump himself, that colluded with the Kremlin. Schiff responded to Trump’s exoneration by castigating House Republicans and foreshadowing more to emerge that would implicate Trump in an apparent crime.<br /><br />“In the coming weeks and months, new information will continue to be exposed through enterprising journalism, indictments by the Special Counsel, or continued investigative work by Committee Democrats and our counterparts in the Senate,” Schiff said in a press release. “And each time this new information becomes public, Republicans will be held accountable for abandoning a critical investigation of such vital national importance.”<br /><br />Schiff was right on the money when he claimed more would emerge surrounding the politicized investigations of President Trump, but it’s not Republicans who would end up requiring accountability.<br /><br />Subsequent revelations from courtrooms, The Federalist’s reporting, and the DOJ inspector general would find gross misconduct by the FBI as deep state actors themselves worked in cahoots with Russian operatives to undermine a presidential administration. The FBI even paid for Russian disinformation to frame President Trump.",

          "content": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on Nov. 19 that when he becomes speaker of the House next year, he will remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from the House Foreign Affairs Committee because of her remarks that many deemed anti-Semitic.“We watch anti-Semitism grow, not just on our campuses, but we watched it grow in the halls of Congress,” McCarthy said at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas on Nov. 19.“I promised you last year that as speaker, she [Omar] will no longer be on Foreign Affairs, and I’m keeping that promise,” he told a cheering audience.Omar, a Muslim immigrant of Somali descent, has been condemned for her remarks on the U.S.–Israel relationship several times in recent years, including by the leadership of her own party.In 2019, the first-term congresswoman wrote on Twitter that the U.S. support of Israel is “all about the Benjamins.” That prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats to issue a joint statement, saying that the comment invoked a long-standing anti-Semitic trope and was “deeply offensive.”President Donald Trump also weighed in at that time to call for Omar’s expulsion.“Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress,” Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. “And I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”Plan to Expel Democrats From CommitteesThis isn’t the first time McCarthy has said he wants to expel Omar from her committee assignment. In an interview with Breitbart in January, he said he was planning to oust Reps. Omar, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) from their respective committees if Republicans secure a majority in the House after the midterms.“Ilhan Omar should not be serving on Foreign Affairs,” McCarthy said at that time. “You had Ilhan Omar, who earlier referred to my support for Israel in an earlier Congress was ‘all about the Benjamins’ and never apologized.”McCarthy argued that the two California Democrats shouldn’t stay on the House Intelligence Committee, either. He pointed to Swalwell’s affair with an alleged Chinese Communist Party spy and Schiff’s role in promoting the false assertion that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.“You look at Adam Schiff—he should not be serving on Intel when he has openly, knowingly now used a fake dossier, lied to the American public in the process and doesn’t have any ill will, [and] says he wants to continue to do it.”https://www.theepochtimes.com/kevin-mccarthy-plans-to-oust-ilhan-omar-from-house-committee-for-anti-semitic-comments_4875142.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",
          "contentraw": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on Nov. 19 that when he becomes speaker of the House next year, he will remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from the House Foreign Affairs Committee because of her remarks that many deemed anti-Semitic.<br /><br />“We watch anti-Semitism grow, not just on our campuses, but we watched it grow in the halls of Congress,” McCarthy said at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas on Nov. 19.<br /><br />“I promised you last year that as speaker, she [Omar] will no longer be on Foreign Affairs, and I’m keeping that promise,” he told a cheering audience.<br /><br />Omar, a Muslim immigrant of Somali descent, has been condemned for her remarks on the U.S.–Israel relationship several times in recent years, including by the leadership of her own party.<br /><br />In 2019, the first-term congresswoman wrote on Twitter that the U.S. support of Israel is “all about the Benjamins.” That prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats to issue a joint statement, saying that the comment invoked a long-standing anti-Semitic trope and was “deeply offensive.”<br /><br />President Donald Trump also weighed in at that time to call for Omar’s expulsion.<br /><br />“Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress,” Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. “And I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”<br /><br />Plan to Expel Democrats From Committees<br /><br />This isn’t the first time McCarthy has said he wants to expel Omar from her committee assignment. In an interview with Breitbart in January, he said he was planning to oust Reps. Omar, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) from their respective committees if Republicans secure a majority in the House after the midterms.<br /><br />“Ilhan Omar should not be serving on Foreign Affairs,” McCarthy said at that time. “You had Ilhan Omar, who earlier referred to my support for Israel in an earlier Congress was ‘all about the Benjamins’ and never apologized.”<br /><br />McCarthy argued that the two California Democrats shouldn’t stay on the House Intelligence Committee, either.

Without analyzing the actual data Mack appeared to be content with simply adding up all their “Mass Shootings in 2022” and wrote this:After a week of a pair of mass shootings — an LGBTQ club in Colorado and the University of Virginia — the U.S. total has gone over 600 for the year at a record-setting pace, according to Gun Violence Archive data.Mack added, “A mass shooting is defined as one where four or more people are injured or killed by firearms, which does not include the shooter being stopped.”It was easy then for him to conclude that “mass shootings” are on the upswing: “Nearly 700 mass shootings occurred in 2021, up from 610 in 2020 and just 417 in 2019.”Except that in 2019 there were only 30 mass shootings, according to the FBI. And in 2020, instead of 610 such incidents, the FBI reported only 20, a 50-percent decline over 2019!AWR Hawkins, the Second Amendment writer for Breitbart, explained why: “The GVR standard [when counting mass shootings] is a much lower threshold for qualifying incidents as ‘mass shootings’ than has traditionally been used. In fact, it allows incidents in which there were no fatalities to be counted.… It also allows gang incidents, drive-by shootings, and other common street crimes to be counted as ‘mass shootings.’”Investigative journalist Lee Williams, writing for Armed American News, was much more explicit:According to their new report titled: “Active Shooter Incidents in the United States in 2020,” the FBI defines active shootings as:Shootings in public placesShootings occurring at more than one locationShootings where the shooter’s actions were not the result of another criminal actShootings resulting in a mass killingShootings indicating apparent spontaneity by the shooterShootings where the shooter appeared to methodically search for potential victimsShootings that appeared focused on injury to people, not buildings or objectsShootings were excluded from the FBI’s list if they were the result of:Self-defenseGang violenceDrug violenceContained residential or domestic disputesControlled barricade/hostage situationsCrossfire as a byproduct of another ongoing criminal actAn action that appeared not to have put other people in perilWilliams noted, “By comparison, the Gun Violence Archive excludes nothing, even if the shooting is gang or drug related — the two main causes of most violence in the country today.”Why do mainstream journalists turn so readily to GVA for data on mass shootings? Wrote Wiliams, “Anytime four or more people are killed or even slightly wounded with a firearm, it’s labeled a mass shooting, and politicians, gun control advocates and the mainstream media treat their reports as if they’re gospel.” https://thenewamerican.com/newsmax-gets-it-wrong-on-colorado-springs-shooting/",

At the same time, Dominion has confirmed reports it made a donation to the Clinton Foundation and hired a former Nancy Pelosi staffer as a lobbyist.Dominion has been at the center of a firestorm since Nov. 3, when its election management software, which is widely used across the country, led to an unofficial initial vote count misreporting Joe Biden as beating President Trump in Michigan's Antrim County when, according to election officials, the county clerk neglected to update software used to collect voting data from electronic tabulators.In a lengthy, wide-ranging series of statements on its homepage, Dominion is rejecting claims made in the media and online by critics skeptical of the presidential results who fear that the firm is biased toward Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).Although Dominion did acknowledge that it made a philanthropic donation to a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in 2014, it also stated that the firm \"has no company ownership relationships with any member of the Pelosi family, the Feinstein family, or the Clinton Global Initiative, Smartmatic, Scytl, or any ties to Venezuela.\"Dominion also linked to a Nov. 10 Associated Press report downplaying reports of ties between the election technology firm and prominent Democrats. While acknowledging that it is true that former Pelosi Chief of Staff Nadeam Elshami \"is part of a lobbying team representing Dominion, according to public disclosures,\" the AP dismissed any partisan significance in that connection, noting \"that team also includes Brian Wild, who counts Republicans such as former House Speaker John Boehner and former Vice President Dick Cheney among his past bosses.\"Dominion also swatted down any claims of \"raids\" on Dominion servers by the U.S. military, saying that the company does not have servers in Germany.Allegations against the company could escalate, given claims by an attorney on the Trump campaign election integrity legal team that forthcoming evidence shows the presidential vote count was manipulated using technology from Dominion, a claim the firm soundly rejects.Attorney Sidney Powell alleged in media interviews that Dominion was used to obtain a \"rigged\" outcome for Biden over Trump.Appearing Sunday on Sinclair's \"America This Week with Eric Bolling,\" Powell said her team had uncovered \"mathematical alterations to the votes.\"\"It's a feature of the system that was designed with a backdoor, so that people could watch, in real time, and calculate with an algorithm how many votes they needed to change to make the result they wanted to create,\" Powell told Bolling. \"It's incredibly disturbing, and we will hopefully have evidence of it before the end of the week that we can produce publicly.\"Powell, who has been lead counsel in more than 500 appeals in the Fifth Circuit, also represented Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security advisor, who won a powerful legal victory earlier this year when the U.S. Justice Department recommended a federal judge reverse Flynn's conviction and drop criminal charges, a stunning reversal in a case that became a powerful symbol of FBI misconduct in the Russia investigation. The government said revelations from evidence withheld from the court for years warranted the dramatic recommendation.In its statements on its homepage, Dominion rejected the substance of Powell's claims without naming her.\"Dominion Voting Systems categorically denies false assertions about vote switching issues with our voting systems,\" the homepage stated. \"No credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist.
