All you know how to do is lose, and become more left wing.<br /><br />Even after the rigged elections, Covid lockdowns, black communist violence, and watching video of police stand back and assist a school shooting you guys are voting like everything is normal and fine. Mr. Dondero is a Jewish operative that‚Äôs been spewing this shit for over a decade, and conservatives gobble it right up. I hope conservatives know that you will be blamed just as much as the left for what‚Äôs happening to our country, because you are the left.

          "contentraw": "To the Girls<br /><br />Estabamos hablando en privado acerca del Fin del Exilio y como se ha convertido en prioridad debido al exceso de basura que los spammers han estado acumulando acerca de mi historia, mentiria si dijera que no me he emocionado mientras pensaba en la historia luego de tanto tiempo, debio ser el soundtrack que usaron o tal vez pensar en otros soundtracks que a mi me gustaban pero me he emocionado.<br /><br />Una imagen de los protagonistas de la historia junto a sus respectivos Animales.<br /><br />\"Las Cupulas.\"<br /><br />Los personajes alcanzarian la Tierra en el segundo capitulo porque pens√© que no era correcto hacer esperar a los lectores, en realidad esperaba que El Fin del Exilio fuera una historia corta as√≠ que no veriamos a los personajes instalando una Cupula en ningun planeta que no fuera la Tierra y en La Tierra la atmosfera es respirable as√≠ que no necesitarian instalar una Cupula.<br /><br />Por desgracia los chicos no llevan mucho armamento porque tal y como les he contado a las hermanas, la diferencia entre los personajes de TerraFormars y El Fin del Exilio es que en Terraformars ellos tienen una misi√≥n de exterminio mientras que en esta historia son simplemente colonizadores.<br /><br />Otro detalle que quiero mencionar es que en El Fin del Exilio todos los personajes tenian una ocupaci√≥n, digamos un \"Job\" como en los videojuegos, no se usaban mucho pero cada uno de los miembros tenia una funci√≥n diferente.

            "description": "This group is based on \"Historical Revisionism\" so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal. That much is obvious!

Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here. We can never have too many backup groups. The Only requirement is that it must be based on National Socialism and Historical Revisionism.                                                                                                                                                                                                  https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/feed?referrer=Foghornreturns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brother Groups List                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           These are groups that are similar to this NS group but they are not the same.

            "description_html": "<p>This group is based on &quot;Historical Revisionism&quot; so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. <a href=\"http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.t<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">witter2<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>) No infighting or better yet provoking it.

Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here.

          "content": "With or without Trump: The specter of civil war hovers over the USAThe white rural population feels robbed of their homeland. The cosmopolitan city dwellers feel bullied by the conservative minority. As mutual trust collapses, so do democratic institutions.Republicans, who feel committed to the truth, are dealing with an ugly situation these days: Adam Kinzinger is basically an American conservative with no discernible flaws. After graduation he served as an Air Force pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 2010, the congressman campaigned in Washington on a platform that espoused lean government, that opposed Barack Obama‚Äôs healthcare reform and abortion. Recently however, his wife Sofia received a letter in the post. In it, the senders vowed to execute her husband Adam, herself, and their son Christian.The authors were obviously Christian extremists. They accused Kinzinger of harming not only his country but also ¬´countless patriotic and God-fearing families.¬ª Addressing his wife, they said: ¬´We consider it blasphemy that you have given the name Christian to the son of the devil.¬ªPolitical violence could soon become the normThe murderous rage directed at Kinzinger has nothing to do with his relationship with God though, but rather with his lack of fear of Donald Trump. The 44-year-old was one of only ten Republican members of Congress to vote to impeach Trump‚Äôs following the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Against the wishes of his party leadership, he now also sits on the congressional committee inquiring into the events of January 6. By fighting for the truth, he wants to bring his party, driven by fear and conspiracy theories, back to reason: ¬´We fear the Democrats. We fear the future. We fear everything. This works for one to two election cycles. The problem is that it‚Äôs really hurting our democracy.¬ªPoliticians in other democracies also receive savage threats from angry citizens. But in the U.S., it doesn‚Äôt stop there. Due to his criticism of Trump, Kinzinger is now considered a Rino (Republican in name only) by his party. Trump himself called the Rinos ¬´the lowest form of human life.¬ª Around the time that Kinzinger received the threatening letter, Eric Greitens, the Republican candidate for the Senate in Missouri, also posted a campaign ad on the internet.

          "contentraw": "With or without Trump: The specter of civil war hovers over the USA<br />The white rural population feels robbed of their homeland. The cosmopolitan city dwellers feel bullied by the conservative minority. As mutual trust collapses, so do democratic institutions.Republicans, who feel committed to the truth, are dealing with an ugly situation these days: Adam Kinzinger is basically an American conservative with no discernible flaws. After graduation he served as an Air Force pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 2010, the congressman campaigned in Washington on a platform that espoused lean government, that opposed Barack Obama‚Äôs healthcare reform and abortion. Recently however, his wife Sofia received a letter in the post. In it, the senders vowed to execute her husband Adam, herself, and their son Christian.<br /><br /><br />The authors were obviously Christian extremists. They accused Kinzinger of harming not only his country but also ¬´countless patriotic and God-fearing families.¬ª Addressing his wife, they said: ¬´We consider it blasphemy that you have given the name Christian to the son of the devil.¬ª<br /><br />Political violence could soon become the norm<br />The murderous rage directed at Kinzinger has nothing to do with his relationship with God though, but rather with his lack of fear of Donald Trump. The 44-year-old was one of only ten Republican members of Congress to vote to impeach Trump‚Äôs following the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Against the wishes of his party leadership, he now also sits on the congressional committee inquiring into the events of January 6. By fighting for the truth, he wants to bring his party, driven by fear and conspiracy theories, back to reason: ¬´We fear the Democrats. We fear the future. We fear everything. This works for one to two election cycles. The problem is that it‚Äôs really hurting our democracy.¬ª<br /><br />Politicians in other democracies also receive savage threats from angry citizens. But in the U.S., it doesn‚Äôt stop there. Due to his criticism of Trump, Kinzinger is now considered a Rino (Republican in name only) by his party. Trump himself called the Rinos ¬´the lowest form of human life.¬ª Around the time that Kinzinger received the threatening letter, Eric Greitens, the Republican candidate for the Senate in Missouri, also posted a campaign ad on the internet. In the video ad he‚Äôs holding a rifle in his hands and saying: ¬´Today we‚Äôre going Rino hunting.¬ª Accompanied by a heavily armed task force, the former governor then breaks down a door and challenges his constituents: ¬´Get a license to hunt Rinos. It won‚Äôt expire until we save our country.¬ª",

Do not get caught up in all this ‚Äôcause it isn‚Äôt gonna change anything. It‚Äôs fun to go through it, dissect it, and pick it apart. But don‚Äôt think any of this is gonna change anything. Comey‚Äôs out there giving red meat to all sides. In the process, though, this guy‚Äôs doing some amazing things. He‚Äôs admitting that he‚Äôs a coward. He admitted that he let Loretta Lynch shape the language used in describing the Hillary investigation.He has admitted that she pressured him to do that and that he fell for her pressure. He has admitted to orchestrating a memo leak! You know, the famous memos that Comey was said to have? When we first heard about Comey‚Äôs memos, we were told that Comey had, as a general practice throughout all of his years as a lawyer ‚Äî after big meetings ‚Äî that he would memorialize what had happened, who had said what, as an exercise in remembering what was said or in preserving the record should there be disputes.We were told that he‚Äôd been doing this for quite a while, which led me to ask publicly here, ‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôd like to see some of the memos he wrote after conversations with Obama.‚Äù Well, then we learned that he never had but two conversations with Obama and really only one. The second one was when Obama called to say good-bye after he was leaving office, and the other time was talking about ‚Äî I forget ‚Äî whatever it was. But I‚Äôm sitting here thinking, is this‚Ä¶?We‚Äôre supposed to believe with Obama over there in the White House and Eric Holder here as attorney general, then Loretta Lynch, that Comey (chuckling) never, never was aware what Obama wanted? It‚Äôs kind of like Lois Lerner. Everybody was saying they hoped they‚Äôd find the smoking gun memo that directed her to discriminate against Tea Party groups at the IRS. You‚Äôre never gonna find that because one‚Äôs not needed. Obama hires like-minded people who know what to do without having to be told.I think Comey is shaping up to be one of these people. Anyway, we later learned that Comey only started writing memos after he met Trump, because he thought Trump was a liar, and he thought Trump was a mean person, because Trump was lying about him and lying about the FBI. So what did our brave, young FBI director do? Well, he called a buddy of his at the Columbia School of Journalism, Columbia University, and asked him to ‚Äúshare‚Äù his memos. This is not ‚Äúsharing‚Äù anything; this is leaking!Comey: Loretta Lynch asked me to call Clinton email investigation a 'matter,' which concerned me",
