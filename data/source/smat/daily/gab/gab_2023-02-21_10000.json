I kept thinking of the passage in Deuteronomy (requoted in Romans) where it says the Word is near you, but she just couldn&#39;t confess Him as Lord because, just like the Pharisees, she has Abraham as her father, and she couldn&#39;t get past her Jewish identity.  Of course, if she were truly committed to the truth of the Old Testament, she would have no choice but to accept Jesus as the Messiah.&quot;Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father.
