I know you need to look good to your fellow idiots in your \"echo chamber\", but I'm not interested in making you <br />\"look good\" to delusional morons who are totally disconnected from the truth and reality. You idiots have no understanding, and are utterly irrational fools who are only motivated by your fear, stupidity, ignorance and hate.<br /><br />Explaining anything to you is a waste of time, obviously. Any of the Trumps are brain dead, immoral, selfish, soulless, selfish beings. Eric and Junior barely have a functional nervous system that struggles just to tell them to keep breathing and stay alive. A joke of course moron, but a very adequate representation of their intelligence, and the mental state of every on of you Trump Cult ass kissers.

Daily Mail--------------------------------------------------------------------A transgender teen is in custody after authorities say they recovered a manifesto detailing her plan to attack three schools and churches in Colorado just four days after Audrey Hale murdered six people at the Covenant School in Nashville. William Whitworth, 19, who goes by the name Lilly and is referred to with female pronouns in arrest documents, was arrested on March 31. She was a student in the school district that she planned to attack between 2014 and 2016, authorities say. In a manifesto that was recovered in her home, Whitworth called Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold 'losers,' said that Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza was 'smart' and that ex-President Donald Trump was a 'con man.' She was also in possession of The Communist Manifesto. The suspect is charged with two counts of criminal attempt to commit murder in the first degree, criminal mischief, menacing and interference with staff, faculty or students of educational institutions. Police were called to Whitworth's home by the suspect's sister who reported that the suspect was exhibiting violent behavior and making threats. Someone at the home told responding officers that Whitworth was 'very upset' and had 'punched holes in a wall.'A spokesperson for he 18th Judicial District Attorney's Office told the Colorado Springs Gazette that Whitworth is in the process of transitioning from male to female. All of the schools targeted by Whitworth have an armed school resource officer on campus who is a member of the Colorado Springs Police Department. http://DailyMail.com has learned that Whitworth's mother is registered homeschool teacher in the district.  The officers who went to the suspect's home said that Whitworth was drunk, sitting on her bed, which had brown stained sheets.When asked if she planned to shoot up a school, she responded with a head nod, it is claimed. When asked why she wanted to do it, Whitworth allegedly replied: 'Why does anyone do it?''Once entering the home there was trash piled up all around the house to where it made it hard to walk inside. There were numerous containers filled with half eaten food with mold growing inside and numerous alcoholic beverage containers laying around the house,' one section of the arrest affidavit reads. Whitworth said that there was 'no specific reason' that she wanted to shoot up Timberview Middle School, a school where she was once a student, according to cops. She is said to have referred to Timberview as her 'main target.' https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11948149/Transgender-Colorado-woman-19-arrested-plot-shoot-THREE-schools-churches.html",

          "content": "A ‚Äúcult‚Äù is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù, but that‚Äôs another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There‚Äôs ALWAYS someone else as a ‚Äúleader‚Äù. Examples: Charles ‚ÄúTaze‚Äù Russell of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It‚Äôs cults which add to Calvary, not the Gospel message (1 John 3:23, 1 John 5:10). Those born again will automatically ‚Äúremain‚Äù in Jesus.An incorrect version of ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù exists in ANY cult which includes those ‚Äúsalvation by works‚Äù people. It‚Äôs totally impossible to ‚Äúearn a gift‚Äù. No ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù in false religions. One doesn‚Äôt HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn‚Äôt teach anything like either ‚Äúsalvation by works‚Äù or ‚Äúreligion‚Äù (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father). Seventh Day Adventism is probably the creepiest cult out there. All of the others are blatant fakes but SDA merely ‚Äúblends in like another denomination‚Äù (whatever a ‚Äúdenomination‚Äù is...).It‚Äôs not even REMOTELY close, actually. The list is long. That‚Äôs tragic, actually. Forever‚Äôs a long time.By contrast, salvation is ‚ÄúJust Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything‚Äù. (‚ÄúThe Gospel message ONLY‚Äù, in other words ‚Äì Keyword: ‚ÄúONLY‚Äù) (See Romans 5:10 for more information). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor.

          "contentraw": "A ‚Äúcult‚Äù is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù, but that‚Äôs another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There‚Äôs ALWAYS someone else as a ‚Äúleader‚Äù. Examples: Charles ‚ÄúTaze‚Äù Russell of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It‚Äôs cults which add to Calvary, not the Gospel message (1 John 3:23, 1 John 5:10). Those born again will automatically ‚Äúremain‚Äù in Jesus.<br /><br />An incorrect version of ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù exists in ANY cult which includes those ‚Äúsalvation by works‚Äù people. It‚Äôs totally impossible to ‚Äúearn a gift‚Äù. No ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù in false religions. One doesn‚Äôt HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn‚Äôt teach anything like either ‚Äúsalvation by works‚Äù or ‚Äúreligion‚Äù (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father). Seventh Day Adventism is probably the creepiest cult out there. All of the others are blatant fakes but SDA merely ‚Äúblends in like another denomination‚Äù (whatever a ‚Äúdenomination‚Äù is...).It‚Äôs not even REMOTELY close, actually. The list is long. That‚Äôs tragic, actually. Forever‚Äôs a long time.<br /><br />By contrast, salvation is ‚ÄúJust Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything‚Äù. (‚ÄúThe Gospel message ONLY‚Äù, in other words ‚Äì Keyword: ‚ÄúONLY‚Äù) (See Romans 5:10 for more information). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren‚Äôt robots. A person ultimately only affects him or herself and forever‚Äôs a long time. We‚Äôre under grace.

A week later, he released names and ranks of the nine soldiers that allegedly died in the ‚Äúaccident‚Äù and announced that search and rescue teams had recovered the flight data recorders from the wreckage, although he shared no details on what the black boxes recorded prior to the crashes.A Real Raw News investigation into the incident demonstrably demolishes the official narrative as entirely fictitious.Sources in General Eric M. Smith‚Äôs office told RRN that nine soldiers died the night of March 31 and were members of the 101st Airborne Division and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, but not the ones named by the regime‚Äôs corrupt Dept. of Defense.The actual soldiers, he said, were White Hats killed in action when the Blackhawks ‚Äúexploded in flight‚Äù while on a mission to apprehend a Deep Stater suspected of harboring underage children at his residence in southern Illinois. Gen. Smith‚Äôs office is withholding the identities of the deceased and the name of the Deep Stater for reasons of operational security.Immediately after the incident, White Hats raced against the clock to salvage wreckage before soldiers loyal to the criminal Biden regime‚Äîor Black Hats‚Äìreached and sealed off the crash site.Our source explained that Fort Campbell is currently home to both White Hats and soldiers who have sworn fealty to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, with garrison commander Col. Andrew Jordon standing for the White Hats and senior commander Gen. Joseph Mcgee representing the Biden loyalists. The leadership rift and status of forces at Fort Campbell is beyond the scope of this article, but the tenuous split will be covered in the future. The chain of command is fractured.Within an hour of the crash, a White Hat recovery team arrived at the ‚Äúaccident‚Äù scene‚Äîan open field across from a residential area‚Äîand extinguished pieces of flaming debris. All that remained of the choppers, which had flown at an altitude of only 250 ft. above ground level, was a twisted sprawl of mangled metal. The broken and burned corpses of nine heroic White Hats lay amid the wreckage. A limbless body with charred flesh had been thrown from the wreck. Another had an aluminum tube, a piece of a seat frame, protruding through his chest. The damage and dismemberments, our source said, were inconsistent with a low-altitude helicopter collision.The recovery team freed what remains it could and placed them, along with some helicopter debris, on M35 2¬Ω-ton cargo trucks, which egressed the vicinity and began the long drive to Fort Bragg, minutes before regime forces and local law enforcement showed up to cordon off the site.At Bragg, a metallurgist contracted to the Army Corps of Engineers performed chemical spot and Infrared spectroscopy tests on an instrument panel, a shattered pilot‚Äôs helmet, other components, and structural fragments. He deduced that significant damage on both helicopters was consistent with an explosive device detonating in either the cockpit or crew cabin, and he found tiny particles of C-4, a common variety of plastic explosives.The medical examiner at Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, attested to the explosive theory upon examining the bodily remains of the fallen soldiers. Their wounds‚Äîan eye blown into its socket and a shredded, severed arm, for example‚Äîwere incongruent with a low-altitude collision and crash.A preliminary report from Gen. Smith‚Äôs office concluded that several pounds of plastic explosives‚Äîrigged with a timer or intentionally triggered by occupants on both Blackhawks‚Äîexploded in or near the cockpits and were a catalyst for the deadly crashes. If the blast didn‚Äôt outright kill them, the crash certainly did, the report ruled.‚ÄúThis was sabotage,‚Äù our source said. ‚ÄúWe know what happened, and we‚Äôre damn near certain why it happened, but we‚Äôre still clueless why the DoD fabricated the names of the dead. We couldn‚Äôt get all the remains, and even though our operatives don‚Äôt wear [dog] tags on sensitive missions, by now the DoD has checked the dead against dental records. It‚Äôs safe to assume they have a good idea who was in those birds. We know none of the nine the DoD named were on those Blackhawks.‚ÄùThree, he added, couldn‚Äôt have been on the choppers because military records showed them on leave, hundreds or thousands of miles away, when the flight left Fort Campbell.What‚Äôs puzzling is that all nine on the DoD‚Äôs flight log have vanished from the face of the planet.",
