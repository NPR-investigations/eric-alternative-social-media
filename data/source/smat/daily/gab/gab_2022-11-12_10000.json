            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

            "description": "Eric Zemmour était l’invité de BFMTV ce vendredi 11 Novembre, en marge de son déplacement à la Base Navale de Toulon pour manifester l’opposition d’une grande partie des français au débarquement du navire Ocean Viking. Le dirigeant de Reconquête a été confronté à une journaliste visiblement de mauvaise foi sur la question et apportant toujours des objections d’un niveau assez bas à ses propos. Il n’a pas été difficile pour Eric Zemmour de montrer à quel point les arguments des 3 journalistes présents sur le plateau étaient fallacieux et que la situation concernait bien plus que 234 migrants, mais bel et bien le destin de la France. Retrouvez l’entretien complet d’Eric Zemmour sur BFMTV :",

Approximately a third of voters rated it the most important issue, and as a result 7 in 10 of them cast votes for Republicans, Edison Research exit polls show. What is perhaps not clear to the average American is how unrestrained spending on Ukraine and a U.S. energy policy that puts Europe first contributed to skyrocketing inflation and the cost of living reaching unbearable levels for American families. As new Republican members enter the halls of Congress, it is time to turn the “America First” rhetoric into policies that push back against the establishment.It is no secret that the U.S. posture toward Ukraine has now evolved from arm’s length, emergency support to full-on alliance without a formal treaty. It seems every time more military aid goes out to Ukraine, there are calls from Ukraine for yet more, and establishment members of Congress are all too eager to cut seemingly endless checks. Total aid passed by Congress is now greater than $66 billion, making Ukraine the single greatest recipient of security assistance in a single year since the Vietnam era.Blank-check diplomacy is already creating a clash between Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. McConnell has more or less led the charge on overzealous aid to Ukraine. McCarthy, who is looking to become House speaker should Republicans reclaim the chamber, rallied a vote against another $12.3 billion in military and economic aid for Ukraine. McCarthy tied his position back to the economic pressures that out-of-control spending has placed on the backs of the American people, saying, “I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.” Big-name newly elected members agree with him.

Their goal is an international rules based or-der where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State.

Their goal is an international rules based or-der where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State.

Jasper told Alex Newman for this special episode of Behind The Deep State. Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nation-alists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to “kidnap” Michigan Gov. Whitmer.

Bobert is a CFR and billionaire Bilderberger homosexual Peter Thiel and homosexual promoting Donald Trump pro-lgbt log-cabin backed candidate being used to queer the GOP and promoting lgbtq deviancy as a human right acceptable to both Progressives and Conservatives. Which isn't true at all.<br /><br />This is being done to kill true American patriots freedom of speech and freedom of religion rights and destroy the US constitution, religion, and the traditional family. If Lauren wants to run she should be doing so as a Democrat Progressive not a Republican Conservative. Maybe then she would have been elected instead of storage locker pervert Democrat Progressive Frisch.

          "content": "THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY—CAROL SWAINWhen you think about racial equality and civil rights, which political party comes to mind? The Republicans? Or, the Democrats? Most people would probably say the Democrats. But this answer is incorrect.Since its founding in 1829, the Democratic Party has fought against every major civil rights initiative, and has a long history of discrimination.The Democratic Party defended slavery, started the Civil War, opposed Reconstruction, founded the Ku Klux Klan, imposed segregation, perpetrated lynchings, and fought against the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s.In contrast, the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Its mission was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territories with the aim of abolishing it entirely. This effort, however, was dealt a major blow by the Supreme Court. In the 1857 case Dred Scott v. Sandford, the court ruled that slaves aren’t citizens; they’re property. The seven justices who voted in favor of slavery? All Democrats. The two justices who dissented? Both Republicans.The slavery question was, of course, ultimately resolved by a bloody civil war. The commander- in-chief during that war was the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln – the man who freed the slaves.Six days after the Confederate army surrendered, John Wilkes Booth, a Democrat, assassinated President Lincoln. Lincoln’s vice president, a Democrat named Andrew Johnson, assumed the presidency. But Johnson adamantly opposed Lincoln’s plan to integrate the newly freed slaves into the South’s economic and social order.Johnson and the Democratic Party were unified in their opposition to the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery; the 14th Amendment, which gave blacks citizenship; and the 15th Amendment, which gave blacks the vote. All three passed only because of universal Republican support.During the era of Reconstruction, federal troops stationed in the south helped secure rights for the newly freed slaves. Hundreds of black men were elected to southern state legislatures as Republicans, and 22 black Republicans served in the US Congress by 1900. The Democrats did not elect a black man to Congress until 1935.But after Reconstruction ended, when the federal troops went home, Democrats roared back  Free Courses for Free Minds.cominto power in the South. They quickly reestablished white supremacy across the region with measures like black codes – laws that restricted the ability of blacks to own property and run businesses. And they imposed poll taxes and literacy tests, used to subvert the black citizen’s right to vote.And how was all of this enforced? By terror -- much of it instigated by the Ku Klux Klan, founded by a Democrat, Nathan Bedford Forrest.As historian Eric Foner - himself a Democrat - notes:“In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party.”President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, shared many views with the Klan.

          "contentraw": "THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY—CAROL SWAIN<br /><br />When you think about racial equality and civil rights, which political party comes to mind? The Republicans? Or, the Democrats? Most people would probably say the Democrats. But this answer is incorrect.<br /><br />Since its founding in 1829, the Democratic Party has fought against every major civil rights initiative, and has a long history of discrimination.<br /><br />The Democratic Party defended slavery, started the Civil War, opposed Reconstruction, founded the Ku Klux Klan, imposed segregation, perpetrated lynchings, and fought against the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s.<br />In contrast, the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Its mission was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territories with the aim of abolishing it entirely. This effort, however, was dealt a major blow by the Supreme Court. In the 1857 case Dred Scott v. Sandford, the court ruled that slaves aren’t citizens; they’re property. The seven justices who voted in favor of slavery? All Democrats. The two justices who dissented? Both Republicans.<br /><br />The slavery question was, of course, ultimately resolved by a bloody civil war. The commander- in-chief during that war was the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln – the man who freed the slaves.<br /><br />Six days after the Confederate army surrendered, John Wilkes Booth, a Democrat, assassinated President Lincoln. Lincoln’s vice president, a Democrat named Andrew Johnson, assumed the presidency. But Johnson adamantly opposed Lincoln’s plan to integrate the newly freed slaves into the South’s economic and social order.<br /><br />Johnson and the Democratic Party were unified in their opposition to the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery; the 14th Amendment, which gave blacks citizenship; and the 15th Amendment, which gave blacks the vote. All three passed only because of universal Republican support.<br />During the era of Reconstruction, federal troops stationed in the south helped secure rights for the newly freed slaves. Hundreds of black men were elected to southern state legislatures as Republicans, and 22 black Republicans served in the US Congress by 1900. The Democrats did not elect a black man to Congress until 1935.<br /><br />But after Reconstruction ended, when the federal troops went home, Democrats roared back<br />  Free Courses for Free Minds<br />.com<br /><br />into power in the South. They quickly reestablished white supremacy across the region with measures like black codes – laws that restricted the ability of blacks to own property and run businesses. And they imposed poll taxes and literacy tests, used to subvert the black citizen’s right to vote.<br />And how was all of this enforced? By terror -- much of it instigated by the Ku Klux Klan, founded by a Democrat, Nathan Bedford Forrest.<br /><br />As historian Eric Foner - himself a Democrat - notes:<br />“In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party.”<br /><br />President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, shared many views with the Klan. He re-segregated many federal agencies, and even screened the first movie ever played at the White House - the racist film “The Birth of a Nation,” originally entitled “The Clansman.”<br /><br />A few decades later, the only serious congressional opposition to the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 came from Democrats.<br /><br />Eighty percent of Republicans in Congress supported the bill. Less than 70 percent of Democrats did. Democratic senators filibustered the bill for 75 days, until Republicans mustered the few extra votes needed to break the logjam.<br />And when all of their efforts to enslave blacks, keep them enslaved, and then keep them from voting had failed, the Democrats came up with a new strategy: If black people are going to vote, they might as well vote for Democrats.

But somewhere along the line, the office went completely off the rails. Eliot Spitzer was elected AG in 1998, and spent his two terms in frightening misuse of the office to further his naked political ambitions, mainly through shaking down financial institutions on the thinnest of pretexts. After eight years improperly using this tactic to keep his name in the headlines, he was then elected Governor; whereupon his successor — Andrew Cuomo — followed the same playbook for one term, and with the same result of becoming Governor. The next guy, Eric Schneiderman, was, if this is even possible, the worst of the three in the category of politicized prosecutions and shakedowns. Mercifully, Schneiderman was forced from office in a sex scandal before he could move up to the governorship.In the 2018 election, we got a woman named Letitia James. By this time, all pretense that the Attorney General ought to be an impartial law enforcement officer had been long forgotten. James not only made no secret, but actually bragged and campaigned on her intention to misuse the powers of the office to go after political enemies, most particularly Donald Trump, who was President at the time. And, she promised, she would not just sue Trump in his capacity as President for allegedly exceeding his constitutional powers, but she would go after him personally in any way she could, to try to destroy him. The following quote is a summary from the Buffalo News on October 30, 2018, in the run-up to that election:Democrat Letitia James promises much more than simply opposing President Trump should she win her Nov. 6 election for New York attorney general against Republican Keith Wofford. Indeed, she will continue current Attorney General Barbara Underwood’s litigation against Trump policies on immigration, civil rights, the environment and minorities. But she promises even more scrutiny of the president’s personal and corporate finances, his real estate holdings, whether he has dodged taxes, and more.That was just under four years ago. In the intervening years, there have been public indications from time to time that some kind of big investigation was going on (for example, court filings involving Trump’s accounting firm Mazars), but never any charges. Meanwhile, there was a companion criminal investigation of Trump going on in the Manhattan DA’s office. (In New York, the AG has only certain limited criminal jurisdiction, and most criminal jurisdiction rests in the county DAs.). The Manhattan DA conducting that investigation, Cyrus Vance, Jr., retired at the end of 2021, and a new guy, Alvin Bragg, took over at the start of this year. Bragg promptly held a review of his office’s Trump criminal investigation, and decided to walk away from it. I covered that subject in a March 11 post here.But Letitia James is running for re-election in November, less than two months away. She needs to get her name in the news. Does she have anything at all to show for her four years of effort pursuing Trump?This morning James held a big press conference to announce the filing of a 214 page Complaint against Trump. A full copy of the Complaint can be found at this link (via NBC News).Once again, I’ve wasted some valuable hours of my life, and here is my evaluation: What an embarrassment! After almost four years and a big team of full-time investigators just to chase this one white whale, could this really be all she has?First, there are no criminal charges. This is purely a civil complaint. Admittedly the NY AG’s office has limited criminal jurisdiction, but it does have some important areas of criminal jurisdiction (notably a securities statute called the Martin Act).

We are very grateful for the Court’s ruling,” Stanley commented.Smith attended a school board meeting in 2021 to speak out against the school’s failure to protect his daughter from a cross-dressing predator following her sexual assault in a bathroom in May at Stone Bridge High School in Ashburn. A video surfaced after the meeting showing police cuffing, roughing up, and dragging out the plumber who accused the board of a cover-up of the assault.…The male student’s identity was never released. He was charged with sexual assault at two separate high schools and was found guilty in 2022.The father was convicted of two misdemeanors following the school board meeting. The charges included disorderly conduct and obstruction of justice. Circuit Court Judge James Plowman had previously dismissed Smith’s count of obstruction of justice and the father is now attempting to appeal the disorderly conduct count.Plowman ordered on Sept. 2 that a special prosecutor be appointed in Smith’s appeal which effectively removed Biberaj and her office from the case.“There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not a direct conflict exists that would mandate removal and/or disqualification of the Loudoun County Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office,” Plowman’s order contends.“The concerns about the public confidence in the integrity of the prosecution as well as the Defendant’s concerns regarding the impartiality of the Commonwealth’s Attorney are sufficiently grounded. As a result, the integrity of the Defendant’s due process rights is in jeopardy and must be protected,” the judge charged.…How callous, disgusting for that prosecutor, Loudoun County Commonwealth’s Attorney Buta Biberaj to charge this father with anything! OMG…“A fair system of criminal justice that is void of both bias and political agendas is the cornerstone of a free society,” Smith said in a comment from his press release that was given to Fox News Digital. “From the beginning, Ms. Biberaj has sought to make an example of me for simply standing up to defend my daughter at the now infamous Loudoun County School Board meeting. Buta Biberaj has demonstrated a bias against me throughout the court proceedings, and she has continued to fan the flames of those who would label parents like me who stand in protection of their kids against dangerous school policies as being ‘domestic terrorists.’”“Nothing could be further from the truth,” he asserted.“Buta’s off the case that’s what we wanted. On to fair equal justice hopefully. We look forward to clearing our name, my name, and the family’s name. It hasn’t been a really good look,” Smith remarked, according to ABC 7 News.“I’m surprised by the court’s decision since I was never given the opportunity to come back and have conversations about the disorderly conduct,” Biberaj…“Judge Plowman called me to ask if I was available,” Stafford County Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric Olsen told the media outlet. “As is often the case, a special prosecutor can be necessary because of potential conflict of interest.”Stanley is adamant that Smith deserves a fair trial.“Believe it or not, prosecutors are supposed to be impartial. They’re supposed to look at the facts, apply the law and if so, then prosecute. This seemed to turn very political, very quickly, in the battle in Loudoun County, between this prosecutor who had been funded by George Soros,” the attorney commented, asserting that Biberaj “took it upon herself to personally prosecute” the case.",

Examples:Why on earth would you waste time at some “Seventh Day Adventist thing”?Why on earth would you waste time at some “Roman Catholic thing”?Why on earth would you waste time at some “Kingdom Hall”?Why on earth would you waste time at some “Mormon Temple”?Why on earth would you waste time at some “Synagogue”?You get the idea...There are literally dozens of each, cults and false religions but if you’re born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm ), feel free to ignore every single one of them. The bottom line is they realistically have no idea what they’re talking about. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of those types of “salvation by works” cults and false religions. On the other hand, Titus 3:9-11 is aimed directly at Judaism and contains instructions for those born again regarding those wrapped up in it.  “I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late ALWAYS sounds better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is. (SIDE NOTE - Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). The Lord is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.(SIDE NOTE - The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you. It’s more accurate and allowing Him to live in you is more feasible than merely trying to imitate behavior(s).In Hebrews 10:14, “For all time” means (may I have a drumroll, please) “For all time”. (That’s spiritually-speaking, or course. The rest of you? Welcome to being human.)(SIDE NOTE – In some translations, “For all time” is worded as “Forever”, “To the end” or “For eternity”.)",
