            "description": "Eric Dubay on Gab: 'Flat Earth FAQ by Eric Dubay:  http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubay  Flat Earth FAQ is the ultimate reference guide for concise, comprehensive answers to the most frequently asked flat Earth questions accompanied with detailed drawings, maps, memes, charts, and full-color photographs as helpful visual aids. Written by the President of the International Flat Earth Research Society and author of several other flat Earth books and documentaries, Eric Dubay recommends Flat Earth FAQ as both an ideal introduction to the subject for beginners, and a perfect coffee-table book for established flat earthers looking to tackle all the typical talking points.\n\nTable of Contents:\n1. How Do You Know Earth is Not a Spinning Globe?\n2. How Do You Know NASA Faked the Moon Landings?\n3. Why Would They Lie About Flat Earth?\n4. Why are There No Flat Earth Whistle-Blowers?\n5. Why are There No Photographs of the Flat Earth?\n6. Why is Earth the Only Flat Planet?\n7. Why Can't Everyone See Mount Everest on a Flat Earth?\n8. Why isn't Polaris Visible from Australia?\n9. Why Does the Moon Appear Upside-Down in the Southern Hemisphere?\n10. Why Do the Sun/Moon Get Bigger Near the Horizon?\n11. Ships Disappear Beyond Earth's Curvature?\n12. Earth's Curvature Visible From Your Airplane Window?\n13. Eratosthenes Experiment Debunks Flat Earth?\n14. Cavendish Experiment Proves Gravity?\n15. Foucault Pendulums Prove the Earth Rotates?\n16. Coriolis Effect Proves Earth a Spinning Globe?\n17. Mount Rainier's Shadow Proves the Globe?\n18. The Lake Pontchartrain Bridge Shows Earth's Curvature?\n19. How Do Maps, Compasses and Circumnavigation Work on Flat Earth?\n20. How Do Flights Like Sydney-Santiago Work on Flat Earth?\n21. How Does Gravity Work on Flat Earth?\n22. How Do Sunrise and Sunset Work on Flat Earth?\n23. How Do Seasons Work on the Flat Earth?\n24. How Does the Midnight Sun Work on Flat Earth?\n25. How Do Eclipses Work on Flat Earth?\n26. How Do the Southern Stars Work on Flat Earth?\n27. How Do Tides Work on Flat Earth?\n28. How Do Volcanoes and Earthquakes Work on Flat Earth?\n29. How Can Ushuaia Get 17 Hours of Daylight on a Flat Earth?\n30. What is Above, Below, and Beyond the Flat Earth?\n31. How Did You Personally Learn About Flat Earth?\n32. Why is Flat Earth Important?\n\nThe beautiful custom designed cover art is by fellow flat earther and artist Dino.  Dino is a self-taught artist, musician & teacher from Boston whose work can be found at http://www.ARTofDiNo.com (artofdino@gmail.com). Together with his wife Erin Sarah of http://www.ARTofErinSarah.com, they formed a 501c3 public charity known as Save eARTh (http://www.SaveeARTh.us) with the goal of Saving eARTh with Art and HeART forever. Each Artwork is designed to expand the minds of all people of all ages in order to help everyone envision the infinite realm of potential we are all collectively re-discovering. These visions are meticulously crafted and packed with interconnecting symbolism that weaves a timeless story based on the perceptions of the viewer.\n\nFlat Earth FAQ is the culmination of over a decade's worth of deep research and writing on this most important subject jam-packed into an easily digestible reference book available in paperback, PDF and EPub/Kindle versions.  As many of you know, I have vowed never to stop my activism until the NWO dies or I do, and I see flat Earth as the Achilles' Heel of the New World Order.  This subject, supposedly the most crackpot of all conspiracy theories, mocked and ridiculed for centuries as being an ignorant unscientific worldview, is actually one of the most easily demonstrable and empirically evidenced facts of reality.  When humanity finally wakes up to the truth of our flat Earth, it will usher in a veritable new age of enlightenment, a renaissance of common sense, and an opportunity to finally and forever expose and expunge these deceivers among us.  As with all of my books, the contents will all soon be available FREE in article, video, and audiobook forms for those who cannot afford them.  Thanks so much to everyone who has helped over the years to support me and my mission of spreading the flat Earth truth to the entire flat world by purchasing and giving away my books to anyone and everyone who will read them!  http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubay'",

Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured.

Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth.

I have always been aware that most men are not inherently good, let alone perfectible. Yet, I have, until recently, never believed in conspiracies, and was anything but a conspiracy theorist.

Nigs gonna nig.\"New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) handed down a warning to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) after she said she plans to appear at a pro-Trump rally in New York on the day of the former president’s arraignment: “Be on your best behavior.”“People like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is known to spread misinformation and hate speech … she stated she’s coming to town,” Adams said at a press conference on Monday. “While you’re in town, be on your best behavior.”Greene said she will join the New York Young Republican Club for a “peaceful protest” on Tuesday as former President Trump is expected to appear in court after being indicted last week in the investigation into hush money paid to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.Greene said Sunday on Twitter she was going to be protesting “this unprecedented abuse of our justice system and election interference.”Trump and his allies have framed the indictment from the New York grand jury as a political witch hunt targeting the now-presidential candidate, making him the first sitting or former president to face criminal charges. But Greene’s decision to attend the protest marks a reversal by the firebrand lawmaker, who initially shot down the idea of demonstrations.“I changed my mind because we — it’s our First Amendment right,” Greene said in an interview with Semafor. “And we have a right to protest. And it’s so absolutely horrible what Alvin Bragg has done, and he’s truly crossed the line with our justice system.”Adams said New York authorities would not tolerate violence at any of the protests in the city.“As always, we will not allow violence or vandalism of any kind,” Adams said. “If one is caught participating in any act of violence, they will be arrested and held accountable.”Adams also said that there had been no specific, credible threats in the city and urged New Yorkers to go about their days tomorrow in a normal fashion.Greene said she would reject any violence, saying on Twitter those who resort to violence are “not one of us, you are one of them.”“I also reject any attempt and anyone who dresses in MAGA [Make America Great Again] but incites violence or commits violence while pretending to be one of us,” Greene said. “You are not one of us, you are one of them.”",

But Greene’s decision to attend the protest marks a reversal by the firebrand lawmaker, who initially shot down the idea of demonstrations.<br /><br />“I changed my mind because we — it’s our First Amendment right,” Greene said in an interview with Semafor. “And we have a right to protest. And it’s so absolutely horrible what Alvin Bragg has done, and he’s truly crossed the line with our justice system.”<br /><br />Adams said New York authorities would not tolerate violence at any of the protests in the city.<br /><br />“As always, we will not allow violence or vandalism of any kind,” Adams said. “If one is caught participating in any act of violence, they will be arrested and held accountable.”<br /><br />Adams also said that there had been no specific, credible threats in the city and urged New Yorkers to go about their days tomorrow in a normal fashion.<br /><br />Greene said she would reject any violence, saying on Twitter those who resort to violence are “not one of us, you are one of them.”<br /><br />“I also reject any attempt and anyone who dresses in MAGA [Make America Great Again] but incites violence or commits violence while pretending to be one of us,” Greene said. “You are not one of us, you are one of them.”",

Perhaps some weeding is in order. It is for you to learn to nurture those plants which you desire, which are beautiful and serving you, and to prune away some of the dead and useless underbrush. Perhaps you need to pull some weeds. You have all been doing this in your lives. In fact, it is rather difficult to avoid this process, there is so much energy and light flowing through your bodies and your beings. It is becoming more and more difficult to look the other way and ignore what is growing within you. Your attention is being called continuously to what is within yourself, and to the reflections that you receive of yourself from your external experiences. They are all reflections of what is growing within your own garden, all reflections of the current state of affairs in your own emotional and mental bodies. So whatever you are reaping externally is what you have growing within you. You have fed certain parts of yourselves. Those are the parts which you have given nurturance to and which will be strong. There are other parts which you have not given your full attention to, and they may need some additional care in order for you to become balanced. So, in a way you could say that self-mastery is mastering your own feelings and thoughts. It is paying attention to what you are creating, to the seeds you are sowing in each moment. It is in the past that the seeds were down for this moment of experience. So self mastery is attending to what you are creating in this moment, so that you may experience what you desire to experience in future moments. You want to plant only the seeds that you desire to bring forth in your life. This requires attentiveness to your creations, to what you are feeding with your attention. How does this garden grow? How do you plan these seeds? By your attention. There is no water required in this garden. It is the water of your own attention. Whatever you give your attention to, that is what you will be nurturing and feeding and what will be growing in your lives. So if you desire to reap positive rewards and experiences you must sow positive seeds. You will never create a perfect and refined atmosphere within your own natures by sowing seeds of hatred or anger, by continuing to create these experiences.\"St. Germain, through Eric KleinThe Inner Door; Channeled Discourses from the Ascended Masters on Self-Mastery and AscensionVolume One",

The list includes not only their national rabbinical group but also names specifically the Union for Reform Judaism’s former president Eric Yoffie and David Saperstein, director of the group’s Religious Action Center, as individuals fighting for gun control laws.<br />\"<br /><br />-<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-politicians-join-chorus-calling-for-tighter-gun-laws/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>timesofisrael.com/jewish-politicians-join-cho<span class=\"invisible\">rus-calling-for-tighter-gun-laws/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://archive.vn/CKEVz\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>archive.vn/CKEVz<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />\"Jewish politicians lead chorus calling for tighter gun laws\"<br />16 December 2012<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/anti-semitic-fliers-blame-jewish-lawmakers-for-gun-control/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>timesofisrael.com/anti-semitic-fliers-blame-j<span class=\"invisible\">ewish-lawmakers-for-gun-control/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://archive.vn/xxlR6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>archive.vn/xxlR6<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />\"Anti-Semitic fliers blame US Jewish lawmakers for gun control\"<br />22 March 2018<br /><br />Musician Ted Nugent Calls Out The Jews Behind Gun Control<br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/BlackScorpionNationalists/posts/108486805336980919\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>gab.com/BlackScorpionNationalists/posts/10848<span class=\"invisible\">6805336980919<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230203191312/https://gab.com/BlackScorpionNationalists/posts/108486805336980919\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>web.archive.org/web/20230203191312/https://ga<span class=\"invisible\">b.com/BlackScorpionNationalists/posts/108486805336980919<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Philip N Cohen says:<br />\"Armed goyim are always bad news for us, duh\"<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/familyunequal/status/967604389706977281\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>twitter.com/familyunequal/status/967604389706<span class=\"invisible\">977281<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://archive.vn/joQo3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>archive.vn/joQo3<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/19/the-nra-will-fall-its-inevitable/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/<span class=\"invisible\">19/the-nra-will-fall-its-inevitable/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://archive.vn/jgcD4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>archive.vn/jgcD4<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />\"The NRA will fall.

I believe his quote was we don’t and will not allow that sort of behavior here in New York. REALLY! In the summer of 2020, there were widespread attacks on police, acts of vandalism, fires, and property burned and destroyed. It certainly could not be misconstrued as “peaceful protest”.And now the NYC Police are “gearing” up to keep the city safe because of President Trump. They should have “geared” in 2020 to protect businesses and citizens from BLM and Antifa.And...Based on the riots in 2016, they know what they should be able to get by with. Unless, of course, there is a two tier justice system.TOTAL HYPOCRISY.New York City does not tolerate violence. Yes, that’s Funny! The mayor and I’m assuming the police chief sound like Chicken Little AND the boy who cried wolf all wrapped up in one! What a joke! Calling out elected officials is so stoking the fire!And...Did he just say respect the rule of law! Said that with a straight face too. Criminals being released left and right! Again, their hypocrisy is showing BIG TIME!Where were these type of comments and standards from the left when the thugs were rioting and destroying the city? Give me a break!! We see right through all your evil intentions.Our country is becoming brainwashed to tyranny! Arresting a political rival just because you fear him is something a tyrant does. Unbelievable!Anyhow...Let me recap if these trumped up charges are about Stormy Daniels, Alvin Bragg has a few problems with his case.#1 It's two years past the statue of limitations meaning the case should be thrown out.#2 He is trying to turn a state charged misdemeanor into a federal felony, his court cannot run a trial on a federal crime only federal court can do that.#3 His star witness has lied in court before ..he has no credibility.#4 He hid evidence from the opposing side.#5 The misdemeanor has a statue of limitations of two years and he is five years past the statue of limitations on the misdemeanor.When the charge is dismissed, President Trump can sue the city of New York and D.A. office.Donald Trump not only beats these fabricated charges, this political persecution propels him to the White House in 2024. The American people are sick of the deep state going after anyone that threatens their reign of power. President Trump’s approval is already up 15 points this week alone!President Trump’s arrest is the deep state panicking badly. They’re desperately trying to get Trump supporters to be violent. And nobody showed up to their party. Trump supporters are peaceful. We have no reason to be violent like they want. We will just vote for him!That said...The unprecedented weaponization of our laws and institutions by the illegitimate OBiden administration should warrant a check and balance on the Manhattan DA office and the brandonian DOJ to make sure all our citizens are treated fairly and lawfully.Praying for you President Trump.
