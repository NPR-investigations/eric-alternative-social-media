            "description": "Christian Identity, also sometimes called Israel Identity, is the only true conservative Christianity. It is true because it seeks to maintain the understanding ‚Äì in accordance with Scripture - that the New Covenant was made only with those same people with whom the Old Covenant was made: the House (family) of Israel and the House (family) of Judah. These Israelite people are traceable through time to the Keltic and Germanic tribes of today. None of these people are Jews. The Jews are descended from a mere remnant of the old Kingdom of Judah along with assorted Edomite and other Arabs who were mixed into the Roman province of Judaea during the Hellenic period. Christian Identity is the belief that the Covenants of God are real and consistent. It professes that the people of the Old Testament were every bit as much Christian as the people of the New Testament. They were simply looking forward to the first advent of the Christ, while we today await His Second Advent. As the famous Christian bishop Ignatius said nineteen hundred years ago, Christianity did not come from Judaism: rather, Judaism is a perversion of Christianity. Christian Identity is therefore the original Christian Orthodoxy, and Christian Identity is the original catholic faith, in the true and original use of the word \"catholic\" by Christian writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.https://christogenea.org/articles/what-christian-identity",
