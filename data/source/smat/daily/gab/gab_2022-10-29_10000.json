Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Engelbrecht and Phillips had been investigating Konnech since January 2021, and last month, prior to Yu's arrest, the CEO filed a defamation lawsuit against them.The lawsuit has continued, despite Yu's arrest, and in Houston on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt gave Engelbrecht and Phillips a deadline of Monday to turn over any Konnech data it possessed and disclose the name of their source.True the Vote has characterized the lawsuit as an effort to try to silence the organization. Konnech obtained an ex-parte temporary restraining order in secret, True the Vote said, so the election integrity group would have no opportunity to contest it.Phillips, in a message on Truth Social, said he and Engelbrecht \"were held in contempt of court because we refused to burn a confidential informant or our researchers.\"\"We will go to jail Monday unless we comply.\"Last week, calling it \"probably the largest data breach in United States history,\" Los Angeles County prosecutor Eric Neff said Chinese contractors working for Konnech had direct control over U.S. election data through an app for poll workers called PollChief.The complaint cited as evidence a message from a Konnech project manager through a Chinese-owned messaging app that said \"any employee for Chinese contractors working on PollChief software had 'superadministration' privileges for all PollChief clients.\"Sam Faddis, former CIA officer, put that statement in perspective in a Substack post.https://www.wnd.com/2022/10/judge-threatens-2000-mules-investigators-jail/?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=wnd-breaking&amp;utm_campaign=breaking&amp;utm_content=breaking&amp;ats_es=f545c392787275e445d7bbb46d661826",

Konnech obtained an ex-parte temporary restraining order in secret, True the Vote said, so the election integrity group would have no opportunity to contest it.<br />Phillips, in a message on Truth Social, said he and Engelbrecht \"were held in contempt of court because we refused to burn a confidential informant or our researchers.\"<br />\"We will go to jail Monday unless we comply.\"<br />Last week, calling it \"probably the largest data breach in United States history,\" Los Angeles County prosecutor Eric Neff said Chinese contractors working for Konnech had direct control over U.S. election data through an app for poll workers called PollChief.<br />The complaint cited as evidence a message from a Konnech project manager through a Chinese-owned messaging app that said \"any employee for Chinese contractors working on PollChief software had 'superadministration' privileges for all PollChief clients.\"<br />Sam Faddis, former CIA officer, put that statement in perspective in a Substack post.<br /><a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/10/judge-threatens-2000-mules-investigators-jail/?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=wnd-breaking&amp;utm_campaign=breaking&amp;utm_content=breaking&amp;ats_es=f545c392787275e445d7bbb46d661826\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>wnd.com/2022/10/judge-threatens-2000-mules-in<span class=\"invisible\">vestigators-jail/?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=wnd-breaking&amp;utm_campaign=breaking&amp;utm_content=breaking&amp;ats_es=f545c392787275e445d7bbb46d661826<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

They cite Finnish media. Reportedly, a condition NATO placed on Finland to join NATO was that US nuclear missiles be placed on Finland's Russian border, which is closer to Moscow than all other borders except Ukraine, Eric Zuesse writes. .While the Ukrainian missiles would bombard Moscow in 5 minutes to preemptively decapitate the Russian retaliatory command, the Finnish missiles would reach it in 7 minutes – just 120 seconds before Russia can launch its retaliatory attacks. Finland must now vote on the bill to join NATO, on that basis (ie to become America's spearhead to defeat Russia in WWIII). It is clear (assuming NATO has indeed led Finnish leaders to believe that saying yes increases the chances of NATO speeding up Finland's application to join) that NATO wants to checkmate Russia if Finland joins.Newsweek also reports: “The US already has about 100 nuclear weapons in Europe, which are located in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Britain and France, both NATO members, also maintain their own independent nuclear arsenals.”None of these countries borders Russia. They are all much further away.During the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, JFK refused to allow the Soviet Union to place its missiles 1,820 km from Washington DC, warning that the US would start WWIII if they did; so the Soviet Union decided not to.The Finnish border extends as far as 815 km from Moscow, near the Finnish city of Kotka. The Ukrainian border is considerably closer: 510 km from Shostka to Moscow, and 568 km from Sumy to Moscow – this is the bordering country that would pose the greatest danger to Russia if it were to join NATO. Finland is second – only Ukraine is worse in the eyes of Russia.Russia invaded Ukraine in order to move that potential 510 km to at least the 1,820 km that everyone agreed in 1962 would be too close to Washington DC and therefore justified for America to start WWIII.The reason the difference between 510 km vs. 815 km is only about two minutes is that the slowest part of the flight is first, as it accelerates. Practically speaking, placing nuclear-weapon missiles 815 km from the Kremlin by Washington is much the same as placing them at the closest point to the border with Ukraine. One can already see that Russia is actively opposing this.In 1962, rockets were much slower than they are today. So to match Cuba's 1,820 km in 1962, Russia would have to keep US missiles about 3,200 km from the nearest US land-based nuclear missiles. The current situation is considerably more dangerous for Russia than the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 was for America.According to leading American scholars who specialize in assessing such matters, “America's recent nuclear weapons policy creates exactly what one would expect if a nuclear-armed state planned to have the capacity to wage nuclear war and win by disarming enemies. with an unexpected first strike” .Newsweek's Oct. 26 disclosure suggests that this is indeed what the US government intended and is: \"to wage and win a nuclear war by disarming enemies with a surprise attack.\" (That metastrategy is called “Nuclear Primacy”, and in America it replaced the “MAD” or Mutually Assured Destruction metastrategy around 2006 ).During WWII , Finland sided with the Nazis and participated with the Germans in their “Operation Barbarossa invasion of the Soviet Union” .
