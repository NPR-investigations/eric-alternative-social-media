Mo Brooks, now running for the U.S. Senate, revealed that a private investigator paid by Eric Swalwell entered his home without his permission and confronted his wife to serve Brooks with a lawsuit related to January 6. Brooks said that the entry was illegal, and slammed Swalwell for sending his team to his home.In a press release, Brooks’ officec now says “Tuesday, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Congressman Eric Swalwell teammate Christian Seklecki of Georgia for the Class A misdemeanor of 1st Degree Criminal Trespass. Christian Seklecki illegally entered Congressman Mo Brooks’ (AL-05) home and accosted his wife, Martha Brooks, on June 6, 2021. On June 7, Congressman Brooks released home surveillance video proving Seklecki stalked Martha Brooks and ran into the Brooks’ home without the Brooks’ knowledge or permission.”Brooks said, “Congressman Eric Swalwell lied in his politically motivated, meritless lawsuit against President Donald Trump and me when he falsely claimed I incited the January 6th Capitol violence. Swalwell’s attorneys lied again when they strutted in front of the news media like peacocks in heat and falsely accused me of avoiding Swalwell’s lawsuit service when the fact is they could have served me roughly a hundred times before, during or after both Swalwell and I voted together on the House floor, or served me by U.S. Mail to my home address.

Mo Brooks, now running for the U.S. Senate, revealed that a private investigator paid by Eric Swalwell entered his home without his permission and confronted his wife to serve Brooks with a lawsuit related to January 6. Brooks said that the entry was illegal, and slammed Swalwell for sending his team to his home.<br /><br />In a press release, Brooks’ officec now says “Tuesday, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Congressman Eric Swalwell teammate Christian Seklecki of Georgia for the Class A misdemeanor of 1st Degree Criminal Trespass. Christian Seklecki illegally entered Congressman Mo Brooks’ (AL-05) home and accosted his wife, Martha Brooks, on June 6, 2021. On June 7, Congressman Brooks released home surveillance video proving Seklecki stalked Martha Brooks and ran into the Brooks’ home without the Brooks’ knowledge or permission.”<br /><br />Brooks said, “Congressman Eric Swalwell lied in his politically motivated, meritless lawsuit against President Donald Trump and me when he falsely claimed I incited the January 6th Capitol violence. Swalwell’s attorneys lied again when they strutted in front of the news media like peacocks in heat and falsely accused me of avoiding Swalwell’s lawsuit service when the fact is they could have served me roughly a hundred times before, during or after both Swalwell and I voted together on the House floor, or served me by U.S. Mail to my home address. In fact, when they finally got serious about serving me with the lawsuit, they served me not once, not twice, but three times, all within one week! So much for avoiding service or being difficult to find!”",

Part of that report was that it was confirmed by the FBI that Swalwell did have a sexual relationship with Fang. That’s been suspected from the beginning given Fang’s typical tactics and the fact that Swalwell refused to deny the claim.Well, it looks like we’ve just gotten confirmation the FBI did indeed provide such a briefing. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has announced that he was indeed briefed and that nothing he heard was good.Speaker Pelosi and I were briefed together by the FBI for more than an hour about Eric Swalwell’s ties to a reported-Chinese spy.Anyone who heard what we both heard should never allow him to continue serving on the Intel Committee. http://pic.twitter.com/xEEopxT2CR— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) December 19, 2020I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say that McCarthy wouldn’t say this publicly if all the FBI told him is that Fang had some innocent contacts with Swalwell’s campaign. No, this seems to further point to the idea that there was a deeper relationship between the two, including the sexual relationship asserted via sources yesterday.Given that, what’s next? Does Nancy Pelosi really continue to defend Swalwell, or does she move to cut him loose sooner rather than later? This is only going to get worse. If Democrats think they can keep this under wraps, they are mistaken. The leaks have already started, and if Swalwell continues to lie to the public or obfuscate when answering questions, there will be more people who get fed up and start talking to the press. They won’t be talking to The New York Times, but things will get out.",

She became a bundler for his campaign in addition to other services performed. Swalwell let her place at least one intern in his congressional office; as a freshman, he was slotted onto the Science, Space, and Technology subcommittee of the House Homeland Security Committee where Democrat Bennie Thompson was ranking member at the time.In 2014, Swalwell was reelected. Now part of the new anti-American majority in the House, he moved over to serve under the sociopathic buddy of sexual predator and major Democrat donor Ed Buck, Adam Schiff. Schiff put him in charge of the oversight committee for the CIA.Sometime in 2015, Christine Fang decamped for China. Swalwell claims the FBI gave him a protective briefing on their suspicions that she was a Chinese agent and that he either cut ties with her or he continued to help the FBI in its inquiries. Swalwell seems a little confused. Strangely, both his father and brother continued to “friend” Fang on Facebook. Now, Facebook is blocked by the Chinese government. You can access it by breaking the law and using ways to circumvent the blockage…or, if you are a Chinese spook, you will get professional assistance in being visible on Facebook. Why would the father and brother be Facebook friends with the woman their brother/son was humping? Your guess is as good as mine, but any series of guesses has to include the high probability that Swalwell remained in contact with her via their Facebook accounts.",

They didn’t even take his money. $52.”<br /><br />“You don’t say! Is that why some 320,000 residents fled NY state between July 2020 and July 2021, according to US Census Bureau data. That makes New York the nation’s leading state for population decline. Guess where they went…FL and TX!”<br /><br />“weird way to announce that you’re raising rents by the highest percentage in decades, but ok, Slum Lord” <br /><br />“I’m in Miami and you couldn’t pay me to live in your city, Eric.”<br /><br />“Then why are so many New Yorkers fleeing to Florida?”<br /><br />“There’s a third type… the people who know that New York is a crime ridden shithole and never want to step foot there again.”<br /><br />“gonna take a lot of work to get NY back to where it used to be. Adams lot of people were hopeful for you, but you are off to a rough start buddy and tweets like this are just arrogant and clueless” <br /><br />“No thank you. I’m very happy where I am.”",

Towards the end of the interview, Jake Tapper asked about his past contact with an alleged Chinese spy.You may remember that last month, Axios dropped a pretty stunning report about suspected Chinese spy Christine Fang (also known as Fang Fang) targeting a number of U.S. politicians, including Swalwell.At the time, Swalwell’s office told Axios, “Rep. Swalwell, long ago, provided information about this person - whom he met more than eight years ago, and whom he hasn’t seen in nearly six years - to the FBI. To protect information that might be classified, he will not participate in your story.”…Tapper brought that up Monday and asked Swalwell, “Have you learned any more about this case since this broke in early December? And can you clarify how much contact you had with this Chinese national?”Swalwell responded, “The FBI has said that I did nothing wrong. Don’t take it from me. There was no wrongdoing. I’ve learned nothing new. And Speaker Pelosi has said she is keeping me on the committee. By the way, Jake, Republicans were briefed on this conduct, that this individual was trying to do with me and many other members of congress, back in 2015. I think this is retaliation more than anything else.”",

One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.)Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, The Word is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).A “cult” is deemed so since it claims to have faith in Jesus but it fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There’s also ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. (Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Eric von Anderseck of the Second Eighth Week Apostles (S8W), Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism and so on.)By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything” (“THE GOSPEL ONLY”, in other words – Keyword “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born the new way” – John 3:1-21) is only qualified to teach the new covenant (study 2 Corinthians 3:4-11).

HUMONGOUS difference.)<br />Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information).

Eric Swalwell (R-CA) off of the House Intelligence Committee.The House voted 218-200 Thursday night to table or kill the resolution.nThere were three Republicans who voted present, Michael Guest (R-MS), Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), and David Joyce (R-OH).Last week Breitbart News reported, after Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) reappointed Swalwell to the Intelligence Committee, McCarthy was going to put forth a resolution to force Swalwell off his Intelligence Committee assignment. This came after a report alleged Swalwell had a relationship with a Chinese spy.This was another attempt by the Minority Leader to hold Swalwell accountable for the reported ties between him and Chinese national Christine Fang.The resolution McCarthy authored noted Swalwell “has not denied public reporting that a suspected Chinese intelligence operative helped raise money for Representative Swalwell’s political campaigns and facilitated the potential assignment of interns into Representative Swalwell’s offices.”The previous report from Axios in December revealed a years-long political intelligence operation run by China’s main civilian spy agency between 2011 and 2015. It showed a suspected Chinese spy developed extensive ties with Swalwell. The Chinese national named “Fang Fang” or “Christine Fang” targeted “up-and-coming local politicians in the Bay Area and across the country who had the potential to make it big on the national stage.”According to Axios, Fang even fundraised for Swalwell and placed at least one intern in his office:Fang took part in fundraising activity for Swalwell’s 2014 re-election campaign, according to a Bay Area political operative and a current U.S. intelligence official. Swalwell’s office was directly aware of these activities on its behalf, the political operative said. That same political operative, who witnessed Fang fundraising on Swalwell’s behalf, found no evidence of illegal contributions.Federal Election Commission records don’t indicate Fang herself made donations, which are prohibited from foreign nationals. Fang helped place at least one intern in Swalwell’s office, according to those same two people, and interacted with Swalwell at multiple events over the course of several years.",

And they had so much trouble with the other nations there, who finally succeeded in driving them out of Asia, across the border, into what is known today as Russia, in the area of the Ukraine. They found, there, a lot of peaceful agricultural people, mostly Slavic, and they conquered them. They did the same thing then as they are still doing in the Middle East! They took them, for no reason at all, except the people weren't trained to fight! They established there, the Khazar Kingdom. Now, those three pages in that Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. 15, the 1911 Edition tells you who they are, how war-like, how savage, how barbarian they are, and that they succeeded in sweeping across Europe to the gates of Paris, and to Finland. They controlled all Europe - these Mongols known as Khazars! They did that from maybe the fourth century to the ninth century. And they were the most brutal people. They enslaved these people and exacted tribute from them, while holding them under their control - practically all Europe. Until in the 8th century, a man by the name of Rurik. a Varengian, who came from across the water, from what is known today as Sweden, - he organized these people. They were living as people interested in agriculture. They didn't want any politics, they didn't want nations or governments. But he saw what they were subject to, this treatment by their Khazar conquerors. And he organized the principality of Rokh, which became the Russian Empire. He organized them, and started to drive these Khazars back. And he finally succeeded to where they came into Europe for the first time, in the area of the Ukraine, where they continued their Khazar Kingdom. Now, they were Phallic Worshipers. Anyone who doesn't know what Phallic worship means, I am not going to go into detail, but they were Phallic worshipers and they were so degenerate that when the king, their ruler, heard that there were such things as monotheistic forms of religious belief, (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) he sent for representatives of the three of them, and asked them to tell him the merits of their faith. And after listening to them, like a child would play \"Eenie, Meenie, Minie, Mo\" to pick out the one that they favored, he listened to the three of them, and said, \"I'm going to become a Jew and adopt the religion known today as Judaism.\" http://www.hugequestions.com/Eric/TFC/Freedman1974speech.html",
