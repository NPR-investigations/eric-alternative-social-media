Greg Abbott’s (R) program busing migrants to New York City is “hateful politics” that is “taking away the respect and dignity of people who are in need” and “just so anti-American.” And said that Abbott should talk to the mayors in the cities and governors in the states that the buses have to pass through in order to get to New York and figure out “how do we do this together?” Unbelievable! The party that began busing black ppl to “integrate” schools says that busing is Un-American!

Greg Abbott’s (R) program busing migrants to New York City is “hateful politics” that is “taking away the respect and dignity of people who are in need” and “just so anti-American.” And said that Abbott should talk to the mayors in the cities and governors in the states that the buses have to pass through in order to get to New York and figure out “how do we do this together?” Unbelievable! The party that began busing black ppl to “integrate” schools says that busing is Un-American!

            "description": "This group is based on \"Historical Revisionism\" so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal.

Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here. We can never have too many backup groups.

All the Nazi groups are socialist, the \"white Protection league\" is run by a fucking kike, and the \"Politically Incorrect,\" group is politically correct. Leftism is the denial and projection of denial and projection.I will troll all enemies of the white race into submission. White Power means I am not obligated to let migrants live in a tent on my front lawn and a kike on the couch in my livingroom. Build your own lives, stop leeching off mine like a bunch of parasites.Access to Whites is not a right; it is a matter of our own volition, a priviledge that We have the right to withdraw at any time, for whatever reason we deem fit.\"as Judeo-Christians, we should let the Jews who killed Christ run our governments because that's what the bible says.\" - Moron Fake Christians\"Having thoughts and opinions is bigoted\" - leftists\"we need to erase the speech and thoughts some people have to stop all the bigotry.\" - #BigtechThe Left = The Jews and their useful idiots. Notice how the Left bitches about Whites all day long, but when whites say \"Ok, fine, lets live in separate states,\" they then say that that notion is somehow the most evil, racist thing ever. They don't have the intellectual capacity or consistency to say... \"ok, let's just go our separate ways\" because they know they are pathetic, dumb, lazy cunts that are utterly dependent on us to stay alive.For now on, the first two screener questions you should ask a #Republican candidate are: 1. Do you love the Jews?2. Should men have sex with men?A yes to either is a no-go.I like to call leftist ideology \"Intersectional Communism\", because that's what it is.Communism is a publically known and announced Jewish world takeover conspiracy plot that has already killed hundreds of millions of people, but if you say so, you're anti-semetic, even though Jews are less than half semetic. Arabs are semetic. To kikes, a statement of the publically known _truth_ is \"hate speech\".Enemies of mankind...",

Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.&nbsp;On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’&nbsp;But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’”2 TIMOTHY 3:5 (NLT)They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!https://www.biblegateway.com/Biblical description of cults, right there.A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information).

Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.&nbsp;On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’&nbsp;But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’”<br />2 TIMOTHY 3:5 (NLT)<br />They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly.

They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.<br /><br />An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).",

And that is likely an over-estimate because today all early treatment protocols are suppressed worldwide.I still haven’t heard of a single case where anyone under 19 who was healthy got COVID and died from COVID. Have you ever heard of such a case?I have looked at the death records in Massachusetts and couldn’t find such a case.In other words, for kids, there’s no emergency. There’s not even a PROBLEM here for kids!John Ioannidis just came out with a paper on October 13, 2022 saying that the median IFR is 0.0003% for kids 0 to 19.    What that means is that in the event your child does get COVID, the chance your child will die is 3 in a million.But it’s likely much less than even that number if your child takes a few drugs and supplements to further minimize the risk like I did. My treatment profile had ZERO side effects, and I had no long haul COVID symptoms and recovered very quickly.In fact, just a simple saline nasal rinse done twice a day after infection reduces your risk of hospitalization by a factor of 8. Here’s the conclusion of the paper cited in that article:    SARS-CoV-2+ participants initiating nasal irrigation were over 8 times less likely to be hospitalized than the national rate.So in light of virtually zero risk for kids, why would anyone get vaccinated with a vaccine which causes measurable cardiac injury in nearly 30% of the kids who get it?Answer: Only someone who was misinformed by government/mainstream media propaganda would do this.Why would the ACIP committee approve these vaccines for the childhood vaccination schedule?The Ioannidis paper had already been available at the time of the vote. The Thailand paper has been out for a longer time and is well known.The only reason for approving a vaccine which causes more harm than good is … ? Well I don’t know.Here’s one of the public comments that was submitted to the ACIP committee.I saved this brilliant, compassionate comment I read on the governmental regulations' site yesterday:    I am Dr. Sheila Furey. I have been practicing medicine for over 25 years. I am seeing COVID vaccine injured patients every day in my practice. I have never seen this rate of disease.    The patients were all medically stable prior to their COVID shots. After their shots, all of them became ill from COVID and required treatment. Many continue to suffer from fatigue, weakness and brain fog. One patient's cancer is aggressive and is not responding to chemotherapy as anticipated. They are 40 years old.    Please stop the COVID shots and do not expose our children to these genetic experiments. The lipid nanoparticle does not stay in the arm. Children and young people are dying at alarming rates. These are primarily cardiac injuries, but over 1,200 serious injuries are seen on VAERS.    COVID is a treatable illness and we must stop sacrificing our children and young people to this deadly injection.I’m sure none of the committee members reads any of the public comments.Doctors on the ground are seeing that the vaccine is causing enormous harm. It’s not even a close call.NEJM Editor and Harvard Professor Dr. Eric RubinRubin, who is an advisor to the FDA, said, “But we’re never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it. That’s just the way it goes.”That was October 26, 2021, nearly one year ago!Well, OK, we’ve been giving it and we now know how dangerous it is.So Eric, now that we know the IFR is so low and the rate of cardiac injury is so high, will you be calling for a halt for the vaccines for kids?Of course he won’t. That would save lives, but it would end his career in medicine. It’s never going to happen. And that’s the problem.The numbers clearly show that the ACIP committee should be disbanded and reconstituted with people who understand simple risk benefit analyses. It’s clear that none of the people on the committee have the basic math skills required.https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/ioannidis-the-median-ifr-for-kids?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email",

          "content": "The median IFR for kids is just 0.0003%If your kid gets COVID, the risk is 3 in 1 million that your child will die from COVID. And that is likely an over-estimate because today all early treatment protocols are suppressed worldwide.I still haven’t heard of a single case where anyone under 19 who was healthy got COVID and died from COVID. Have you ever heard of such a case?I have looked at the death records in Massachusetts and couldn’t find such a case.In other words, for kids, there’s no emergency. There’s not even a PROBLEM here for kids!John Ioannidis just came out with a paper on October 13, 2022 saying that the median IFR is 0.0003% for kids 0 to 19.    What that means is that in the event your child does get COVID, the chance your child will die is 3 in a million.But it’s likely much less than even that number if your child takes a few drugs and supplements to further minimize the risk like I did. My treatment profile had ZERO side effects, and I had no long haul COVID symptoms and recovered very quickly.In fact, just a simple saline nasal rinse done twice a day after infection reduces your risk of hospitalization by a factor of 8. Here’s the conclusion of the paper cited in that article:    SARS-CoV-2+ participants initiating nasal irrigation were over 8 times less likely to be hospitalized than the national rate.So in light of virtually zero risk for kids, why would anyone get vaccinated with a vaccine which causes measurable cardiac injury in nearly 30% of the kids who get it?Answer: Only someone who was misinformed by government/mainstream media propaganda would do this.Why would the ACIP committee approve these vaccines for the childhood vaccination schedule?The Ioannidis paper had already been available at the time of the vote. The Thailand paper has been out for a longer time and is well known.The only reason for approving a vaccine which causes more harm than good is … ? Well I don’t know.Here’s one of the public comments that was submitted to the ACIP committee.I saved this brilliant, compassionate comment I read on the governmental regulations' site yesterday:    I am Dr. Sheila Furey. I have been practicing medicine for over 25 years. I am seeing COVID vaccine injured patients every day in my practice. I have never seen this rate of disease.    The patients were all medically stable prior to their COVID shots. After their shots, all of them became ill from COVID and required treatment. Many continue to suffer from fatigue, weakness and brain fog. One patient's cancer is aggressive and is not responding to chemotherapy as anticipated. They are 40 years old.    Please stop the COVID shots and do not expose our children to these genetic experiments. The lipid nanoparticle does not stay in the arm. Children and young people are dying at alarming rates. These are primarily cardiac injuries, but over 1,200 serious injuries are seen on VAERS.    COVID is a treatable illness and we must stop sacrificing our children and young people to this deadly injection.I’m sure none of the committee members reads any of the public comments.Doctors on the ground are seeing that the vaccine is causing enormous harm. It’s not even a close call.NEJM Editor and Harvard Professor Dr. Eric RubinRubin, who is an advisor to the FDA, said, “But we’re never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it. That’s just the way it goes.”That was October 26, 2021, nearly one year ago!Well, OK, we’ve been giving it and we now know how dangerous it is.So Eric, now that we know the IFR is so low and the rate of cardiac injury is so high, will you be calling for a halt for the vaccines for kids?Of course he won’t. That would save lives, but it would end his career in medicine. It’s never going to happen. And that’s the problem.The numbers clearly show that the ACIP committee should be disbanded and reconstituted with people who understand simple risk benefit analyses. It’s clear that none of the people on the committee have the basic math skills required.https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/ioannidis-the-median-ifr-for-kids?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email",

Here’s the conclusion of the paper cited in that article:    SARS-CoV-2+ participants initiating nasal irrigation were over 8 times less likely to be hospitalized than the national rate.So in light of virtually zero risk for kids, why would anyone get vaccinated with a vaccine which causes measurable cardiac injury in nearly 30% of the kids who get it?Answer: Only someone who was misinformed by government/mainstream media propaganda would do this.Why would the ACIP committee approve these vaccines for the childhood vaccination schedule?The Ioannidis paper had already been available at the time of the vote. The Thailand paper has been out for a longer time and is well known.The only reason for approving a vaccine which causes more harm than good is … ? Well I don’t know.Here’s one of the public comments that was submitted to the ACIP committee.I saved this brilliant, compassionate comment I read on the governmental regulations' site yesterday:    I am Dr. Sheila Furey. I have been practicing medicine for over 25 years. I am seeing COVID vaccine injured patients every day in my practice. I have never seen this rate of disease.    The patients were all medically stable prior to their COVID shots. After their shots, all of them became ill from COVID and required treatment. Many continue to suffer from fatigue, weakness and brain fog. One patient's cancer is aggressive and is not responding to chemotherapy as anticipated. They are 40 years old.    Please stop the COVID shots and do not expose our children to these genetic experiments. The lipid nanoparticle does not stay in the arm. Children and young people are dying at alarming rates. These are primarily cardiac injuries, but over 1,200 serious injuries are seen on VAERS.    COVID is a treatable illness and we must stop sacrificing our children and young people to this deadly injection.I’m sure none of the committee members reads any of the public comments.Doctors on the ground are seeing that the vaccine is causing enormous harm. It’s not even a close call.NEJM Editor and Harvard Professor Dr. Eric RubinRubin, who is an advisor to the FDA, said, “But we’re never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it. That’s just the way it goes.”That was October 26, 2021, nearly one year ago!Well, OK, we’ve been giving it and we now know how dangerous it is.So Eric, now that we know the IFR is so low and the rate of cardiac injury is so high, will you be calling for a halt for the vaccines for kids?Of course he won’t. That would save lives, but it would end his career in medicine. It’s never going to happen. And that’s the problem.The numbers clearly show that the ACIP committee should be disbanded and reconstituted with people who understand simple risk benefit analyses. It’s clear that none of the people on the committee have the basic math skills required.https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/ioannidis-the-median-ifr-for-kids?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email",
          "contentraw": "The median IFR for kids is just 0.0003%<br /><br />If your kid gets COVID, the risk is 3 in 1 million that your child will die from COVID. And that is likely an over-estimate because today all early treatment protocols are suppressed worldwide.<br /><br />I still haven’t heard of a single case where anyone under 19 who was healthy got COVID and died from COVID. Have you ever heard of such a case?<br /><br />I have looked at the death records in Massachusetts and couldn’t find such a case.<br /><br />In other words, for kids, there’s no emergency.

Worse, companies and governments are rated according to reflect ESG “worthiness.” ⁃ TN EditorNineteen Republican attorneys general announced an investigation into six Wall Street firms regarding their involvement with the United Nations Net-Zero Banking Alliance.The nineteen attorneys general served Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo with civil investigative demands, which reportedly act as a subpoena, asking for documents relating to the companies’ involvement with the United Nations (UN) Net-Zero Banking Alliance.Members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance must set emission reduction targets in their lending and investment portfolios to reach net zero by 2050.Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt have led the effort to investigate these financial conglomerates.Schmitt said in a statement on Monday:The Net-Zero Banking Alliance is a massive worldwide agreement by major banking institutions, overseen by the U.N., to starve companies engaged in fossil fuel-related activities of credit on national and international markets. Missouri farmers, oil leasing companies, and other businesses that are vital to Missouri’s and America’s economy will be unable to get a loan because of this alliance.

If Doughty agrees, the depositions would take place during a 30-day window.Doughty already agreed to the plaintiffs’ request to expedite discovery. That led to the production of hundreds of pages of documents, which bolstered plaintiff claims of Big Tech–government collusion.In that order, Doughty said plaintiffs could alert defendants to any depositions plaintiffs wished to take, and that the parties would then meet to confer on any deposition requests.If the parties didn’t agree on the depositions, a joint statement would be submitted to outline their differences.Doughty has seven days to rule on the new filing, which included objections from the government.Department of Justice lawyers said that plaintiffs usually take no more than 10 depositions during normal discovery, and taking that many during expedited discovery would be too burdensome.“Although a plaintiff is rarely entitled to expedited discovery, Plaintiffs here have received a substantial amount. Defendants produced more than 15,000 pages of non-privileged responsive e-mails, and they answered numerous interrogatories. Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that still more discovery—particularly burdensome depositions—is warranted at this stage of the case,” they said.[Click on my replies below for rest of article]https://www.theepochtimes.com/states-seek-to-depose-fauci-other-top-officials-in-big-tech-government-censorship-case_4799980.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",

And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant your tax dollars will be used to help him through his pregnancy and abortion so he can feel he is normal by invoking his right to kill his child because he is a woman! Every man who believes he is a woman has a right to an abortion! Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution.

They believe that a woman has the right to kill her child.  And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant your tax dollars will be used to help him through his pregnancy and abortion so he can feel he is normal by invoking his right to kill his child because he is a woman! Every man who believes he is a woman has a right to an abortion! Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution. Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan.

Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

They believe that a woman has the right to kill her child.  And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant your tax dollars will be used to help him through his pregnancy and abortion so he can feel he is normal by invoking his right to kill his child because he is a woman! Every man who believes he is a woman has a right to an abortion! Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution.

It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant your tax dollars will be used to help him through his pregnancy and abortion so he can feel he is normal by invoking his right to kill his child because he is a woman! Every man who believes he is a woman has a right to an abortion! Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution.

It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant your tax dollars will be used to help him through his pregnancy and abortion so he can feel he is normal by invoking his right to kill his child because he is a woman! Every man who believes he is a woman has a right to an abortion! Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution.

And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant your tax dollars will be used to help him through his pregnancy and abortion so he can feel he is normal by invoking his right to kill his child because he is a woman! Every man who believes he is a woman has a right to an abortion! Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution.
