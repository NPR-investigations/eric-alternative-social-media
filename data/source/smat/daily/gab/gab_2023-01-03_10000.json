          "content": "Los militares Sombreros Blancos atacan en Venezuela al barco del FEMA que trat√≥ de tomar la base de Guant√°namo. En una nueva cr√≥nica que sigue a la referida sobre el intento de invasi√≥n de la base de Guant√°namo por fuerzas del FEMA el pasado d√≠a de Navidad, Real Raw News explica que el comandante saliente de los militares Sombreros Blancos (General Berger) se reuni√≥ con el entrante (General Smith) el d√≠a 26 de diciembre para discutir la represalia del ej√©rcito de los Estados Unidos a ese ataque.Mientras la propuesta del nuevo comandante consisti√≥ en enviar dos destructores Arleigh Burke para que destruyeran con misiles el barco del que parti√≥ el ataque, el General Berger disinti√≥, argumentando que ese tipo de ataque atraer√≠a la atenci√≥n de la comunidad internacional y provocar√≠a una crisis, ya que el buque estaba atracado en un puerto venezolano, am√©n de que podr√≠a causar la muerte a personas inocentes. Por ello, recomend√≥ una acci√≥n m√°s moderada y espec√≠fica y, ya que √©l estaba al mando todav√≠a, se puso en marcha su plan, que concibi√≥ junto al Almirante Eric T. Olson, Comandante de las Fuerzas Especiales* el d√≠a 27 de diciembre. Ambos estuvieron de acuerdo en que los Navy Seals eran los m√°s indicados para realizar esa operaci√≥n, dado que el barco estaba varado a un kil√≥metro de Puerto Cabello. Ese mismo d√≠a 27 de diciembre dos unidades de los Navy Seals, compuestas de 32 hombres en total, llegaron a la ciudad venezolana de Valencia, al sur de Puerto Cabello y se mezclaron con la poblaci√≥n. Seg√∫n relata la cr√≥nica, repartieron \"propinas\" entre la poblaci√≥n hasta enterarse de que hab√≠a unos norteamericanos regentando bares y restaurantes en la zona. Algunos de estos yanquis, ya borrachos, les contaron que trabajaban en un buque de guerra norteamericano que reposaba en las aguas de Puerto Cabello.De esas conversaciones dedujeron que la mayor parte de la tripulaci√≥n del barco, o bien estaban en tierra, o bien se hab√≠an escondido en otros lugares de Venezuela o hab√≠an vuelto a Estados Unidos.Siempre seg√∫n esta concisa pero precisa cr√≥nica, en la ma√±ana del d√≠a de A√±o Nuevo, los Navy Seals, utilizando unas embarcaciones submarinas, se infiltraron en el barco, donde r√°pidamente mataron a 12 agentes del FEMA que estaban en cubierta, posteriormente tomaron el control del puesto de mando y acto seguido, mataron a otros 27 agentes del FEMA, antes de colocar explosivos en la sala de motores. Tambi√©n sabotearon la artiller√≠a del barco y colocaron explosivos en los dos helic√≥pteros Stallion y los dos aviones AV8-8 Harriers que estaban en la pista de despegue, disparando a 6 agentes del FEMA m√°s y a 5 soldados traidores de la Marina, dentro de una persecuci√≥n. Siempre seg√∫n la fuente de Real Raw News, ning√∫n Navy Seal fue asesinado ni herido en la incursi√≥n.Una vez a salvo, los Seals explotaron a control remoto los explosivos, inutilizando as√≠ los motores y las armas del barco, de manera que no pueda volver a realizar ninguna acci√≥n contra los Sombreros Blancos. \"Le hemos enviado un claro mensaje al Deep State: si nos confront√°is, vais a sufrir las consecuencias\", acaba la cr√≥nica.*Esta cr√≥nica est√° repleta de implicaciones. La primera, que sorprende la rapidez en la que se constituy√≥ el operativo, hasta el punto en que uno se pregunta si los Navy Seals no estaban ya en Venezuela. La segunda, que el pa√≠s caribe√±o se convierte en un objetivo prioritario para los Sombreros Blancos. La tercera, que, a tenor de la pronta respuesta, a la actual jefa del FEMA, Deane Criswell, le quedan pocos d√≠as de vida. Por √∫ltimo, recuerdo que el ex secretario de defensa de Trump, Chris Miller, era el comandante en jefe de las Fuerzas Especiales. https://realrawnews.com/2023/01/white-hats-disable-amphibious-cruiser-that-attacked-gitmo/",
          "contentraw": "Los militares Sombreros Blancos atacan en Venezuela al barco del FEMA que trat√≥ de tomar la base de Guant√°namo. En una nueva cr√≥nica que sigue a la referida sobre el intento de invasi√≥n de la base de Guant√°namo por fuerzas del FEMA el pasado d√≠a de Navidad, Real Raw News explica que el comandante saliente de los militares Sombreros Blancos (General Berger) se reuni√≥ con el entrante (General Smith) el d√≠a 26 de diciembre para discutir la represalia del ej√©rcito de los Estados Unidos a ese ataque.<br />Mientras la propuesta del nuevo comandante consisti√≥ en enviar dos destructores Arleigh Burke para que destruyeran con misiles el barco del que parti√≥ el ataque, el General Berger disinti√≥, argumentando que ese tipo de ataque atraer√≠a la atenci√≥n de la comunidad internacional y provocar√≠a una crisis, ya que el buque estaba atracado en un puerto venezolano, am√©n de que podr√≠a causar la muerte a personas inocentes. Por ello, recomend√≥ una acci√≥n m√°s moderada y espec√≠fica y, ya que √©l estaba al mando todav√≠a, se puso en marcha su plan, que concibi√≥ junto al Almirante Eric T. Olson, Comandante de las Fuerzas Especiales* el d√≠a 27 de diciembre. Ambos estuvieron de acuerdo en que los Navy Seals eran los m√°s indicados para realizar esa operaci√≥n, dado que el barco estaba varado a un kil√≥metro de Puerto Cabello. Ese mismo d√≠a 27 de diciembre dos unidades de los Navy Seals, compuestas de 32 hombres en total, llegaron a la ciudad venezolana de Valencia, al sur de Puerto Cabello y se mezclaron con la poblaci√≥n. Seg√∫n relata la cr√≥nica, repartieron \"propinas\" entre la poblaci√≥n hasta enterarse de que hab√≠a unos norteamericanos regentando bares y restaurantes en la zona. Algunos de estos yanquis, ya borrachos, les contaron que trabajaban en un buque de guerra norteamericano que reposaba en las aguas de Puerto Cabello.<br />De esas conversaciones dedujeron que la mayor parte de la tripulaci√≥n del barco, o bien estaban en tierra, o bien se hab√≠an escondido en otros lugares de Venezuela o hab√≠an vuelto a Estados Unidos.<br />Siempre seg√∫n esta concisa pero precisa cr√≥nica, en la ma√±ana del d√≠a de A√±o Nuevo, los Navy Seals, utilizando unas embarcaciones submarinas, se infiltraron en el barco, donde r√°pidamente mataron a 12 agentes del FEMA que estaban en cubierta, posteriormente tomaron el control del puesto de mando y acto seguido, mataron a otros 27 agentes del FEMA, antes de colocar explosivos en la sala de motores. Tambi√©n sabotearon la artiller√≠a del barco y colocaron explosivos en los dos helic√≥pteros Stallion y los dos aviones AV8-8 Harriers que estaban en la pista de despegue, disparando a 6 agentes del FEMA m√°s y a 5 soldados traidores de la Marina, dentro de una persecuci√≥n. Siempre seg√∫n la fuente de Real Raw News, ning√∫n Navy Seal fue asesinado ni herido en la incursi√≥n.<br />Una vez a salvo, los Seals explotaron a control remoto los explosivos, inutilizando as√≠ los motores y las armas del barco, de manera que no pueda volver a realizar ninguna acci√≥n contra los Sombreros Blancos. <br />\"Le hemos enviado un claro mensaje al Deep State: si nos confront√°is, vais a sufrir las consecuencias\", acaba la cr√≥nica.<br />*Esta cr√≥nica est√° repleta de implicaciones. La primera, que sorprende la rapidez en la que se constituy√≥ el operativo, hasta el punto en que uno se pregunta si los Navy Seals no estaban ya en Venezuela. La segunda, que el pa√≠s caribe√±o se convierte en un objetivo prioritario para los Sombreros Blancos. La tercera, que, a tenor de la pronta respuesta, a la actual jefa del FEMA, Deane Criswell, le quedan pocos d√≠as de vida. Por √∫ltimo, recuerdo que el ex secretario de defensa de Trump, Chris Miller, era el comandante en jefe de las Fuerzas Especiales. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://realrawnews.com/2023/01/white-hats-disable-amphibious-cruiser-that-attacked-gitmo/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>realrawnews.com/2023/01/white-hats-disable-am<span class=\"invisible\">phibious-cruiser-that-attacked-gitmo/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
