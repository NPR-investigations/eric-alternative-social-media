No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you‚Äôll want to be sure you‚Äôre posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed.

Cochise voted straight Republican on November 8th, supporting gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters, while Luzerne County voted for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Shapiro and Republican Senate nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz.The vote in Cochise County delays the certification of over 47,000 votes, which is far greater than the margin by which Lake allegedly lost to Democratic nominee and incumbent Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. The decision was made after Supervisor Tom Crosby motioned to table the certification resolution until Friday, with Supervisor Peggy Judd seconding his motion.‚ÄúThis meeting agenda should have provided for interaction between subject matter experts on voter machines and representatives of the secretary of state‚Äôs office,‚Äù said Crosby, referring to numerous technical issues that suspiciously arise on Election Day throughout Arizona, which led to hours of delay and the possible disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters.In Luzerne County, two Republican officials voted against certification, with two Democrats voting in favor and a third Democrat abstaining. Luzerne had its own problems on Election Day, with multiple polling places running out of paper ballots; the difficulties led to the resignation of the Luzerne County manager the following day.‚ÄúThere have been enough irregularities and enough discrepancies and enough disenfranchisement of disenfranchised voters in this county that I don‚Äôt understand how we could possibly proceed without seriously considering a re-vote,‚Äù said James Magna, Vice Chair of the Board of Elections.The votes have raised further awareness to the issue of voter fraud and potentially illegal election practices in the United States, a trend that first started in 2020 and continued into the midterms. Democrats, however, have dismissed such claims despite overwhelming evidence, and far-left lawyers such as Marc Elias have already threatened legal action against the two counties, and any other jurisdictions that question the results of the election.",

Among his many public and private statements, he wrote in a Feb. 5, 2020, email that ‚Äúthe typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material.‚Äù About two months later, Fauci and other top officials reversed course and issued widespread masking recommendations, regardless of symptoms.Asked about the change while under oath on Nov. 23, Fauci couldn‚Äôt provide any studies, according to lawyers representing plaintiffs in a case against the federal government.‚ÄúHe was asked what studies or study changed his mind in that interim, which is what he claimed‚Äîhe claimed that it was studied. He couldn‚Äôt name any,‚Äù Jenin Younes, one of the lawyers, told The Epoch Times.Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican who was also present during the deposition in Maryland, said on social media that Fauci ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt cite a single study‚Äù to back up his claim that masks were effective against COVID-19.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made the change in masking advice on April 3, 2020, leading to widespread mask mandates. Officials, including then-CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, said studies indicating asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 led to the change. They cited zero studies on mask effectiveness. Many studies on masks don‚Äôt support their usage, including a CDC study widely cited by top officials, researchers have found.During an appearance that day on PBS, Fauci promoted the change, saying it was based on data regarding asymptomatic transmission.Fauci hasn‚Äôt appeared to cite any studies since in his repeated calls for people to wear a mask.Zuckerberg InterviewFauci told Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in an interview in mid-2020 that the original recommendation to not wear a mask was because of mask shortages.‚ÄúTwo things happened. One, it became clear that we had enough of the equipment, so there was no shortage. It became clear that cloth coverings‚Äîthat you didn‚Äôt have to buy in a store, that you could make yourself‚Äîwere adequate. And third‚Äîand probably the most compelling thing‚Äîis when it became very clear that anywhere from 20 to 45 percent of people who were infected, didn‚Äôt have any symptoms,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúSo the risk of your being in contact with someone who said, ‚ÄòWell, you look good, I look good, we‚Äôre not infected‚Äô was not the case, that you could be spreading it asymptomatically. You put all of those things together, which had us evolve from saying maybe we should hold off on masks because we needed them for the health care workers to saying now everybody should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside and should be trying to distance. That‚Äôs one example of evolving as you get more data and you get more information.‚ÄùFauci and NIAID didn‚Äôt respond to requests by The Epoch Times for comment on the deposition.The questioning took place on orders from the U.S. judge overseeing the case, which Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, another Republican, brought against the federal government and a slew of officials for allegedly colluding with Big Tech firms to illegally censor users.Fauci wasn‚Äôt asked about the deposition during interviews that aired on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù and NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù on Nov. 27.A transcript of the deposition is expected to be made public at a later date.FBI official Elvis Chan and former White House press secretary Jen Psaki are scheduled to be deposed next in the case.Made Court Reporter Wear MaskFauci sat for the deposition at the headquarters of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland.

The questioning lasted for about seven hours.Fauci didn‚Äôt wear a mask and neither did anybody else when the deposition started, Younes, a lawyer with the New Civil Liberties Alliance, told The Epoch Times.The woman transcribing the questioning, the court reporter, was sniffling.
