We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs.<\/p><p>All of our oceans and lakes do actually survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth, only Earth quakes. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored.<\/p><p>Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it&#39;s an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The &quot;Antarctic Treaty&quot; prohibits all private research, why do they hide Antarctica from us . . the lands beyond ?<\/p><p>This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language).

We think this firefighter's action was ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE.By doing so he spoke for and represented the American people better than ALL of congress combined has of recently.Be it known that we the people want this brave firefighter AWARDED THE HIGHEST achievement award and medal that the Fire department AND city has to offer.Joe Biden is not recognized by roughly a hundred million Americans as President and vaccine mandates are coercion and not lawful. In fact, Biden is recognized as a Chinese Marxist spokesperson because of the stolen 2020 election by foreign and domestic terrorists. Therefore, ending this Marxist global assault on America is ALL Americans' duty. This Brave Firefighter did his DUTY! Do not punish him or else we the people will punish YOU HOWEVER LEGALLY POSSIBLE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!The bottom line is we want that firefighter to get recognized as making a VITAL expression about illegal and coercive mandates of these \"biological weapon fake-vaccines\" bringing death and war to America. The firefighter deserves medals and awards for doing his duty to fight the destructive fire of Marxism that is burning our country down!Sincerely,your name here___________________________You can send this letter to all 5 recipients also with a CLICK >>> https://wordaxe.com/join-a-campaign?referral=eGx2TEUyaXFxYW5TMXFHeitpN3o0UT09You can share that link too.you can see how many peopel sent this letter in this campaign by checking the status- https://wordaxe.com/template-counter/?referral=eGx2TEUyaXFxYW5TMXFHeitpN3o0UT09@NaturalNews @INFOWARS @JLF538 @Catturd @AmericanAFMindy @SomeBitchIKnow @Artraven",

The Senate pulled out of a joint plan with the House to pass the legislation this upcoming Monday, and now Governor Eric Holcomb has renewed his emergency for an outlandish 21st time. While we have watched other states push forward vaccine protections, Indiana has fallen short. The Senate does not feel the urgency behind this vaccine protection legislation. They have blocked protections for months, and with each day that goes by, vaccine mandates are becoming more normalized; more jobs are lost; and more people are harmed. The General Assembly must learn how important this issue is to Hoosiers. We will gather in the House chamber hallway on the 3rd floor of the statehouse at 10 am on Monday to join with House members who refuse to back down from this bill. They are ready to get to work and pass this bill, and we want to be there to show our support. If you have lost a job over this issue. Taken the vaccine only to avoid termination. Endured the stress of filing an exemption. Feared the long-term health effects of what a university mandated vaccine will do to your child. Felt isolated by being forced to mask or test in lieu of vaccinating. And most importantly, consider it a violation that business and government have overreached into your most private rights -- those regarding your bodily autonomy -- we need you to show up. We are overwhelmed with gratitude that some House members are unwilling to back down from making this legislation a priority before the end of the year. We need to act and stand in a meaningful way to join with them in demanding vaccine protections go forward. This is not just another rally. This is a time for the people to join hand in hand with legislators to say that we will not wait any longer to put a stop to this infringement into our most personal rights.  We still carry hope that a last-minute deal could come together this upcoming Monday. However, if it does not, we are committed to making vaccine protections our main focus for 2022. Our goal ultimately is to win anti-discrimination protections, so that no Hoosier will be ostracized, punished or fired due to vaccine status. Please join us on Monday at the statehouse.
