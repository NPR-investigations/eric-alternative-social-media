Davis* ruled that top Fox executives Rupert Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch, and Paul Ryan will have to testify live at the trial in the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems.*The $1.6 billion complaint filed by Dominion accuses Fox of airing false claims on the Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network about Dominion‚Äôs voting machines related to former President **Donald Trump‚Äôs* baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Pre-trial discovery in the litigation has revealed a trove of documents https://www.mediaite.com/tv/6-bombshell-revelations-from-trove-of-new-evidence-in-fox-news-defamation-suit/ in which Fox‚Äôs on-air personalities https://www.mediaite.com/tv/i-hate-him-passionately-what-tucker-carlson-says-about-trump-in-private/ and top executives https://www.mediaite.com/news/the-brand-is-now-poison-rupert-murdoch-lamented-trump-businesses-were-ruined-after-jan-6/ exchanged emails and text messages acknowledging Trump had lost the 2020 election, that his claims the election was stolen from him via fraud were unfounded, and lamenting https://www.mediaite.com/tv/tucker-carlson-called-trump-a-demonic-force-and-a-destroyer-on-day-of-capitol-riot-per-newly-released-text/ the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. A new trove of documents with previously redacted https://www.mediaite.com/news/any-and-all-biden-policies-should-be-labeled-socialism-4-new-revelations-from-fox-news-dominion-lawsuit/ comments was released last month.*On March 31, Judge Davis issued a summary judgment ruling https://www.mediaite.com/analysis/judge-scorches-fox-news-claim-their-dominion-coverage-was-protected-opinion-sending-media-case-of-the-century-to-trial/ that was broadly viewed as devastating to Fox, finding that all twenty of the ‚ÄúStatements‚Äù made on air (on either FNC or FBN) about Dominion were statements of fact and not protected opinion and it was ‚ÄúCRYSTAL* clear‚Äù (emphasis in original) that they were all false and constituted defamation per se. The judge also rejected several legal defenses https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/31/media/fox-news-dominion-lawsuit/index.html Fox wished to assert as well as the media giant‚Äôs efforts to limit damages, finding it a matter for the jury.*My impression, which could be entirely mistaken, is that much of Fox, including most of its on-air ‚Äútalent,‚Äù believed the election was legit (or wanted it to be legit) and that they just said things they thought the audience wanted to hear in order to get ratings. In the process, they smeared Dominion.At any rate, this lawsuit will be difficult for Fox. I wish some good information would come out about Dominion‚Äôs real role in the election.4 ReplyGail CombsGail Combs(@gailcombs)OnlineCoyote Reply to  TheseTruths April 6, 2023 11:38#1078516Fox News needs to get Mark Cook to testify about Back Doors and Internet connections!Boy doesn‚Äôt this put Fox between a rock and a hard place?

          "content": "4/6/23 - Paper Ballots Beckonhttp://www.liberato.us/commentary.htmlProblems with electronic voting machines continue to make news.  The Shasta County supervisors in California got rid of Dominion voting machines and went to hand-counting paper ballots for future elections.  Shasta County joins Nye County in Nevada and Osage County in Missouri in making this move.  It‚Äôs not hard to understand the antipathy towards voting machines.  We start with the fact machine vote counting stopped simultaneously in the middle of the night in six swing states in the 2020 election with Trump ahead and, somehow, Biden was ahead when counting resumed.  That‚Äôs never been explained and, as a government minister said, it‚Äôs the same technology they use to steal elections in Venezuela.  Then we had the first court-ordered forensic audit of voting machines after the 2020 election in Antrim County Michigan which found their machines deliberately created a 68 error rate in the results right off the bat that elections officials could then fill in any way they wanted.  Those aren‚Äôt machines that count votes.  Those are machines that do something else.  Other problems with voting machines have been reported more recently:‚Ä¢\tDominion executives admitted their machines are not secure, can be hacked, and are ‚Äúriddled with bugs‚Äù that can lead to incorrect results.‚Ä¢\tA federal cybersecurity agency (CISA) admitted election systems in Georgia have serious problems that could allow bad actors to ‚Äúfix election results‚Äù.  ‚Ä¢\tA voter registration and election management system in use in several states (BPro) is uncertified, untested, and connected to the Internet allowing parties in and out of government to access it.  It can connect with the left-wing nonprofit ERIC and allow the use of plug-ins that can change results.  ‚Ä¢\tIrregularities were discovered in the machine tabulation of the results of a New Jersey school board race after human error during software installation allowed results on USB drives to be counted twice.  An audit failed to catch the problem, which was only discovered later by accident.  The problem was so serious it may flip the outcome in the race.  ‚Ä¢\tA cybersecurity expert recently demonstrated how he could hack voting machines and change results without leaving a trace.  The problem stems from widely-used SQL management software which is not certified and bypasses security features.  He easily manipulated the database with a cell phone and didn‚Äôt even have to enter a password.  ‚Ä¢\tAnother expert disclosed that voting machines in Wisconsin can be hacked, despite years of denials by election officials there.  ‚Ä¢\tAnother expert testified before an Arizona Senate committee it‚Äôs easy to write code to change voting machine results without a trace.  He said machines can be hacked in lots of ways and can never be secured.  The only way to have a secure election is not to use machines, he said.  Think there might be a few problems here?  A resolution passed in the Arizona House and Senate addresses some of them.  The resolution bypasses Arizona‚Äôs far-Left Democrat Governor and requires the Secretary of State not to allow the use of voting machines unless they are designed and made in the U.S. using accredited processes, the source code used for federal elections is made available to the public, and ballot images and system log files are recorded on secure media and publicly posted.

Cela n'emp√™chent pas les trotskistes de pr√©tendre incarner la seule continuit√© du l√©ninisme contre le \"stalinisme\", stalinisme qui n'a jamais exist√©. Staline a toujours rigoureusement appliqu√© les principes l√©ninistes, ainsi que Mao.Ces trotskistes jargonnent, mais ce sont bel est bien des sociaux d√©mocrates dont la seule id√©e stable est de servir la d√©mocratie juive, pas de la renverser.D'ailleurs, M√©lenchon ne parle jamais de r√©volution, mais de \"r√©volution citoyenne\"ce qui ne veut rien dire du point de vue l√©niniste, ni m√™me marxiste.L'antifascisme n'est qu'un √©cran de fum√©e suffisamment √©pais pour semer la confusion √† l'extr√™me gauche. Il permet d'aimanter des √©l√©ments potentiellement violents et de subordonner leur violence √† la d√©fense de la gauche √©tablie plut√¥t qu'√† une action r√©volutionnaire contre l'Etat et sa classe dirigeante.La gauche √©tablie se r√©sume d√©sormais √† la NUPES, n√©buleuse incoh√©rente uniquement soud√©e par l'opportunisme √©lectorale.M√©lenchon √† besoin de nervis, pas de r√©volutionnaire marxistes, et c'est ce r√¥le de chien de garde de la NUPES qu'Arnault remplit. C'est pour cette raison qu'il reprend les symboles de la sociale d√©mocratie.Le type a visiblement des troubles de la personnalit√©, avec une tendance narcissique √©vidente.

He pleaded not guilty to 34 charges regarding allegations that he falsified business records related to Daniels‚Äôs hush money case.Trump was indicted late last week by a Manhattan grand jury in a case involving his purported role in hush money payments to Daniels ahead of the 2016 election, allegedly to keep Daniels quiet about an affair the two of them had in 2006.The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling is separate from the Manhattan case.Trump‚Äôs son, Eric Trump, posted the good news, and lots of commentary followed:‚ÄúBREAKING!!! the 9th Circuit just awarded Trump $121,962.56 in attorney fees from Stormy Daniels.
