The mayor of New York City on Friday evening urged protesters to remain peaceful, and NYPD has made extensive preparations, including asking officers to stay on and work overtime when their shift finishes on Friday.The Nichols family has urged those angered by the footage to remain calm, emphasizing that they support the judicial process and approve of the firing of the five officers. They have stressed that Nichols himself would have hated to see rioting in his name.Yet Antifa is expected to take advantage of the chaos, with the group ordering followers to bring a list of weapons including rocks, kerosene and pipes.Federal buildings are being evacuated ahead of the riots, while businesses in Memphis and Portland are already boarded up to protect from the expected looting.Ahead of Antifa taking to the streets, New York City mayor Eric Adams urged people to 'peacefully voice their concern if the video is what we anticipate it to be'.The NYPD is telling officers to stay on duty rather than clock off on Friday when their shifts end due to 'robust protests', which are expected once the tape is released.",
