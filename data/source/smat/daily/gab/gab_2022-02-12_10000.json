And here comes this nigga tryin' ta shut it down. Mayor Adams must be a white supremacist. BTW, like him, I'd never heard the term \"drill rap\" either.\"New York City Mayor Eric Adams called on Twitter and Instagram to dump 'drill' - meaning to fight or retaliate - rap videos which he says promote gun violence. 'We pulled Trump off Twitter, because of what he was spewing,' he said Friday at a press conference. 'Yet we're allowing music, displaying of guns, violence. We're allowing it to stay on these sites.' He was alerted to the drill rap videos which he says glorify killing after his son, Jordan Coleman, who works for Jay-Z, told him about it.Drill rapping tends to have heavily Autotuned vocals and themes of violence, killing and death. It was the death of Jayquan McKenley, 18, a drill rapper who goes by the name Chii Wvttz, who was killed outside a Brooklyn recording studio last week that struck a chord with the mayor. Adams said he wants to meet with high profile rappers and executives of the social media companies in a push to have the videos removed.The mayor blamed the music and the videos for 'causing the loss of lives of young people like them.' 'You have a civic and corporate responsibility,' he said. 'We are alarmed by the use of social media to really over-proliferate this violence in our communities. This is contributing to the violence that we are seeing all over the country. It one of the rivers we have to dam.'Adams was brought to tears on Thursday during a speech about the young man who was killed on Sunday, blaming the shooting on a 'broken system that 'continually fails black and brown New Yorkers.' McKenley drifted in and out of homeless shelters while growing up in the South Bronx, according to the New York Post. He had a learning disability and often skipped school without assistance from the Department of Education.'We should have done more, I was once a Jayquan too': New...'I didn't know Jayquan, but his death hit me hard because the more I found out about Jayquan's story, the more I saw how many times he had been failed by a system that is supposed to help boys like him,' Adams said.McKenley was killed in an ambush while sitting in a parked car at the corner of Greene and Lewis Avenues in Brooklyn after finishing a recording session at a studio nearby studio.",

This latter group is by far the one mentioned most in the Bible. The translators of the Christian Standard Bible made this distinction in their text.

So Abraham bought a field from a Hethite and David committed adultery with the wife of Uriah the Hethite. However, according to the Bible, Solomon loved many Hittite women and would buy chariots from Egypt and sell them to the Hittites.

I've considered Nevada seriously, but they are even more bankrupt than California, and gaming industry is bailing out of its cities and going online thanks to their losses from the plague closing their casinos. They also support ERIC, which is run by Soros and is making the DEAD VOTE for Democrat-Communists. Utah allows for Woke Mayors who ignore real problems and blame Climate Change and Racism rather than homelessness and drug addiction in their cities.

Because if you don’t remove him, I’m going to try and remove you. And they should remove people who don't enforce the law. Citizens all over  New York state are being killed.”Giuliani was joined by former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik.“There's one thing the mayor didn't say,” Kerik noted. “And I think people should know and understand this: Back in 1993, when Rudy Giuliani came into office, we had four to five times the violent crime and the murders that they have today — four to five times. And people said it could never be changed — it's never going to go down.\"It was criticized by The New York Times and all the liberals and over the eight-year period, we dropped major crime, violent crime, by 65%; murder by 70%; and in the Black community, where the violent crime was the highest, we dropped the murder rate by almost 80%.“The bottom line is, it's all about leadership. Alvin Bragg should be removed. The mayor could do it. If you wanted to do it, he could do it by going to the governor. He could also do it by holding funds. And pulling money from Bragg’s budget.
