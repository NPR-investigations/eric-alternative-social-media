Thankfully, the Caps pulled out a 4-3 OT win to wrap-up the first half of the season.Here&#39;s the scoring summary.Capitals&#39; forward Garnet Hathaway tipped center Lars Eller’s shot to give Washington an early lead in the first period. Then Capitals&#39; D-man Trevor van Riemsdyk extended the lead with a blue-line bomb. That two-goal lead lasted 12 seconds, which is when CBJ&#39;s Andrew Peeke needed two deflections to beat Washington goalie Charlie Lindgren.In the second stanza, van Riemsdyk received a great pass from Washington&#39;s All-Star Center Evgeny Kuznetsov to restore the Caps’ two-goal lead, but it didn’t last long. Columbus&#39; Eric Robinson smoked T.J. Oshie’s line to score on the rush.In the third frame, Blue Jackets&#39; &quot;Johnny Hockey&quot; Gaudreau knotted the game at three goals with seven minutes left. The Jackets pushed late, but the Caps survived through regulation. So it was onto 3-on-3 overtime hockey.In the OT period, Kuznetsov scored in 26 seconds, thanks to a great setup from Washington winger Marcus Johansson.The Caps need a break. In addition to their full-fledged injuries, there are clearly some players playing through &quot;stuff&quot;: Oshie and Ovechkin likely are ailing and I wouldn’t be surprised if D-man Dmitry Orlov is hurting, too. If the last name starts with O, this is a good time to kick back and get a tan. Ten days of very welcome rest begins now.Next Up: After this 10-day break, the Capitals travel to Boston to take on the No. 1 Bruins in a nationally televised matinee game Feb. 11. It will be the first of a home-and-home, back-to-back series with the second matinee game against the San Jose Sharks the next day here in D.C. Capitals beat Blue Jackets 4-3 in OT!#nocaps",

Though well worthy of attention, as Victor Davis Hanson notes, the documents scandal has overshadowed Biden’s indulgence of Chinese spies, on full display in a recent case.“Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have dropped their case against a New York Police Department officer who had been accused of acting as a foreign agent on behalf of the Chinese regime,” The Epoch Times reports.Baimadajie Angwang, 33, an ethnic Tibetan and naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested in 2020 for acting as an agent of Beijing, for wire fraud, making false statements, and obstructing an official proceeding. Prosecutors charge that Angwang reported on Chinese citizens, cultivated intelligence sources, and connected Chinese officials with senior contacts in the New York Police Department.The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of New York recently filed a motion asking federal Judge Eric R. Komitee, a Trump nominee, to dismiss the indictment due to “additional information.” The Eastern District did not reveal the information or explain its relevance to the case. The move illuminates official Biden policy toward Chinese espionage in the United States.“The Justice Department is ending a controversial program, launched under the Trump administration, to hunt down Chinese spies,” CBS News reported last year. President Trump’s “China Initiative” targeted China’s theft of trade secrets and intellectual property.As federal prosecutors charged in 2017, MIT professor Gang Chen failed to disclose ties to China and failed to disclose a foreign bank account on a tax document. Prosecutors dropped the case against Chen, but it wasn’t clear what motivated them to act. This was hardly the only proceeding against Chinese agents the Justice Department chose to abandon.In 2020, federal officials changed that Chinese national Tang Juan lied about ties to the Chinese military in order to gain access to the University of California at Davis. The FBI found an April 14, 2019 article on a Xi’an, China, healthcare forum that showed Tang in a military uniform bearing the insignia of the Civilian Cadres of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The FBI also found two other articles listing Tang’s employer as the People’s Liberation Army’s Air Force Medical University (AFMU), also known as the Fourth Military Medical University (FMMU).According to court documents, Tang was part of a PLA operation to send military scientists to the United States with false covers or false statements about their true employment. Military superiors in China tasked the spies to copy and steal information from American institutions.Tang Juan also emerged in the visa fraud case of Song Chen. According to July 20, 2020, court documents, “an active duty People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military scientist who lied to get into the United States, attempted to destroy evidence, and lied extensively to the FBI when interviewed.”The documents also cite Wang Xin, a visiting researcher at the University of California at San Francisco arrested on charges of visa fraud. Wang was “in fact an active duty member in the PLA, at a level that roughly corresponded with the level of major in the United States.” Wang had “emailed UCSF research to his PLA laboratory,” and his supervisor in China tasked Wang “to observe and document the layout of the UCSF lab to replicate it when he returned to China.”The court documents refer to Tang Juan, also in the United States on a J-1 visa. So was a Chinese national identified as “LT,” who gained access to Duke University despite affiliations with “the PLA General Hospital and PLA Medical Academy.” Americans have cause to wonder why the visas were granted in the first place.A simple internet search turned up PLA and CCP ties for Tang Juan and others now facing charges. The court documents do not reveal which U.S. government officials granted the visas, and what they knew when they approved Chinese nationals with PLA and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ties.",

          "content": "1 of 2 -Well, I WAS going to do a whole bunch of research on the subject. No need to now. This paragraph pretty much took 100% of the words and made the entire thing to be self-explanatory:“How does the Roman Catholic understanding of ‘saints’ compare with the biblical teaching? Not very well. In Roman Catholic theology, the saints are in heaven. In the Bible, the saints are on earth. In Roman Catholic teaching, a person does not become a saint unless he/she is ‘beatified’ or ‘canonized’ by the Pope or prominent bishop. In the Bible, everyone who has received Jesus Christ by faith is a saint. In Roman Catholic practice, the saints are revered, prayed to, and in some instances, worshiped. In the Bible, saints are called to revere, worship, and pray to God alone.”https://www.gotquestions.org/saints-Christian.htmlA “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not God The Father.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. A person ultimately only affects him or herself and forever’s a long time. We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law.According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them and according to 1 John 4:1, instructions are to test the spirits.Over the years, there has been quite a lot taught about Christianity. The problem is, many of those things simply are not in The Bible. Makes one wonder at times - Human opinion versus God The Father’s opinion...Wonder who would win? Additionally, Mosaic Law and/or other types of Legalism - Sad, huh? One thing to also remember is that there are dozens of each, cults and false religions. Many of them have done a SPECTACULAR job of messing up the Gospel message with either bogus teachings, fake literature based on fake Bibles and so on.Sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which God The Father created that person, self included. No one is perfect and there is no one righteous...AT ALL (Isaiah 64:6, John 8:7, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:21-26). EVERYONE needs a savior (1 John 1:8-10). As long as a person is able to identify from the heart with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus...ONLY...that person is justified (Galatians 2:20-21, Romans 5:10, Romans 6:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17). Anything above and beyond that is merely some human attempting to push some “religion”, or “sin management”, or “man-plan”. (SIDE NOTE – The term “Christ” is a title, not a name.

          "contentraw": "1 of 2 -<br /><br />Well, I WAS going to do a whole bunch of research on the subject. No need to now. This paragraph pretty much took 100% of the words and made the entire thing to be self-explanatory:<br />“How does the Roman Catholic understanding of ‘saints’ compare with the biblical teaching? Not very well. In Roman Catholic theology, the saints are in heaven. In the Bible, the saints are on earth. In Roman Catholic teaching, a person does not become a saint unless he/she is ‘beatified’ or ‘canonized’ by the Pope or prominent bishop. In the Bible, everyone who has received Jesus Christ by faith is a saint. In Roman Catholic practice, the saints are revered, prayed to, and in some instances, worshiped. In the Bible, saints are called to revere, worship, and pray to God alone.”<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.gotquestions.org/saints-Christian.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>gotquestions.org/saints-Christian.html<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not God The Father.<br /><br />An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father).<br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11).

(Ballotpedia)<br />The Biden Recession: The Dow is down. Unemployment rate is 3.5%. Inflation is 6.5%. 💥 <br /><br />Gas is $3.51/gallon. (AAA)  <br /><br />RCP averages: Joe's job approval rating spread is -9.7%. 🙄<br />His job approval avg.: 42.8%.👎 Where is the blowback from his classified document obfuscation and UPenn?  More classified documents \"discovered\".  Unlike Trump, Biden did not have the power to declassify. <br />Quinnipiac reports: 38%, -15. <br /><br />Build The Wall<br />After reaching agreements with private property owners, TX takes over building the border wall, starting with 7 miles near Del Rio.<br />Gov. Abbott creates Texas border czar position and hires Mike Banks, a recently retired border patrol agent, to fill it.<br />Biden should be impeached for failing to protect the border and U.S citizens.<br /><br />On Covid<br />CDC Panel votes to add Covid-19 Jab to Recommended Childhood Schedule. Resist until all the jab information is released. Children are not susceptible to Covid.  These vaccinations are irreversible. <br />The Washington Post (gasp) reported that 58% of coronavirus deaths in August were people who were vaccinated or boosted.  More sudden deaths. Anti Covid vaxxers and vaccine-injured protest outside the BBC in London.<br /><br />Law and Order<br />November 19, 2022,  Judge Loretta Preska ordered dozens of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's associates to be unsealed, according to Daily Mail.<br />Since then, crickets.🦗<br /><br />Current events <br />In AZ, Kari Lake held a Save Arizona Rally Sunday. POTUS Trump called in to offer his support. Kari claims 200,000 failed? votes have been found. The appeals court rules today. <br />Paul Pelosi's police surveillance video(s) were released. <br />Kevin McCarthy 👢ed  Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell from the Intelligence committee and explained to Minority Leader Jeffries that they are untrustworthy (with facts!)  <br />Ilhan Omar says it is racist (imagine that) to boot her from the Foreign Affairs committee, and says some Republicans will vote for her.<br />The Daily Mail just reported that there has been a DNA match to prove that Ilhan married her brother to break immigration laws. And they now confirm that Omar reported years ago to friends she had indeed married her brother.  Prosecute!<br />Federal prosecutors said Sam Bankman-Fried has made “recent attempts” to contact prospective witnesses in his criminal case, and are asking for new conditions of his release.<br />✈️ The FAA paused all domestic departures in the US on the morning of January 11th because its Notice to Air Missions system failed. Contractors working on the FAA's NOTAM system, it seems, deleted some crucial files by accident. 🤦‍♀️<br />24 year old Bills' Damar Hamlin continues to recuperate at home.  <br />Twitter Files drop.
