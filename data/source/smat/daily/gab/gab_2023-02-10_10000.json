The Democrat party was founded in hatred of American principles and has continued in that way ever since, today embracing Marxism and anti-white racism and attacking the family. They continue to undermine efforts to investigate corruption in our government, taking no interest in hearings about Twitter censorship or the weaponization of the Department of Justice and the FBI. The Chinese spy balloon is another massive coverup by the Biden Administration, just like with the classified documents and the Hunter Biden laptop. It’s why Democrats are sabotaging and undermining House committees that are trying to investigate these issues. AG Merrick Garland has assisted in the obstruction and coverup of Joe Biden’s possession of classified documents, while at the same time subpoenaing and pressuring Republicans to turn on Trump for having documents. Later, Mark speaks with columnist Miranda Devine about the media’s willingness to cover up the Hunter Biden laptop and the Biden Crime family, and Democrat politicians who turn it into a discussion about January 6th. Mark is also joined by Eric Bolling to discuss the censorship of conservative voices in America and cable networks dropping conservative news stations.",

James Comer (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent letters to Hunter Biden as well as the president's brother, James Biden, and their former business partner Eric Schwerin. In his request to Hunter Biden, Comer asked for a wide range of communications with Joe and James Biden, as well as with James's wife, Sara.Comer also sought financial records, scheduling documents and rent payments.The request for documents covers the period of Jan. 20, 2009, to Jan. 20, 2021 — extending from Joe Biden's rise to the vice presidency until his swearing-in as president — and appears focused on business deals that Hunter Biden and his uncle pursued with a Chinese energy conglomerate.The Washington Post examined that business arrangement in a story last year, finding that over the course of 14 months, the Chinese company and its executives paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and his uncle.The Post did not find evidence that Joe Biden personally benefited from or knew details about the transactions with CEFC, which took place after he had left the vice presidency and before he announced his intentions to run for the White House in 2020.",

In his request to Hunter Biden, Comer asked for a wide range of communications with Joe and James Biden, as well as with James's wife, Sara.<br /><br />Comer also sought financial records, scheduling documents and rent payments.<br /><br />The request for documents covers the period of Jan. 20, 2009, to Jan. 20, 2021 — extending from Joe Biden's rise to the vice presidency until his swearing-in as president — and appears focused on business deals that Hunter Biden and his uncle pursued with a Chinese energy conglomerate.<br /><br />The Washington Post examined that business arrangement in a story last year, finding that over the course of 14 months, the Chinese company and its executives paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and his uncle.<br /><br />The Post did not find evidence that Joe Biden personally benefited from or knew details about the transactions with CEFC, which took place after he had left the vice presidency and before he announced his intentions to run for the White House in 2020.",

I mean “no”!Get out of my country!New York Post:----------------------------------------------------------------------------At least 500 migrants attempted to illegally cross into the US at border hot spot El Paso Wednesday — wrongly believing they could get free passage to Canada or laws had changed allowing them to seek asylum on American soil.US Border Patrol agents in El Paso said they encountered the surge of migrants between 8:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. around one of the main border gates into the country.Photos and video from the area show hundreds of hopeful asylum seekers from central and south America lined up at the border fence, a scene not seen in 2023 after the government expanded the number of countries whose citizens are expelled under Title 42.Border agents said most of the migrants were from Venezuela, and many told them they had been told US border policies had changed and they would be allowed to stay in America if they crossed the border – rumors likely spread through social media.Sources told The Post other migrants had heard about New York City funding free bus tickets to migrants who want to pursue asylum claims in Canada and wrongly believed they would be sent there if they crossed the border.However, border agents informed the migrants no policies have changed and under measure Title 42, the US is still expelling illegal border crossers from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Haiti back to Mexico.In a statement issued Thursday, Border Patrol said: “The El Paso Sector would like to inform migrants that nothing has changed. The US Border Patrol in the El Paso Sector continues to expel migrants under CDC’s Title 42 authority.”Buses to Canada have been laid on from New York by charity organizations, as the city struggles to deal with some 40,000 migrants who have been bused their by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as El Paso mayor Oscar Leeser.Abbott recently tweeted about the program, calling Mayor Eric Adams a hypocrite.“New York City is busing migrants north after attacking the Texas busing mission,’ Abbott wrote Thursday.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Yeah, great job Greg, you smarmy spineless faggot cripple piece of shit.No one wanted these apes shipped to New York, and no one cares about Democrat hypocrisy.WE WANT YOU TO SEND THESE PEOPLE BACK TO MEXICO, GREG.Greg Abbot is like a parody of a cuckold.He literally has to hire someone to please his wife because his dick is as limp as his governance.He literally says “well, you see, these Democrats are a bunch of hypocrites” and asks like we’ve not all been hearing that from do-nothing con artists like him for our entire lives.It’s not a novel insight, Greg.They are hypocrites.

They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not God The Father.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. A person ultimately only affects him or herself and forever’s a long time. We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law.Will cheerfully do what God The Father says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with God The Father happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in God The Father than it is to put confidence in man.(SIDE NOTE - The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you. It’s more accurate and allowing Him to live in you is more feasible than merely trying to imitate behavior(s).",

In this age of deception, can we even trust anything we hear on the news?  We're not about how many people we can get into our group here.  We have no interest in being a group that is 5 miles wide and 2 inches deep.  In this group, you're going to hear things that 95% of today's average Christians may not understand because dealing with it would make them uncomfortable and today's average American Christian desires comfortable Christianity above all else.  That is because today's church is under very deep deception that Jesus told us to watch closely for in the last days.   If you are looking for deeper insights on where we really are on the prophetic timeline, then this may be a group you want to join.   If you are waiting to be raptured away before the tribulation begins, just before the real Christians will likely have to suffer persecution for their faith, you probably won't want to join this group.  ALL POSTING IN THIS GROUP SHOULD relate directly to last days events as prophesied in the Bible and ALL LINKS MUST HAVE AT LEAST A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS BEING LINKED TO.  All posts that do not relate directly to final days events as prophesied in the bible will be removed.  Haters/disrespecters will be banned, as will pretentious theological pontificators seeking to argue every nuance of every post.",
