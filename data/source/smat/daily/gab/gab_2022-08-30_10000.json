Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth, only Earth quakes. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored.Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it&#39;s an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The &quot;Antarctic Treaty&quot; prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, other lands beyond Antarctica ?This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language). Accounts set to &#39;Private&#39;, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers.This group has never, and will never, ask for a dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the multitudes of facts with undeniable evidence evoking our true Level and Stationary Earth Plane. Truth is like a breath of fresh air, Truth will break you free from the Echo Chamber of Deception.<br /><\/li><\/ul>",

Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal.

Now as we take a dip in the ocean of nostalgia and sail away into the sunset, the last thing you remember is the sound of my voice yelling at a police helicopter &quot;Nobody is going to stop us!&quot;<\/p><p>The 80&#39;s will live on forever.<\/p>",
