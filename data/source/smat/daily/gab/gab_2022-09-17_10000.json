Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

Greg Abbott over the next year.

The labor force participation rate edged DOWN  to 62.1% in July.  50% of employers anticipate job cuts in the next six months.Feds have raised the interest rates 4 times this year.

Nearly 5 MILLION illegals have skipped across Joe's border already.  TX Gov Abbott has now added Chicago to the list of self-proclaimed sanctuary cities he is bussing illegals to. Mayor Lightfoot is bussing them out to the suburbs. In DC, 2 buses were dropped off in front of Kamala's Naval Observatory residence.  No welcome wagon?

No, the NIH still does NOT advise using ivermectin to treat Covid-19 except in clinical trials.

          "content": "“I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late ALWAYS sounds better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is.MATTHEW 7:21-23 (NLT)“Not everyone who calls out to me, ‘Lord! Lord!’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter. On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’ But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’(”)JOHN 6:29 (NLT)Jesus told them, “This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent.”GALATIANS 3:28-29 (NLT)There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God’s promise to Abraham belongs to you.2 TIMOTHY 3:5 (NLT)They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!https://www.biblegateway.com/There are literally dozens of each, cults and false religions.A cult is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm ) is only qualified to teach the new covenant (see 2 Corinthians 3:4-11 for more information). Forever’s a long time.Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 says that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.Over the years, there has been quite a lot taught about Christianity. The problem is, many of those things simply are not in The Bible. Makes one wonder at times: Human opinion versus The Lord’s opinion...Wonder who would win? Additionally - Legalism: Sad, huh?Sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included. No one is perfect and there is no one righteous...AT ALL (Isaiah 64:6, John 8:7, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:21-26, 1 John 1:8-10). According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them. EVERYONE needs a savior (1 John 1:8-10). As long as a person is able to identify from the heart with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus...ONLY...that person is justified (Galatians 2:20-21, Romans 5:10, Romans 6:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17). Anything above and beyond that is merely some human attempting to push some “religion”, or “sin management”, or “man-plan”. (SIDE NOTE: The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.) Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you.“...and the truth shall set you free” (John 8:31-32). (Proverbs 3:5-6, Proverbs 27:17, Hebrews 4:12, Hebrews 10:14, Jude 1:23, etc. are additional motives.)",
          "contentraw": "“I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late ALWAYS sounds better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is.<br /><br />MATTHEW 7:21-23 (NLT)<br />“Not everyone who calls out to me, ‘Lord! Lord!’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter. On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’ But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’(”)<br />JOHN 6:29 (NLT)<br />Jesus told them, “This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent.”<br />GALATIANS 3:28-29 (NLT)<br />There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God’s promise to Abraham belongs to you.<br />2 TIMOTHY 3:5 (NLT)<br />They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!<br /><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>biblegateway.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />There are literally dozens of each, cults and false religions.<br /><br />A cult is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on.<br /><br />An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). <br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>biblehub.com/greek/509.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> ) is only qualified to teach the new covenant (see 2 Corinthians 3:4-11 for more information). Forever’s a long time.<br /><br />Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical.
