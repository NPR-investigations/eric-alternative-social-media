They want their country back. They're tired of these elites telling us about the sovereignty of other countries' borders, but the president does nothing about the sovereignty of our own southern border.”Delivering oral arguments at the Supreme Court Tuesday, Missouri and Texas petitioned the high court to uphold a lower court's decision and force the Biden administration to continue to reimplement the successful Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy.The ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy forced most migrants attempting to enter the United States at the southern border to wait in Mexico for their immigration hearings.According to Schmitt, the policy prevented thousands of illegal immigrants from entering and disappearing into the U.S. and discouraged thousands more from attempting to enter.Schmitt said that without policies like ‘Remain in Mexico,’ up to 30 million people could flood the southern border and enter the country illegally.“That is five Missouris,” he said. “That's how serious this is.”When asked if the southern border crisis legally constituted an invasion, Schmitt said, “This is uncharted territory.”“The president of the United States is actually saying we do not have a sovereign border,” he said. “This has never quite happened in this way.”Schmitt said he believes the Democrats’ plan, when it comes to immigration, is to allow millions of migrants to enter and grant them amnesty once they are here.https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/eric-schmitt-remain-in-mexico-border-crisis/2022/04/26/id/1067379/※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",

They want their country back. They're tired of these elites telling us about the sovereignty of other countries' borders, but the president does nothing about the sovereignty of our own southern border.”<br /><br />Delivering oral arguments at the Supreme Court Tuesday, Missouri and Texas petitioned the high court to uphold a lower court's decision and force the Biden administration to continue to reimplement the successful Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy.<br /><br />The ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy forced most migrants attempting to enter the United States at the southern border to wait in Mexico for their immigration hearings.<br /><br />According to Schmitt, the policy prevented thousands of illegal immigrants from entering and disappearing into the U.S. and discouraged thousands more from attempting to enter.<br /><br />Schmitt said that without policies like ‘Remain in Mexico,’ up to 30 million people could flood the southern border and enter the country illegally.<br /><br />“That is five Missouris,” he said. “That's how serious this is.”<br /><br />When asked if the southern border crisis legally constituted an invasion, Schmitt said, “This is uncharted territory.”<br /><br />“The president of the United States is actually saying we do not have a sovereign border,” he said. “This has never quite happened in this way.”<br /><br />Schmitt said he believes the Democrats’ plan, when it comes to immigration, is to allow millions of migrants to enter and grant them amnesty once they are here.<br /><a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/eric-schmitt-remain-in-mexico-border-crisis/2022/04/26/id/1067379/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/eric-schmitt-remain-in<span class=\"invisible\">-mexico-border-crisis/2022/04/26/id/1067379/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />※※<br />CHINA COMRADES WITHIN<br /><a href=\"/tags/Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA<\/a><br /><a href=\"/tags/MAGA_PATRIOTS\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#MAGA_PATRIOTS<\/a> SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by Precinct<br />JOIN The Precinct Project<br /><a href=\"https://precinctstrategy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>precinctstrategy.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Join your local GOP, take it over, &amp; register new voter",

They want their country back. They're tired of these elites telling us about the sovereignty of other countries' borders, but the president does nothing about the sovereignty of our own southern border.”Delivering oral arguments at the Supreme Court Tuesday, Missouri and Texas petitioned the high court to uphold a lower court's decision and force the Biden administration to continue to reimplement the successful Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy.The ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy forced most migrants attempting to enter the United States at the southern border to wait in Mexico for their immigration hearings.According to Schmitt, the policy prevented thousands of illegal immigrants from entering and disappearing into the U.S. and discouraged thousands more from attempting to enter.Schmitt said that without policies like ‘Remain in Mexico,’ up to 30 million people could flood the southern border and enter the country illegally.“That is five Missouris,” he said. “That's how serious this is.”When asked if the southern border crisis legally constituted an invasion, Schmitt said, “This is uncharted territory.”“The president of the United States is actually saying we do not have a sovereign border,” he said. “This has never quite happened in this way.”Schmitt said he believes the Democrats’ plan, when it comes to immigration, is to allow millions of migrants to enter and grant them amnesty once they are here.https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/eric-schmitt-remain-in-mexico-border-crisis/2022/04/26/id/1067379/※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",

The provision punishes schools that allow transgender athletes >>Lee signed House Bill 1895, which pulls state funding from schools that allow transgender students to play for sports teams that are not their biological sex. The measure added to the existing law will take effect July 1. The measure will require the state’s education commissioner to withhold a portion of the state education funds from school districts that do not determine a student-athlete’s gender using the student’s original birth certificate. Last year, Lee signed into law a requirement for students in fourth grade and older to provide legal documentation of their biological sex to participate in school sports. In a tweet, the Governor wrote that the law would protect the integrity of women’s sports.In recent weeks, several GOP governors have recently signed legislation to protect women's sports, such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. This comes after a biological male transgender swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania, Will “Lia” Thomas, competed against women all season and won at the NCAA swimming championships.On the other hand, GOP governors Eric Holcomb of Indiana and Spencer Cox of Utah vetoed similar legislation protecting women’s sports.
