We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",

Determined to stop his high-octane lethal feud is Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen.\r\nPredictably, the inquisition starts in the city’s police headquarters. There, the veteran cop finds nailing a jelly to the wall far easier than stopping a merc’ on a mission.\r\nIn the predator’s cross-hairs are the most sinister but successful sinners of Liverpool’s underworld. ‘Mess with the best, die like the rest’ appears to be Jack Scarlett’s maxim as after being crossed in love and trust he evens the score.\r\nThe killer question is, can Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen stop Jack Scarlett, and does he really want to. That is for you to decide.",

Has anybody ever come up with a rational explanation for doing this?  This is why Holder refused to discuss it with Congress.  The only logical explanation that I could come up with for that debacle was that the intent was to foster a rash of gun violence incidents that would give Obama justification to take away 2nd amendment rights.",

This is movement in his lawsuit against top-ranking Biden Administration officials for allegedly colluding to suppress freedom of speech. The list of granted depositions includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, Director of White House Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, CISA Director Jen Easterly, and FBI Supervisory Special Agent Elvis Chan. The original lawsuit was filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry on May 5, 2022. Missouri and Louisiana filed a Motion for Expedited Preliminary Injunction-Related Discovery on June 17, 2022, and that motion was granted on July 12, 2022, clearing the way for Missouri and Louisiana to gather discovery and documents from Biden Administration officials and social media companies.“After finding documentation of a collusive relationship between the Biden Administration and social media companies to censor free speech, we immediately filed a motion to get these officials under oath,” said Schmitt. “It is high time we shine a light on this censorship enterprise and force these officials to come clean to the American people, and this ruling will allow us to do just that.

The list of granted depositions includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, Director of White House Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, CISA Director Jen Easterly, and FBI Supervisory Special Agent Elvis Chan. <br /><br />The original lawsuit was filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry on May 5, 2022. Missouri and Louisiana filed a Motion for Expedited Preliminary Injunction-Related Discovery on June 17, 2022, and that motion was granted on July 12, 2022, clearing the way for Missouri and Louisiana to gather discovery and documents from Biden Administration officials and social media companies.<br /><br />“After finding documentation of a collusive relationship between the Biden Administration and social media companies to censor free speech, we immediately filed a motion to get these officials under oath,” said Schmitt. <br /><br />“It is high time we shine a light on this censorship enterprise and force these officials to come clean to the American people, and this ruling will allow us to do just that. We’ll keep pressing for the truth.”<br /><br />The full ruling can be read here.<br /><br />Join the discussion: <br />🗣@COVID1984chat",

The banks have all become members of the U.N. Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which aim to reduce all carbon emissions in their respective lending and investment portfolios by the year 2050. The NZBA, which was formed in April of 2021, already has 119 members across 41 countries, thus accounting for at least 39 percent of the world’s banking assets.The investigation, first announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R-Texas), will determine whether or not the banks have violated consumer protection law.“NZBA is an agreement between major banking institutions to support the climate agenda by choosing not to work with companies engaged in fossil fuel-related activities,” said Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich. “This means some farmers, oil leasing companies, and other businesses will be unable to get a loan because of the alliance.”“The radical climate change movement has been waging an all-out war against American energy for years, and the last thing Americans need right now are corporate activists helping the left bankrupt our fossil fuel industry,” Paxton said in a statement. “If the largest banks in the world think they can get away with lying to consumers or taking any other illegal action designed to target a vital American industry like energy, they’re dead wrong. This investigation is just getting started, and we won’t stop until we get to the truth.”The UN-led emissions pledge is just one example of the broad push by globalist activists for various corporations to adopt “environmental, social, and corporate governance” (ESG) policies. ESG often focuses on such matters as alleged “global warming,” as well as the promotion of diversity, including race-based hiring and indoctrination of Critical Race Theory, and support for the scientifically-debunked concept of transgenderism.",

          "content": "The war between states and banks over environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and similar practices has reached the doorstep of the U.N. A total of 19 state attorneys general have launched investigations of major financial institutions’ commitment to the U.N.-convened Net-Zero Banking Alliance.The alliance’s website states that its members control roughly 40 percent of the world’s banking assets and are “committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050.”“The Net-Zero Banking Alliance is a massive worldwide agreement by major banking institutions, overseen by the U.N., to starve companies engaged in fossil fuel-related activities of credit on national and international markets,” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement regarding the investigations.A May statement from the alliance states that it “does not support the financing of fossil fuel expansion” but notes that it “believes that immediate divestment from existing fossil fuel positions will not necessarily bring about the required real economy decarbonization that the world needs.”“We are leading a coalition investigating banks for ceding authority to the U.N., which will only result in the killing of American companies that don’t subscribe to the woke climate agenda. These banks are accountable to American laws–we don’t let international bodies set the standards for our businesses,” Schmitt said.Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia are among the states now investigating the banks through a powerful tool known as a civil investigative demand.One demand encompasses the following requests: “Describe Your involvement in each Global Climate Initiative in which You participate, including the date You first began participating; any promises, pledges, or other commitments You made to the Global Climate Initiative; or any actions You made or took pursuant to, or consistent with, such commitments, or Your initial or on-going participation, and the employee(s) responsible for managing Your relationship with each Global Climate Initiative.”Schmitt’s announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running conflict between major financial institutions and individual U.S. states regarding ESG.State treasurers, such as West Virginia’s Riley Moore, have sought to move their state’s money from financial institutions that follow ESG principles.Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, praised the investigations.“States are holding big banks accountable for obvious violations and for peddling highly questionable climate initiatives under the label of ESG—all part of a coordinated effort to handicap American energy at the expense of U.S. consumers,” Hild said in a statement regarding the investigations.On the other side of the coin, environmental groups have criticized the U.N.’s alliance for accommodating financial institutions that they believe haven’t gone far enough in divesting from coal, oil, and natural gas.“It’s time for the NZBA [Net-Zero Banking Alliance] to make clear that banks who continue to finance massive fossil fuel expansion while making grand pronouncements about climate goals are not welcome in the alliance,” said Adele Shraiman of the Sierra Club’s Fossil-Free Finance campaign at Climate Week NYC, Reuters reported.The Epoch Times reached out to Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo for comment. JP Morgan Chase declined to comment. None of the other banks responded by press time.https://www.theepochtimes.com/19-states-to-investigate-banks-for-esg-style-commitment-to-united-nations-alliance_4807984.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",

The war between states and banks over environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and similar practices has reached the doorstep of the U.N. A total of 19 state attorneys general have launched investigations of major financial institutions’ commitment to the U.N.-convened Net-Zero Banking Alliance. The alliance’s website states that its members control roughly 40 percent of the world’s banking assets and are “committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050.” “The Net-Zero Banking Alliance is a massive worldwide agreement by major banking institutions, overseen by the U.N., to starve companies engaged in fossil fuel-related activities of credit on national and international markets,” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement regarding the investigations. A May statement from the alliance states that it “does not support the financing of fossil fuel expansion” but notes that it “believes that immediate divestment from existing fossil fuel positions will not necessarily bring about the required real economy decarbonization that the world needs.” “We are leading a coalition investigating banks for ceding authority to the U.N., which will only result in the killing of American companies that don’t subscribe to the woke climate agenda. These banks are accountable to American laws–we don’t let international bodies set the standards for our businesses,” Schmitt said. Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia are among the states now investigating the banks through a powerful tool known as a civil investigative demand. One demand encompasses the following requests: “Describe Your involvement in each Global Climate Initiative in which You participate, including the date You first began participating; any promises, pledges, or other commitments You made to the Global Climate Initiative; or any actions You made or took pursuant to, or consistent with, such commitments, or Your initial or on-going participation, and the employee(s) responsible for managing Your relationship with each Global Climate Initiative.” Schmitt’s announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running conflict between major financial institutions and individual U.S. states regarding ESG. State treasurers, such as West Virginia’s Riley Moore, have sought to move their state’s money from financial institutions that follow ESG principles. Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, praised the investigations. “States are holding big banks accountable for obvious violations and for peddling highly questionable climate initiatives under the label of ESG—all part of a coordinated effort to handicap American energy at the expense of U.S. consumers,” Hild said in a statement regarding the investigations.

They believe that a woman has the right to kill her child and even if you don't accept that as normal and natural your CFR run government can use your tax dollars to advance her insanity that freedom is the freedom to do anything you like even destroy the life of your own child.  And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant, or become a woman by mutilating's himself,   or two men using each others anus as a sex organ is normal the CFR run government will use your tax dollars  to help him convince others to accept his insanity as normal or suffer financial and legal penalties. Meanwhile the CFR doesn't give a rats ass about women's rights or whether a man can turn into a woman by cutting off his penis and testicles. They care about destroying the constitution and the way they are doing that is by undermining God's law and natural law upon which our constitution is based with unconstitutional man made laws. Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution. Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: San-dra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this re-sult in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant, or become a woman by mutilating's himself,   or two men using each others anus as a sex organ is normal the CFR run government will use your tax dollars  to help him convince others to accept his insanity as normal or suffer financial and legal penalties. Meanwhile the CFR doesn't give a rats ass about women's rights or whether a man can turn into a woman by cutting off his penis and testicles. They care about destroying the constitution and the way they are doing that is by undermining God's law and natural law upon which our constitution is based with unconstitutional man made laws. Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution. Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion.

Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty.

They believe that a woman has the right to kill her child and even if you don't accept that as normal and natural your CFR run government can use your tax dollars to advance her insanity that freedom is the freedom to do anything you like even destroy the life of your own child.  And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant, or become a woman by mutilating's himself,   or two men using each others anus as a sex organ is normal the CFR run government will use your tax dollars  to help him convince others to accept his insanity as normal or suffer financial and legal penalties. Meanwhile the CFR doesn't give a rats ass about women's rights or whether a man can turn into a woman by cutting off his penis and testicles. They care about destroying the constitution and the way they are doing that is by undermining God's law and natural law upon which our constitution is based with unconstitutional man made laws. Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution. Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: San-dra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this re-sult in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

They believe that a woman has the right to kill her child and even if you don't accept that as normal and natural your CFR run government can use your tax dollars to advance her insanity that freedom is the freedom to do anything you like even destroy the life of your own child.  And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant, or become a woman by mutilating's himself,   or two men using each others anus as a sex organ is normal the CFR run government will use your tax dollars  to help him convince others to accept his insanity as normal or suffer financial and legal penalties. Meanwhile the CFR doesn't give a rats ass about women's rights or whether a man can turn into a woman by cutting off his penis and testicles. They care about destroying the constitution and the way they are doing that is by undermining God's law and natural law upon which our constitution is based with unconstitutional man made laws. Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution. Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: San-dra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this re-sult in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

          "contentraw": "There is  something awfully queer about CFR members who run our government and their CFR corporate bought politicians -- they seem to believe sexual deviancy and murdering ones child are normal. They believe that a woman has the right to kill her child and even if you don't accept that as normal and natural your CFR run government can use your tax dollars to advance her insanity that freedom is the freedom to do anything you like even destroy the life of your own child.  And even if you don't believe a man can get pregnant, or become a woman by mutilating's himself,   or two men using each others anus as a sex organ is normal the CFR run government will use your tax dollars  to help him convince others to accept his insanity as normal or suffer financial and legal penalties. <br /><br />Meanwhile the CFR doesn't give a rats ass about women's rights or whether a man can turn into a woman by cutting off his penis and testicles. They care about destroying the constitution and the way they are doing that is by undermining God's law and natural law upon which our constitution is based with unconstitutional man made laws. <br /><br />Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution. Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.<br /><br />Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: San-dra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.<br /><br />CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this re-sult in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”<br /><br />This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how<span class=\"invisible\">-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] <a href=\"https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them <a href=\"https://logcabin.org/?s=trump\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>logcabin.org/?s=trump<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />An Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5<span class=\"invisible\">787ab75e4b0867123dff357<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celeb<span class=\"invisible\">rates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

          "content": "Ball model's stationary sun has a deadly, impossible to fix fatal flaw killing ball model dead. Aside from new moon, moon is visible every 24 hr, which works on Flat Earth where both sun and moon rotate above Flat Earth. Ball model's stationary sun kills this off.Let's take a look at why. Is the moon out every night? Asked By : Laura Gordon Aside from cloud cover and sunlight,&nbsp;the moon is visible every day&nbsp;in each 24-hour cycle of the earth’s rotation, even if you’re at the north or south pole. Ouch! That's gotta hurt for ball model!https://dailyjustnow.com/en/is-the-moon-out-every-night-38996/ Flat Earth:Sun/moon rotate over Flat Earth.We see moon, even North and South.Every single night on Flat Earth.0 problems. Just works. Ball model.🌞🌕🌍 Sun is stationary, relative to Earth.Ball model states Earth rotates CCW at 1,038 mph to complete 24,901 mile circumference rotation in 24 hr. But, the problem is the sun isn't moving on ball model, relative to Earth sitting there spinning beside sun. That leaves the moon moving around spinning ball sitting next to stationary sun. The fatal problem here is, it takes the moon 29.5 days to orbit Earth. Moon can only move about 12° daily in its orbit around Earth due to 1 month long orbit circle, say ball resources. Using Earth as a reference point may be a little tricky. The reason is, ballers claim moon moves CCW in same direction as CCW Earth, but a little slower. Let's eliminate Earth frame of reference. What doesn't move, relative to moon?The sun. Why the sun?Sun is stationary, relative to Earth.And, that makes it stationary relative to moon also, since moon rotates around Earth and with Earth. Since we now have a stationary frame of reference, and we know day and night on ball model do not come from sun and moon rotating ball, but ball Earth rotating into day and night with moon crawling a miserly 12° daily while ball Earth rotates below, we are now getting into the ball model's fatal and unfixable deadly flaw, that kills and eliminates ball as a 'working model' since there is no way to fix this glaring gaping hole in the model that does not conform to reality. We know from ball publications the moon has to be visible absolutely every single night, except new moons, even to North and South. This won't work on ball.The reason it won't work, is ball has ½ ball always in daylight on day side, while the other ½ ball is always in night on night side. Even though ball model attempts to fix things by stating you rotate into day and night at 1,038 mph, causing day and night each 24 hr, what they are unable to fix is the moon. At 12° daily rotation around rotating Earth, this means the progression of the moon around the ball relative to stationary sun is going to take about 2 weeks on day side of ball. What this means is, ball can rotate all it wants at any speed it wants during these 2 weeks, but you'll never see the moon at night for ½ month or 2 weeks. It is impossible to see moon at night while it's on the same identical side as the sun. It's always day when moon is on same day side as sun. Inversely, this also means there are 2 weeks you cannot see moon during day, because it's on night side of ball. And, this is just not possible according to ball model logic. Therefore, since ball model is unable to come up with a single working explanation for how to circumvent the ½ year of moonless nights problem, we can say definitively this is 1 problem no baller can fix. This is a true 'glob-al' problem, if you may pardon my pun. It brings down the entire ball model. Causing it to break under the weight of its own lies. Collapses it dead. 0 resuscitation is possible.0 working alternative to Flat Earth is possible.0 counter to Flat Earth works. Flat Earth is all that works.Globe is dead. I'm going to say that again for those who didn't get it. The moon is visible every single night, including North and South with exception of new moon. This works perfectly on Flat Earth, where sun and moon rotate over Earth daily. Ball model has a max of 2 weeks day, 2 weeks night moon visibility, as sun is stationary relative to spinning Earth, so also stationary by extension to moon orbiting Earth. Moon orbits Earth, but it takes an entire month to do so while Earth rotates beneath. It's always day on day side of ball, and always night on night side. It takes 2 weeks for moon to cross 180° circle path over ball Earth on day side, and another 2 weeks covering the other 180° on night side of ball. This cannot work.Cannot be fixed. Moon absolutely does have to be visible more than ½ year, but cannot be on ball. It's dead. Flat Earth is all that works.@Goldie862 @RobinsHood @Eric-Dubay @goneflat @Lesane13 @NASA_Official",

Let's eliminate Earth frame of reference. <br /><br />What doesn't move, relative to moon?<br />The sun. <br /><br />Why the sun?<br />Sun is stationary, relative to Earth.<br />And, that makes it stationary relative to moon also, since moon rotates around Earth and with Earth. <br /><br />Since we now have a stationary frame of reference, and we know day and night on ball model do not come from sun and moon rotating ball, but ball Earth rotating into day and night with moon crawling a miserly 12° daily while ball Earth rotates below, we are now getting into the ball model's fatal and unfixable deadly flaw, that kills and eliminates ball as a 'working model' since there is no way to fix this glaring gaping hole in the model that does not conform to reality. <br /><br />We know from ball publications the moon has to be visible absolutely every single night, except new moons, even to North and South. <br /><br />This won't work on ball.<br />The reason it won't work, is ball has ½ ball always in daylight on day side, while the other ½ ball is always in night on night side. <br /><br />Even though ball model attempts to fix things by stating you rotate into day and night at 1,038 mph, causing day and night each 24 hr, what they are unable to fix is the moon. <br /><br />At 12° daily rotation around rotating Earth, this means the progression of the moon around the ball relative to stationary sun is going to take about 2 weeks on day side of ball. <br /><br />What this means is, ball can rotate all it wants at any speed it wants during these 2 weeks, but you'll never see the moon at night for ½ month or 2 weeks. <br /><br />It is impossible to see moon at night while it's on the same identical side as the sun. It's always day when moon is on same day side as sun. <br /><br />Inversely, this also means there are 2 weeks you cannot see moon during day, because it's on night side of ball. And, this is just not possible according to ball model logic. <br /><br />Therefore, since ball model is unable to come up with a single working explanation for how to circumvent the ½ year of moonless nights problem, we can say definitively this is 1 problem no baller can fix. <br /><br />This is a true 'glob-al' problem, if you may pardon my pun. It brings down the entire ball model. Causing it to break under the weight of its own lies. Collapses it dead. <br /><br />0 resuscitation is possible.<br />0 working alternative to Flat Earth is possible.<br />0 counter to Flat Earth works. <br /><br />Flat Earth is all that works.<br />Globe is dead. <br /><br />I'm going to say that again for those who didn't get it. <br /><br />The moon is visible every single night, including North and South with exception of new moon. This works perfectly on Flat Earth, where sun and moon rotate over Earth daily. <br /><br />Ball model has a max of 2 weeks day, 2 weeks night moon visibility, as sun is stationary relative to spinning Earth, so also stationary by extension to moon orbiting Earth. <br /><br />Moon orbits Earth, but it takes an entire month to do so while Earth rotates beneath. It's always day on day side of ball, and always night on night side. <br /><br />It takes 2 weeks for moon to cross 180° circle path over ball Earth on day side, and another 2 weeks covering the other 180° on night side of ball. <br /><br />This cannot work.<br />Cannot be fixed. <br /><br />Moon absolutely does have to be visible more than ½ year, but cannot be on ball. It's dead. <br /><br />Flat Earth is all that works.<br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/Goldie862\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Goldie862<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/RobinsHood\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@RobinsHood<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/Eric-Dubay\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Eric-Dubay<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/goneflat\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@goneflat<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/Lesane13\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Lesane13<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/NASA_Official\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@NASA_Official<\/a>",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",
