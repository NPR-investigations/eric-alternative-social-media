Soros Founded and Funded ERIC Is Now Used In 31 States<br /><br />Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia participate in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), which aims to \"improve the accuracy of America's voter rolls\", but in reality, it operates as more of a voter registration drive to generate a proprietary comprehensive database of everyone who could generate a legal ballot.<br /><br />Founded in 2012 by David Becker, an experienced Democrat election lawyer, each member state submits at a minimum its voter registration and motor vehicle licensee data.<br /><br />The data includes names, addresses, phone number, date-of-birth, last four digits of social security numbers, etc.<br /><br />Becker, who remains a board member of ERIC, went on to create the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) in 2016, which distributed $69.5 million in grants from Zuckerberg for the 2020 election.<br /><br />ERIC located 17 million new voters for the 2020 election, the most in the history of the organization. <br /><br />States are required by federal law (1993 NVRA) to report to Congress how many ineligible voters they removed from their voter rolls. These are the registrations of voters who fail to respond to an address confirmation request, and fail to vote in two consecutive elections.<br /><br />A report from Judicial Watch found that large counties (not participating in ERIC) have failed to clean their voter rolls over the last four years.  <br /><br />4 YEAR REPORTED TOTALS OF INELIGIBLE VOTERS REMOVED:<br />Sacramento: 1 million, removed 0.<br />Brooklyn: 1.7 million, removed 0.<br />Queens: 1.3 million, removed zero.<br />Fresno: 500,000, removed 2.<br />Bronx: 867,000, removed 1.<br />Contra Costa: 704,000, removed 1.<br />New York: 1.26 million, removed 2.<br />Nassau: 1.1 million, removed 0.<br /><br />Dirty voter rolls matter. <br /><br />A comprehensive, proprietary voter database funded by left-wing activist gives incredible power to those who oversee the process behind closed doors.<br /><br />Part 1:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/01/cleaning-voter-rolls-soros-founded-funded-eric-now-used-31-states/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2022/01/cleaning-voter-r<span class=\"invisible\">olls-soros-founded-funded-eric-now-used-31-states/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Part 2:<br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/01/eric-investigation-part-2-largest-u-s-counties-removed-zero-two-ineligible-voters-voter-rolls-4-years/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2022/01/eric-investigati<span class=\"invisible\">on-part-2-largest-u-s-counties-removed-zero-two-ineligible-voters-voter-rolls-4-years/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/KanekoaTheGreat\" class=\"u-url mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@KanekoaTheGreat<\/a>",

Trump and those working with him spread false information about the outcome of the presidential election and pressured state officials to overturn the results, potentially violating multiple federal laws, the panel said.“The Select Committee also has a good-faith basis for concluding that the President and members of his Campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States,” the committee wrote in a filing submitted in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California.The 221-page filing marks the committee’s most formal effort to link the former president to a federal crime, though the actual import of the filing is not clear. Lawmakers do not have the power to bring criminal charges on their own and can only make a referral to the Justice Department. The department has been investigating last year’s riot, but it has not given any indication that it is considering seeking charges against Trump.

          "contentraw": "Jan. 6 panel sees evidence of Trump ‘criminal conspiracy’<br />By FARNOUSH AMIRI, ERIC TUCKER and MARY CLARE JALONICK<br /><br />WASHINGTON (AP) — The House panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol said Wednesday for the first time that its evidence suggests crimes may have been committed by former President Donald Trump and his associates in the failed effort to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.<br /><br />Trump and his associates engaged in a “criminal conspiracy” to prevent Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in the Electoral College, the House committee said in a court filing. Trump and those working with him spread false information about the outcome of the presidential election and pressured state officials to overturn the results, potentially violating multiple federal laws, the panel said.<br /><br />“The Select Committee also has a good-faith basis for concluding that the President and members of his Campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States,” the committee wrote in a filing submitted in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California.<br /><br />The 221-page filing marks the committee’s most formal effort to link the former president to a federal crime, though the actual import of the filing is not clear. Lawmakers do not have the power to bring criminal charges on their own and can only make a referral to the Justice Department.

Consequently, Obama administration officials worked to assemble a new Ukrainian government friendly to the United States and therefore hostile to Russia.\n\nIn late February, the Russians responded to the American soft coup in Ukraine by invading Crimea and eventually annexing it and creating chaos in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn 2016, the Hillary Clinton campaign came calling on Ukrainian officials and activists to lend some Slavic authenticity to its Russia collusion narrative targeting Donald Trump.\n\nWith the CIA’s Brennan and a host of senior FBI and DOJ officials pushing Russiagate into the press—and running an illegal espionage campaign against the Trump team—Ukrainian political figures gladly joined in.\n\nKey participants included Kyiv’s ambassador to Washington, who wrote a Trump-Russia piece for the U.S. press, and a member of the Ukrainian parliament who allegedly contributed to the dossier.\n\nRussiagate was the kind of vanity project that a buffer state with a plunging GDP and an army equipped with 40-year-old ex-Soviet weapons in a notoriously risky area of the world can ill afford—especially one that lacked a nuclear arsenal.\n\nIn July 2019, U.S. national security officials injected yet another Ukraine-related narrative into the public sphere to target the American president.\n\nThis one appears to have been initiated by Ukrainian American White House official Alexander Vindman and his colleague Eric Ciaramella, a CIA analyst who had served as Vice President Biden’s point man on Ukraine.\n\nWhen Vindman told Ciaramella about a phone call in which Trump had asked the Ukrainian president for information regarding allegations about the Biden family’s corrupt activities in Kyiv, they called on help from U.S. intelligence services, the State Department, the Pentagon, Democratic Party officials, and the press.\n\nIn order to cover up for what the Bidens and perhaps other senior Obama officials had done in Ukraine, a Democratic Congress impeached Trump for trying to figure out what American policymakers had been doing in Ukraine over the past decade.\n\nThe end result was that the Ukrainians had helped weaken an American president who, unlike Obama, gave them arms to defend themselves against the Russians.\n\nMore seriously, they reinforced Putin’s view that, especially in partnership with the Democrats, Ukraine did not understand its true place in the world as a buffer state—and would continue to allow themselves to be used as an instrument by policymakers whose combination of narcissism and fecklessness made them particularly prone to dangerous miscalculations.\n\nhttps://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/ukraines-deadly-gamble\n\n@KanekoaTheGreat",
