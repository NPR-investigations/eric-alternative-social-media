Notwithstanding the definitions, anyone who is courteous is invited to post here. NOTICE THAT WE HAVE NO THREATS OF BANNING POSTED HERE & YOU ARE NOT LIMITED TO 3 POSTS / DAY.  But actual Bible discussion is much preferred here to posted links to YouTube sermons & advertisements.\n\nThere is a (private) dedicated Proof-Text Group for posting proof-texts to refute common Hairy Tick claims (like water baptism is essential for salvation).
