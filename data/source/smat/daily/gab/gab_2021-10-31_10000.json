We have also brought on a new moderator: @curiouserthantruth \r\n\r\nGod is good and His mercy endures forever!\r\n***\r\nBy posting you are agreeing to our posting standards. We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write your own description of the link/video even if the thumbnail has its own title/description) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

You probably aren’t surprised to learn that.<br /><br />It is not a partisan point to note that whatever else he may be Eric FARTwell IS LEGITIMATELY STUPID.<br /><br />Some of his colleagues have compared him to a Labrador with a head injury.<br /><br />That doesn’t seem quite fair. There is literally no chance Eric FARTwell could ever find a tennis ball.<br /><br />He can barely remember to breathe. Our enemies know just how dumb Eric FARTwell is and they have exploited it.<br /><br />If you are a marginally attractive Chinese spy, for example, hoping to commit bizarre sex acts with an American politician in order to steal this countries secrets sooner or later you would end up at FARTwell’s place because it is just too easy.<br /><br />This morning FARTwell was staring at the internet as he often is when he saw the picture of those fake Nazis in front of Glenn Younkin’s campaign bus in Virginia. Here is the amazing part.<br /><br />A normal person looking at this, someone with an IQ over 70 might have paused for a moment and wondered, that’s funny what is a black guy doing holding a torch at a white supremacy event.<br /><br />That seems weird. But that didn’t occur to Eric FARTwell. He didn’t wonder about it, it didn’t seem weird to him it all seemed perfectly normal.”<br /><br />Ouch !! 🤣 😆 😅",

It seems Giuseppe Ciaramella is likely related to Eric Ciaramella, the Ukraine impeachment whistleblower.  Giuseppe (Age 52) from Prospect, Connecticut and residing in Massachusetts, is related to Joseph Ciaramella (Age 57) who lives in Propect, CT (Same address).  Eric Ciaramella had the same address listed as a previous address before his online presence was scrubbed.  Giuseppe Ciaramella was the head of Moderna and worked at AstraZeneca and Pfizer.  He left Moderna suddenly according to a news report to work at an undisclosed \"stealth start up\".  That start up was Beam Therapeutics (registered in CT with operations in Mass).  This is too bizarre to even fathom...significant or coincidence?  Who the hell knows?",

Greitens is a former Democrat born and raised in St. Louis, arguably the most liberal city in the state. He jumped to the Republican party in 2015, was elected governor in 2016, and took office in 2017 but his administration was scandalized by an affair he had and charges of invasion of privacy. Some lawyers associated with him were investigated by a grand jury. Although no indictments were made, Greitens eventually resigned. I would rather vote for Billy Long, with whom I was at first unsure but have had email contact with his office which has sent me detailed and satisfactory responses to my concerns. Long seems to be the odds-on frontrunner as well. An even more ideal candidate would be MO AG Eric Schmitt who, although not as likely to win, is from all indications a solid constitutional conservative.",

The jab almost crippled/killed him and now Antifa wants to finish the job. This list is the best evidence that Antifa is a controlled opposition group; all of the people on the list are against using state violence to force injections of mega-corporation experimental \"therapies\". The real anti-fascists I know are all raging against the corporate coup of nation-states and the jab mandates. It's also very telling the author acknowledges the only reason he isn't calling for violence is because it's illegal, not because it is morally and ethically wrong to initiate violence against people who think differently. This Antifa \"organizer\" is a coercive collectivist statist literally targeting people who are opposing facism. The doublethink is so thick I'm surprised he can think at all.",

Murphy: FDA Adviser’s Remark on COVID-19 Jab for Kids ‘The Most Dangerous Statement I’ve Ever Heard in Medicine’<br />BY ZACHARY STIEBER October 30, 2021 Updated: October 31, 2021<br /><br />Dr. Eric Rubin, editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, and an associate physician specializing in infectious disease at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, sits on the administration’s vaccine advisory panel.<br /><br />Before the panel voted this week to advise the FDA to authorize Pfizer’s COVID-19 jab for kids 5 to 11, Rubin said, in part: <br />    “We’re never going to learn about how safe this vaccine is unless we start giving it. <br />     That’s just the way it goes. That’s how we found out about rare complications of other <br />     vaccines, like the rotavirus vaccine.”<br /><br />“That is literally the most dangerous statement I’ve ever heard in medicine,” Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.), a doctor, said on NTD’s “Capitol Report.”",

Weinstein goes on to say that \"every single rabbi I know says that they don't actually believe in the Jewish God of the old testament. How can this be if Judaism is a religion?\"Rabbi Wolpe replies by saying that \"Judaism is NOT a religion.\"He says Christianity is a religion because ....\"If tomorrow I believe in Jesus, I'm Christian. If the day after I don't, I'm not. But If a Jew stops believing in the Jewish religious beliefs, he is still Jewish.\" So what are the Jewish people? Now Rabbi Wolpe has to talk in code, because it's politically forbidden to admit that Jews are a race. Rabbi Wolpe says \"I would use the word \"tribe\" but \"tribe\" has negative connotations\".So he does believe they are a \"tribe\", but he can't say that because it's politically incorrect.Ultimately Rabbi Wolpe says that the Jewish people are a \"religious family\". Of course, scientifically speaking, a racial group is basically a large extended family group.Eric Weinstein goes on to say that ....\"Judaism is effectively a breeding protocol....There's a very strange moment when you sign up for '23 and Me'...and you get a DNA test result that tells you how Jewish you are\"(at 12 min) https://youtu.be/3mSxiFUzZ-Q?t=718",

The White House confirmed the list to Fox News.<br /><br />The long list of top administration officials in attendance reflects the high priority Biden has put on his climate policy.<br /><br />\"The existential threat to humanity is climate change,\" Biden said in a recent tweet. \"In a few days, I am headed to @COP26 in Glasgow to demonstrate a commitment to the world that we will get to a net-zero emissions economy no later than 2050.\"<br /><br />The eight members who will attend represent a third of Biden's Cabinet.

With few exceptions, welfare becomes a generational problem as families who become dependents of government remain dependents of government.There are ways to properly assist those in need without locking them into the welfare state. Jobs programs, education programs, and temporary relief funds can help people get a leg up from their circumstances, but Democrats know these types of programs do not accomplish the singular goal of the welfare state: Buying votes from those stuck in a perpetual poverty status.To this end, universal basic income pilot programs have been launched in Chicago and Los Angeles. According to Fox32 in Chicago:Los Angeles will pay $1000 to 3,200 families every month, while Chicago will send $500 to 5000 families. The programs will cost $40 million and $31.5 million, respectively, according to FOX Business reporter Grady Trimble.Applicants for the Chicago program will be chosen at random but must earn less than $35,000 a year to qualify.Mayors Eric Garcetti and Lori Lightfoot have hailed the programs as the necessary step to “lift” people out of poverty, but critics have targeted the programs as an example of policies that disincentivize work amid a labor shortage.Of all the times in American history when a UBI program is ludicrous, this is the worst. There is no shortage of jobs that need people to work them. UBI incentivizes people to remain below the income threshold so as not to lose their “free” money.

Companies like Standard Oil of New Jersey provided oil products to both sides.Only recently in the National Archives, thanks to Journalist John Buchanon, documents were uncovered that the father of the first Bush was convicted for Trading With The Enemy and lost large sums of money as fines BUT WAS NEVER EXECUTED AS A SPY.The History books never knew that that Bush and his son, George HW Bush, were actually spies for Nazi Germany taking on assumed identities in the United States never to this day admitting their Nazi Germany citizenship. <br /><br />The Nazis that infiltrated the White House were honoring their man. His brother, Allen Dulles, was head of the Nazi CIA combo for a number of years. Supreme Court Justice Goldberg said what they did made them traitors.Only recently an associate of Hitler and Bush in Nazi Germany during the 1930’s, Otto Skorenzy,rolled out his collection of SIXTY PHOTOS to tell Journalist Eric Orion how Bush I, Barbara Bush, and his father, Prescott Bush (GERMAN NAMES George Scherf and George Scherf, Jr.) were born and bred in Nazi Germany and worked for Germany interests in America. The destruction of America since WWII lies at their footsteps.Using the Otto’s 60 photos of Hitler and the Scherf’s and other names that made the History books like Megele, Bormann, No. 2 to Hitler, Gehlen, all associates of the Scherfs in the 1930’s, as the basis of our investigation we will tell tell THE NAZIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE STORY.",

The White House confirmed the list to Fox News.<br /><br />The long list of top administration officials in attendance reflects the high priority Biden has put on his climate policy. <br /><br />President Biden speaks at a meeting with business leaders and CEOs on the COVID-19 response in the library of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 15, 2021. Biden will be at the Glasgow climate summit that starts on Sunday. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)<br /><br />\"The existential threat to humanity is climate change,\" Biden said in a recent tweet. \"In a few days, I am headed to @COP26 in Glasgow to demonstrate a commitment to the world that we will get to a net-zero emissions economy no later than 2050.\"<br /><br />The eight members who will attend represent a third of Biden's Cabinet. At the conference will be six of the 16 members of the presidential line of succession, not counting the president himself. <br /><br />The first, second and third people in the line of succession remain in the U.S., so the most important people for the continuity of government remain on American soil. They are Vice President Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. <br /><br />While senior officials attend the conference, significant domestic problems continue.<br /><br />Read @<br /><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cabinet-white-house-glasgow-climate-summit\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>foxnews.com/politics/biden-cabinet-white-hous<span class=\"invisible\">e-glasgow-climate-summit<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

News’ “perspectives” collages.<br /><br />This is about Joe Biden’s “6uild 6ack 6etter” spending bill, which is now only a mere $1.75 trillion.<br /><br />Yahoo! News:<br /><br />Optimists<br /><br />Despite the cuts, the bill is still enormous<br /><br />“I think it’s fair to say many of the compromises along the way are going to make the legislation both materially and politically worse and less popular. But it also is the case that a $1.75 trillion package is a lot.” — Chris Hayes, MSNBC<br /><br />It would be a mistake to overlook the all the great things in the bill<br /><br />“Democrats have the chance to pass and sign into law transformational investments in the nation’s human and physical infrastructure. They should go ahead and get it done — and then they should stop focusing on what had to be left out of these spending packages and begin loudly celebrating all that is included.” — Eugene Robinson, Washington Post<br /><br />It’s remarkable how much Democrats have accomplished with zero room for error<br /><br />“All of these reforms come on top of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. … Taken together — including a few hundred billion dollars of public investment in domestic infrastructure and manufacturing across Biden’s bipartisan bills — and you have a pretty solid haul for a Democratic trifecta that barely exists.” — Eric Levitz, New York<br /><br />A trimmed-down bill is a better fit for the current economic situation<br /><br />“The U.S. economy has changed dramatically in the last nine months — and so have the political and policy implications of the Build Back Better plan. Viewed in this context, Sinema and Manchin aren’t stifling the Democratic agenda so much as saving it from overreach. For that, Democrats should be grateful.” — Karl W. Smith, Bloomberg<br /><br />The bill’s climate spending makes up for its other shortcomings<br /><br />“While details continue to emerge and negotiations are ongoing, it seems we’re ending up with a shockingly good climate bill attached to a somewhat depressing everything else bill.” — Jordan Weissman, Slate<br /><br />Conservatives can take some solace that the bill has shrunk substantially<br /><br />“From a conservative standpoint, nothing good was ever going to come out of a massive reconciliation bill passed by President Biden and congressional Democrats. All along, the only question was how bad the final legislation was going to be.” — Philip Klein, National Review<br /><br />Critics<br /><br />Democrats are making a huge political mistake by cutting down the bill<br /><br />...(cont/)<br /><br /><a href=\"https://dailystormer.su/joe-bidens-new-1-75-trillion-dollar-6uild-6ack-6etter-bill-simply-isnt-big-enough/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>dailystormer.su/joe-bidens-new-1-75-trillion-<span class=\"invisible\">dollar-6uild-6ack-6etter-bill-simply-isnt-big-enough/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br /><a href=\"/tags/Dailystormer\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Dailystormer<\/a>",
