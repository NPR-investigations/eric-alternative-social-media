Ashwagandha has helped many people feel calmer and like they can cope with stress easier.Ashwagandha helps control the HPA axis, which is the communication between your hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals. These hormonal communications help the body adapt to a stress response.Once the communication is complete, the hormone is supposed to lower back down, but with chronic stress, cortisol never goes back down and is chronically elevated. Ashwagandha can help reduce these hormones.Cortisol isn‚Äôt a bad thing. It doesn‚Äôt cause stress‚Äîit‚Äôs adapting your body to a stress state. But, it‚Äôs not healthy to have your body in a state of chronic stress and chronically elevated cortisol.Potential benefits of ashwagandha: ‚Ä¢ It helps lower cortisol in the AM ‚Ä¢ It helps lower DHEA (a precursor to cortisol) in the AM ‚Ä¢ It helps raise testosterone (stress lowers testosterone) ‚Ä¢ It helps increase endurance  ‚Ä¢ It helps increase strength (stress may cause weakness) ‚Ä¢ It has shown significant improvements in emotions ****Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.

[They may even have to disassemble the entire Gantry Tower and check all the hydrogen feed pipes and connections if they don‚Äôt find the rubber gasket in the First Stage Lines]<br /><br />Remember ‚Ä¶ the ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòO-Ring‚Äô!<br /><br />And all this ‚Ä¶ for what?<br /><br />To send a Black woman to die by crashing on the Moon, just because ‚Ä¶ it seemed like a good idea.
