Never freaking give up! Wow, what an incredible race!! Wow, what an incredible ride!!!🏆 Rich Strike wins $1.86Million. 🏆 Entered the race yesterday 30 seconds before the deadline.  🏆 Only got in the race because the 20th horse had to scratch yesterday. 🏆 Started from the worst post position on the outside of the track. 🏆 Had to make his way through the field of 19 other horses from the back. 🏆 His race career; 7 starts, one win. 🏆 His jockey, Sonny Leon, had never been to the Kentucky Derby. 🏆 His trainer, Eric Reed, has never raced a horse in the Kentucky Derby. 🏆 Eric Reed tragically lost nearly two dozen race horses in a barn fire a few years ago and struggled with quitting. 🏆 Eric Reed lost his two assistant trainers last year to cancer. 🏆 Rich Strike was purchased in a claiming race last fall for only $30,000. 🏆 80-1 odds.This horse had no idea he was a long shot. He had no idea that he was entered last minute, because another horse scratched. He had no idea that his trainer and jockey had never won the Kentucky Derby. So he ran…and WON! He even had enough left after a mile and a quarter to give hell to the pony horse!  Congratulations to Rich Strike and all of his people.Rich Strike wins the 148th Kentucky Derby!! What an incredible success story!!!Never give up on your dreams!!!",
          "contentraw": "Tracy Kirby<br /><br />🏆🐎Great. background info on Rich Strike, the 148th Kentucky Derby winner!<br />***********************************<br />I believe that God sent 'this' horse to run 'this' race to encourage us all to never give up...even if you think you can't do it, even if people say you can't do it and don't believe in you!  Never freaking give up! <br />Wow, what an incredible race!! <br />Wow, what an incredible ride!!!<br />🏆 Rich Strike wins $1.86Million. <br />🏆 Entered the race yesterday 30 seconds before the deadline.  <br />🏆 Only got in the race because the 20th horse had to scratch yesterday. <br />🏆 Started from the worst post position on the outside of the track. <br />🏆 Had to make his way through the field of 19 other horses from the back. <br />🏆 His race career; 7 starts, one win. <br />🏆 His jockey, Sonny Leon, had never been to the Kentucky Derby. <br />🏆 His trainer, Eric Reed, has never raced a horse in the Kentucky Derby. <br />🏆 Eric Reed tragically lost nearly two dozen race horses in a barn fire a few years ago and struggled with quitting. <br />🏆 Eric Reed lost his two assistant trainers last year to cancer. <br />🏆 Rich Strike was purchased in a claiming race last fall for only $30,000. <br />🏆 80-1 odds.<br />This horse had no idea he was a long shot. He had no idea that he was entered last minute, because another horse scratched. He had no idea that his trainer and jockey had never won the Kentucky Derby. So he ran…and WON! He even had enough left after a mile and a quarter to give hell to the pony horse!  Congratulations to Rich Strike and all of his people.<br />Rich Strike wins the 148th Kentucky Derby!! <br />What an incredible success story!!!<br />Never give up on your dreams!!!",

The lawsuit accuses them of colluding with social media to ‘censor and suppress free speech.’ According to the plaintiffs, these officials cooperated with Meta (recognized as an extremist in the Russian Federation and banned), Twitter and YouTube to prevent the dissemination of ‘truthful information related to COVID-19, the issue of election integrity and other topics.’‘Missourians and Americans, in general, use social media, which is ubiquitous in modern society, to discuss topics such as the effectiveness of wearing masks and theories about the leakage from the laboratory.

Extremely important update:    We’ve received numerous reports of widespread censorship of posts about 2000 Mules across major social media platforms.    Our website to help citizens engage in democracy and clean up the voter databases has been fully blacklisted on Facebook.    Instagram has reportedly been blacking out images from our premiere with POTUS 45 in Mar a Lago.    TikTok is flagging accounts distributing video clips of last night’s premiere in Vegas for “inciting violence”.    Twitter is shutting down accounts.    Rumble came under “unprecedented attacks” trying to prevent the stream of the video.

You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of. If you find that you’re not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again.” ― Eric Roth“The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our Attitudes.”― Charles R. SwindollThe one thing WE The People need more than anything else is solidarity. I've promoted patriotic synergy for the past 16 years. People need to see that as a positive action they themselves can promote daily.",
