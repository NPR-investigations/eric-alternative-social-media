Divine Love is the essence, the heart of the creation. For you, it is vital to learn to live in that heart. The heart space is within your physical form is a channel, directly connecting you with the essential Divine Love energy of all of Creation, with the heart of the creative Godhead Itself. As you bring Spirit into the physical, you will find that the heart is your center and the place you live from. It is the place you can operate from most effectively here in the physical form on this transforming planet. Until you can bring that compassionate Divine Love into play, or shall I say allow it to come into play, you will not be complete; you will not be as effective a Lightworker. As the denser energies are removed and transmuted from your being, as you learn to ground Spirit into the physical, all of your spiritual centers, your chakras, will be aligned and balanced. You will find the heart center to be that which balances all. And your Spirit, your divine Self, can anchor within that heart center and fill you with a great deal more Presence, a great deal more of your own divinity, than if you were to only keep it in the mind or in the physic centers.
