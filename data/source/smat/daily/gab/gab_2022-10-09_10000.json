The complaint charges that Eric Tistounet, chief of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) staff, has systematically harassed, censored, and discriminated against UN Watch over a course of at least 15 years. Mr. Tistounet’s conduct, UN Watch alleges, is in violation of the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, as well as of UN staff rules, procedures, and practices.       In addition, UN Watch has brought high profile dissidents to address the Human Rights Council, from China, Cuba, Russia and elsewhere. Various dictatorial regimes have in turn pressured Tistounet’s office for help, which obliged. For example, Tistounet has been accused of putting in place a UN policy of handing over to China in advance the names of dissidents registered to speak at the UNHRC.       Eric Tistounet has appeared to be obsessed with silencing UN Watch’s voice and with what looks like his personal vendetta against UN Watch’s executive director, Hillel Neuer. He has acted like Captain Ahab, who relentlessly pursued Moby Dick. But instead of using a harpoon to try and destroy his foe as Captain Ahab did, Tistounet allegedly abused his considerable power to censor UN Watch, smear Mr. Neuer, and insulate the UNHRC from any legitimate criticism.",

Greg Abbott has sent more than 2,500 migrants to Chicago. While city and state leaders initiated a rapid response to situate the migrants, immigration activists and organizations still feel that efforts to shore up social services amount to emergency triage, not long-term solutions.The city has nearly 829,000 noncitizens who are potentially at risk of deportation, according to 2016 data from the Vera Institute of Justice, a criminal justice nonprofit.There is still a lack of housing and a complicated, long process for work permits has created an existing class of vulnerable undocumented people who are having to double and triple up in apartments and work illegally.In August, Chicago became the latest U.S. city to receive bused migrants, following similar arrivals in Washington, D.C., and New York City.Those cities quickly became overburdened by the surprise inflow from Texas. On Friday, New York Mayor Eric Adams declared a city emergency over the “humanitarian crisis” of thousands of asylum-seekers coming to the city and slammed Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for exacerbating the issue.Even though Chicago had some time to prepare, there was still “disarray” as buses arrived, said Sylvia Puente, president and CEO of the Latino Policy Forum, a nonprofit that works on public policy for Latinos in Chicago and Illinois.",

While city and state leaders initiated a rapid response to situate the migrants, immigration activists and organizations still feel that efforts to shore up social services amount to emergency triage, not long-term solutions.<br /><br />The city has nearly 829,000 noncitizens who are potentially at risk of deportation, according to 2016 data from the Vera Institute of Justice, a criminal justice nonprofit.<br /><br />There is still a lack of housing and a complicated, long process for work permits has created an existing class of vulnerable undocumented people who are having to double and triple up in apartments and work illegally.<br /><br />In August, Chicago became the latest U.S. city to receive bused migrants, following similar arrivals in Washington, D.C., and New York City.<br /><br />Those cities quickly became overburdened by the surprise inflow from Texas. On Friday, New York Mayor Eric Adams declared a city emergency over the “humanitarian crisis” of thousands of asylum-seekers coming to the city and slammed Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for exacerbating the issue.<br /><br />Even though Chicago had some time to prepare, there was still “disarray” as buses arrived, said Sylvia Puente, president and CEO of the Latino Policy Forum, a nonprofit that works on public policy for Latinos in Chicago and Illinois.",

The servant abides not in the house for ever: but the Son abides ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” (John 8:34-36)I know the message of the Gospel has been polluted, I realize the words of our Lord are not popular. But friend, Jesus is the truth, he spoke the truth, lived the truth. We need to pay heed to the Lord when he speaks. We cannot play games with sin, why? Look at the what Jesus says, “He who sins, is servant to sin.” (John 8:34-36)Whether or not we choose to accept it or not, all of us at one time were slaves. Slaves to our thoughts, words and actions. Some of us are paying for the choices to this day, for the sins we commit back them.Sin is a cruel master, 1 night of pleasure can produce an STD, that can destroy you physically. 1 drink can make you an alcoholic damaging your internal organs, that will eventually cause your death. 1 snort of cocaine can make you an addict, destroying your mind and body. Sin always has a price, and of course dying without repentance will destroy your soul.Jesus paid that price for us, who will believe in him, repent of our sin, and come to him. This world may not forgive you, but trust me, when you truly come to Jesus, in the faith God provides, your ultimate forgiveness is guaranteed. Not because you deserve it, I know for sure I do not deserve it. But because God is Merciful, God is Gracious, and his son, (All Glory be to him) dies to set us free.There was a video I reposted from Eric Ludy, a few months back, I will include the link at the bottom.He points out, God just didn’t deal with the penalty of sin, he dealt with the problem of sin, He dealt with power of Sin. I urge you to watch it.You see, God loves us so much he gave, I want you to notice that, HE GAVE, his only son, that whosoever believes in him, shall not perish but will have eternal life.God is waiting for his children to deny sin, and draw to him.I ask you to watch the video, and enjoy, knowing that you are Loved, you are Forgiven, you are fill with the Grace of God.https://www.bitchute.com/video/ApI2EdSOd7Zw/Enjoy.",

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

But friend, Jesus is the truth, he spoke the truth, lived the truth. We need to pay heed to the Lord when he speaks. We cannot play games with sin, why? Look at the what Jesus says, “He who sins, is servant to sin.” (John 8:34-36)<br />Whether or not we choose to accept it or not, all of us at one time were slaves. Slaves to our thoughts, words and actions. Some of us are paying for the choices to this day, for the sins we commit back them.<br />Sin is a cruel master, 1 night of pleasure can produce an STD, that can destroy you physically. 1 drink can make you an alcoholic damaging your internal organs, that will eventually cause your death. 1 snort of cocaine can make you an addict, destroying your mind and body. Sin always has a price, and of course dying without repentance will destroy your soul.<br />Jesus paid that price for us, who will believe in him, repent of our sin, and come to him. This world may not forgive you, but trust me, when you truly come to Jesus, in the faith God provides, your ultimate forgiveness is guaranteed. Not because you deserve it, I know for sure I do not deserve it. But because God is Merciful, God is Gracious, and his son, (All Glory be to him) dies to set us free.<br />There was a video I reposted from Eric Ludy, a few months back, I will include the link at the bottom.<br />He points out, God just didn’t deal with the penalty of sin, he dealt with the problem of sin, He dealt with power of Sin.

Look at the what Jesus says, “He who sins, is servant to sin.” (John 8:34-36)<br />Whether or not we choose to accept it or not, all of us at one time were slaves. Slaves to our thoughts, words and actions. Some of us are paying for the choices to this day, for the sins we commit back them.<br />Sin is a cruel master, 1 night of pleasure can produce an STD, that can destroy you physically. 1 drink can make you an alcoholic damaging your internal organs, that will eventually cause your death. 1 snort of cocaine can make you an addict, destroying your mind and body. Sin always has a price, and of course dying without repentance will destroy your soul.<br />Jesus paid that price for us, who will believe in him, repent of our sin, and come to him. This world may not forgive you, but trust me, when you truly come to Jesus, in the faith God provides, your ultimate forgiveness is guaranteed. Not because you deserve it, I know for sure I do not deserve it. But because God is Merciful, God is Gracious, and his son, (All Glory be to him) dies to set us free.<br />There was a video I reposted from Eric Ludy, a few months back, I will include the link at the bottom.<br />He points out, God just didn’t deal with the penalty of sin, he dealt with the problem of sin, He dealt with power of Sin. I urge you to watch it.<br />You see, God loves us so much he gave, I want you to notice that, HE GAVE, his only son, that whosoever believes in him, shall not perish but will have eternal life.<br />God is waiting for his children to deny sin, and draw to him.<br />I ask you to watch the video, and enjoy, knowing that you are Loved, you are Forgiven, you are fill with the Grace of God.<br /><a href=\"https://www.bitchute.com/video/ApI2EdSOd7Zw/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>bitchute.com/video/ApI2EdSOd7Zw/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Enjoy....",

Florida has sent 48 illegal immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard where former President Barack Obama bought a mansion in 2019.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused illegal immigrants from Texas to a location near Harris’s D.C. residence after the vice president said the border is secure.New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, declared an “asylum seeker state of emergency” on Friday citing the surge in the inflow of bused illegal immigrants from other states.Adams called the federal and state government to grant emergency aid to handle the continued influx of asylum seekers, which cost the city $1 billion this fiscal year.“With more than 17,000 asylum seekers bussed to the city since the spring, the Adams administration estimates that once the asylum seekers from today’s buses are provided shelter, the city will surpass the highest number of people in recorded history in its shelter system,” the city hall said in a statement. “If the pace continues, the city’s shelter census will surpass 100,000 in the coming year.”https://www.theepochtimes.com/contract-suggests-florida-to-continue-relocating-illegal-immigrants-for-months_4784154.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",

His European Renaissance is flailing. Eurozone inflation is at 10 per cent. Macron’s failure to win control of the National Assembly after his own reelection this year has derailed his legislative program, including pension reform, its centrepiece. Germany has turned out to be a catastrophic best friend, Merkel disappearing in a puff of smoke leaving energy chaos behind her. And now the Italians have voted to install a popular conservative, a friend of Eric Zemmour no less, who has no illusions whatsoever about France.‘I will not comment on the democratic choice of the Italian people,’ Macron’s prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, sniffed this week. Graciously congratulating the new Italian government on its election victory was apparently too difficult for her. The PM defended the role of Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, who warned the new Italian government to obey EU rules or face sanctions.Meloni knows she has to talk to Paris‘The subject is naturally a concern of President Macron,’ emphasised one counsellor. ‘The prospect of seeing a representative of the extreme right come to power is undoubtedly very worrying,’ Macron’s former European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau told L'Express.Meloni is a conservative but extreme right is a term with a flexible definition. Friends in Rome tell me she is serious, smart, and often likely to be the grownup in the room. She is Zemmourian in her respect for the values of families and Christianity. She’s incidentally resolute in her support for Ukraine, and while some might laugh at her for her working class accent, she can hardly be blamed for the degradation of Franco-Italian relations, which have been disastrous since Nicolas Sarkozy persuaded the US and the UK to join the hare-brained 2011 invasion of Libya, which has caused chaos in the Mediterranean basin ever since, with Italy picking up the pieces.Videos are surfacing in which Meloni shows herself perfectly capable of standing up for Italy, and sticking the knife in France.She’s also infuriated the French by questioning their lamentable record in francophone Africa where they control the currency, not necessarily to the benefit of their para-colonial dependencies, and about uranium mining in Niger, which fuels the French nuclear electricity grid, while the local population lives in abject poverty.This is all fodder for political journalists but what it means might be less than meets the eye. Macron is a great seducer and his initial forays against Meloni might be regarded as flirtatious. Meloni knows she has to talk to Paris. She has made another video, less well publicised, in which, speaking French, she carefully explains her political project, and dismisses all suggestion that it is extremist.Macron still talks to Orban, despite the noise. But the relationship with Italy will now not be as one-sided as the one to which the French were accustomed. Italy is not an ally that France can simply take for granted in a multi-polar EU under energy, security and economic stress. Macron has a suddenly startling absence of good friends in Europe, just as his difficulties at home are converging to produce a very tricky political season.https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/is-meloni-s-rise-bad-for-macron-",
