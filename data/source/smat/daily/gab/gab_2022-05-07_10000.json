This request pertained to an OSTP “event on countering climate change denial and delay” in which the Office brought in political activists to discuss, e.g., social science which might explain political opposition to their demands. See, e.g., Maxine Joselow, “White House schedules first event on countering climate change denial and delay,” Washington Post, February 24, 2022. …The requested records will inform the public of high-profile ethics revelations at OSTP and media coverage thereof, and also the genesis of a tendentious event and campaign out of OSTP.

So why am I mentioning it? For two reasons. First, because it made me smile to think that when we as a family moved to England in 1967, it was in Ilkley that my parents chose to make our home. My sisters and I were to enjoy all the benefits of such a lovely place. But secondly, because the idea of Ilkley or anywhere offering “everything you need” must be challenged.It made me think of a passage in “The Weight of Glory” where C .S. Lewis addresses this desire for our own far-off country. Books, music, and places are images of our longings, but, he writes, “they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.” This human experience is surely heightened in the Christian, since “our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ” (Phil. 3:20).Years ago, Eric Alexander reminded a group of young ministers, “There is no ideal place to serve God except the place he sets you down.” For me this has been Cleveland, Ohio, where I continue to enjoy the immense privilege of being part of a loving, long-suffering congregation while surrounded and supported by a team of elders and pastors who know the worst about me and love me just the same.It changes everything when we realize that this is true for all of us. Where we live and work is under the overruling hand of God, who loves us with an everlasting love.

God is good and His mercy endures forever!\n***\nBy posting you are agreeing to our posting standards, and anything that violates them will be removed.\n***\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\n***\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \n***\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\n3. Low effort (a link without adequate description of what we will find when clicking said link; and, no, a sentence is rarely sufficient) or multiple posts in a row (any more than one post in a 3 hour time period results in the keeping of the most recent post and removal of the older until the time period is met)\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\n7. All members who block the administrators will be removed.\n***\nRemember that we are the body of Christ.

We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: &quot;Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT<\/p><br /><hr><br /><p>PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:<br />Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):<\/p><ol><li>Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.<br /><\/li><li>Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how.

This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else&#39;s well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:<br /><\/li><li>Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts<br /><\/li><li>Low effort (a link without adequate description of what we will find when clicking said link; and, no, a sentence is rarely sufficient) or multiple posts in a row (any more than one post in a 3 hour time period results in the keeping of the most recent post and removal of the older until the time period is met)<br /><\/li><li>Posts that don&#39;t meet the criteria mentioned above<br /><\/li><li>Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.<br /><\/li><li>Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)<br /><\/li><li>All members who block the administrators will be removed.<br />***<br />Remember that we are the body of Christ.
