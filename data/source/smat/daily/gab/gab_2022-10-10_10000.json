There, the veteran cop finds nailing a jelly to the wall far easier than stopping a merc’ on a mission.\r\nIn the predator’s cross-hairs are the most sinister but successful sinners of Liverpool’s underworld. ‘Mess with the best, die like the rest’ appears to be Jack Scarlett’s maxim as after being crossed in love and trust he evens the score.\r\nThe killer question is, can Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen stop Jack Scarlett, and does he really want to. That is for you to decide.",

We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",

These were mostly Black and White.\nWhen the families moved to better school districts it left the liberal cities a void.\nThat void was filled with illegal aliens.\nThis created inequalities and segregation. \nIt also led to drive-by-shootings and violence in the schools. \nGang wars pitted the immigrants against one another and blacks.\nTeachers wouldn't teach in violent cities and left those kids to be educated by subpar teachers.\n\nClimate alarmism was created by the United Nations and introduced to congress by Nancy Pelosi in 1992 as Agenda 21.\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/353\nThe United Nations wants to be unelected global leaders with open borders.\nPelosi made her open borders stance clear when in 2016 she flew to Mexico City and got former\nMexico President Vicente Fox to declare Trump voters as \"lazy drunks\".\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/pelosi-vicente-fox-plot-to-defeat-trump-mexican-calls-trump-voters-lazy-drunks\n\nCalifornia's Governor Newsom within a week after defending his recall, made a law by decree that every neighborhood would have to provide affordable housing. With low income high density housing comes public transportation, light rail, dedicated bus lanes, bicycle trails, removing lanes from streets.\n\nAgenda 21 envisioned returning land back to nature, which explains Obama's and Biden's land grab. \n\nObama:\nSince taking office, I’ve set aside more than 260 million acres of public lands and waters — more than any President in history.\nhttp://news.investors.com/politics-andrew-malcolm/102415-777311-obama-protecting-the-land-is-important.htm\n\nUnder guise of climate change, Biden wants to make 30% of U.S. land off limits Expanded government plan means he's coming for private property\nhttps://www.wnd.com/2021/09/biden-plan-means-coming-private-property-wants-make-30-us-land-off-limits/\n",

Buck says, \"We need a whole different mentality than what libs have brought to the table on crime. Top to bottom.\" Mexican cartels will make $13 billion illegally smuggling people into the United States this year. Putting that number into perspective Clay noted that’s more than the NFL, MLB or NBA made last season. How can the U.S. spend billions securing Ukraine’s border, but not its own? A 32-year-old illegal alien stabbed eight people, killing two on Las Vegas Strip. Crime, illegal immigration and economy are the three things Republicans need to focus on. But what's possible they might make their big issue instead? Clay says, \"Ukraine has become the new new thing for left-wingers. That's what they're obsessed with. That's what they're focused on.\"Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show H2 – Oct 10 2022: https://chtbl.com/track/5899E/podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/arttrk.com/p/D5CA5/pdst.fm/e/traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/e73c998e-6e60-432f-8610-ae210140c5b1/57c236de-aec0-46c1-b141-ae3c00026d77/deb279f1-922c-44a7-99a3-af2a0135f924/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&amp;in_playlist=1776c4cc-50a1-410f-a2de-ae3c00026dfaDr. Mehmet Oz, Senate candidate for Pennsylvania, joins Clay and Buck to discuss his plans to crack down on crime, illegal immigration, and focus on the economy. Why won’t John Fetterman debate Dr. Oz? Larry Summers: \"More likely than not\" we’ll have a recession in the next 12-18 months. Kelly Tshibaka, Senate candidate for Alaska, talks with C&amp;B about ranked choice voting, how her RINO opponent, Lisa Murkowski, has gotten increasingly liberal over her 21 years in the Senate, is now a key Biden ally, and is completely out of step with Alaskans.

Key Russian infrastructure has been destroyed. Why is American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten traveling to Ukraine? Covid vaccine madness continues.

Buck says, \"We need a whole different mentality than what libs have brought to the table on crime. Top to bottom.\" Mexican cartels will make $13 billion illegally smuggling people into the United States this year. Putting that number into perspective Clay noted that’s more than the NFL, MLB or NBA made last season. How can the U.S. spend billions securing Ukraine’s border, but not its own? A 32-year-old illegal alien stabbed eight people, killing two on Las Vegas Strip. Crime, illegal immigration and economy are the three things Republicans need to focus on. But what's possible they might make their big issue instead? Clay says, \"Ukraine has become the new new thing for left-wingers. That's what they're obsessed with. That's what they're focused on.\"<br /><br />Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show H2 – Oct 10 2022: <a href=\"https://chtbl.com/track/5899E/podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/arttrk.com/p/D5CA5/pdst.fm/e/traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/e73c998e-6e60-432f-8610-ae210140c5b1/57c236de-aec0-46c1-b141-ae3c00026d77/deb279f1-922c-44a7-99a3-af2a0135f924/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&amp;in_playlist=1776c4cc-50a1-410f-a2de-ae3c00026dfa\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>chtbl.com/track/5899E/podtrac.com/pts/redirec<span class=\"invisible\">t.mp3/arttrk.com/p/D5CA5/pdst.fm/e/traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/e73c998e-6e60-432f-8610-ae210140c5b1/57c236de-aec0-46c1-b141-ae3c00026d77/deb279f1-922c-44a7-99a3-af2a0135f924/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&amp;in_playlist=1776c4cc-50a1-410f-a2de-ae3c00026dfa<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />Dr. Mehmet Oz, Senate candidate for Pennsylvania, joins Clay and Buck to discuss his plans to crack down on crime, illegal immigration, and focus on the economy.

          "content": "Twice as many unarmed white people are killed by cops as unarmed black people. Yet, how often has the police killing an unarmed white person become a national news story? How many times has it spurred an international movement? The answer is none.Every single death of a white person at the hands of a police officer goes unnoticed in the media, on the internet, and in our society, whereas the police shootings of unarmed black people create major news stories. We know all the names; George Floyd, Michael Brown, Philando Castile, Jacob Blake, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Laquan McDonald, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Alton Sterling, Sandra Bland, and Breanna Taylor. We don’t know the name of one unarmed white person who has been killed by a police officer. Because no one cares when an unarmed white person is killed. No one. If they did, then we would be able to come up with one name, but we can’t because there is zero media coverage. There hasn’t been one unarmed innocent white person shot and killed by the police? Is it automatically assumed by the media that the white person who got shot by the cops deserved it, while the black person who got shot by the cops was an innocent victim? Nobody thinks about all those white people killed by cops because their lives don’t matter.There is very little media spotlight on the slaughter of thousands of black people at the hands of other black people every year in our major cities. And none of the people who are screaming “Black Lives Matter” say one word about any of those deaths because Black Lives Matter is purely a political movement designed to give Democrats and the far left more and more power. That’s it. We see the politicization of peoples’ lives in how Joe Biden handles our Southern border. Opening the border was done strictly for political purposes. Does anyone actually believe that Joe Biden and the Democrats care about the lives of illegal immigrants? They just want illegal immigrants to come here because they are potentially millions more votes for the Democrat party, which means more political power for them. The billionaires in our country are pro-illegal immigrants because that means millions of low-wage workers, bigger profit margins, and millions of more dollars, all of which means more power to them. But how many illegal immigrants have died trying to get into our country under Biden’s watch? How many young girls have been raped by the coyotes or sold as sex slaves by the cartels along the way? And Joe Biden and the Democrats do not say a word about any of those atrocities because it is all politics; it is all the politicization of peoples’ lives, and when you do that, you get more and more people dead.That is exactly what happened with the 'Black Lives Matter' movement. The natural offshoot of the ‘Black Lives Matter' movement was the ‘Defund the Police’ movement. Defunding the police has caused a 40% increase in violent crime and murder in our major cities' communities of color. So, the politicization of black lives costs thousands of black people their lives yearly. If we embraced the belief that “All Lives Matter,” then we would be motivated to protect all lives and stop all senseless killing.Sadly, in our political climate, the only lives that matter are the ones whose death can be exploited by the left to gain more political power for themselves. That’s it. Nobody cared about the life of George Floyd until his death could be used by the Democrats to gain power. Nobody cared about the lives of the people in Uvalde, Texas, until their deaths could be exploited by politicians like Beto O’Rourke to take guns away from American citizens. “White Lives Matter” is a divisive expression like “Black Lives Matter.” Do we want to be exclusive or inclusive? In reality, all lives matter. The expression “All Lives Matter” is inclusive; it is unifying. It connects us based on our common humanity, and what is more human than the desire to live and protect our lives? That is the number one human instinct we all have. That should unite us. And that’s why those who want to divide us based on race, ethnicity, or sex had to shut down people saying, “All Lives Matter.” They need divided humanity. And that’s where we are in this country. Nobody’s life matters until their life or their death can be exploited by the powerful to gain even more power. When it should be the exact opposite. So, nobody’s life actually matters in our current political environment. For many politicians, the only thing that matters is power.",
