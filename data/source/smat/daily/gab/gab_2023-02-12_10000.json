Not. A. Single. One.And the vast majority of Baltimore's other grade, middle, and high schools didn't fare much better, as most of their students received abysmal test scores as well.0 for 2000? How is that possible? And we're not talking about \"genius\" or \"exceptional\" students, or even those above average — just those competent at their grade level!Of which there were none at those 23 institutions of lower edumacation. And zero/none is less than \"any.\"",

Not. A. Single. One.<br /><br />And the vast majority of Baltimore's other grade, middle, and high schools didn't fare much better, as most of their students received abysmal test scores as well.<br /><br />0 for 2000? How is that possible? And we're not talking about \"genius\" or \"exceptional\" students, or even those above average — just those competent at their grade level!<br /><br />Of which there were none at those 23 institutions of lower edumacation. And zero/none is less than \"any.\"",

          "content": "A very poor translation, needless to say...Go to John 15:2. Many translations would word that first sentence to the effect of, “Every branch of mine that does not produce fruit, He cuts off.”Wording it that way implies some sort of works-based righteousness, unfortunately. That could make a reader say, “See? That person got saved but didn’t produce fruit. Break out the knife and get a fire going because stuff like that just WON’T do. That person OBVIOUSLY didn’t perform enough.”Both translating that verse as well as interpreting that verse that way...Wow...That’s, like, a DANGEROUSLY bad one. There are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. I can only imagine...Actually, I don’t even WANT TO imagine...how many had his or her faith get shipwrecked over reading something like THAT. That actually goes against the Gospel message as a whole, not to mention “to cut off” or “to take away” makes passages such as Isaiah 64:6, John 5:24, Romans 5:10, Romans 8:28-30, Ephesians 2:8-10, Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 2:13-14, Hebrews 6:4-10, Hebrews 10:14, Titus 3:4-8, Peter 1:9, 1 John 1:8-10, 1 John 2:12, etc., etc., etc. all nothing more than liars.At least a few translations out there are a LITTLE more accurate. Instead of “cuts off” they instead imply “takes away”. It goes deeper than that, however.https://biblehub.com/strongs/john/15-2.htmInstead, how it REALLY should read is how the phrase is defined in the concordance as “LIFTED UP”. A stellar example would be a Messianic Jew: That person’s attached to the vine so the Vinedresser lifts that branch up in order for some sunlight to hit it versus it being buried in the shadows all the time...Bolster it and help it along so as to make it more fruitful, in other words.In essence, what John 15:2 is REALLY SAYING is to this effect: “Jesus did 100% of everything as far as your salvation goes. By contrast, you can do nothing solo (John 15:5) and there’s no way you can somehow “earn” salvation so don’t even bother trying. If you do, you’re just deceiving yourself. None of that “Mosaic Law/Ten Commandments/synagogue” stuff or any of that “God’s chosen people” stuff or any of that ‘Judaism’ stuff is going to amount to a hill of beans eventually. Neither will any of that cult/other false religion junk. Salvation comes ONE WAY ONLY (see Acts 4:12). You ready? Hope so. Forever’s a long time.(Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). God The Father is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not God The Father.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. A person ultimately only affects him or herself and forever’s a long time. We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law.",
          "contentraw": "A very poor translation, needless to say...<br /><br />Go to John 15:2. Many translations would word that first sentence to the effect of, “Every branch of mine that does not produce fruit, He cuts off.”<br />Wording it that way implies some sort of works-based righteousness, unfortunately. That could make a reader say, “See? That person got saved but didn’t produce fruit. Break out the knife and get a fire going because stuff like that just WON’T do. That person OBVIOUSLY didn’t perform enough.”<br /><br />Both translating that verse as well as interpreting that verse that way...Wow...That’s, like, a DANGEROUSLY bad one. There are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. I can only imagine...Actually, I don’t even WANT TO imagine...how many had his or her faith get shipwrecked over reading something like THAT. That actually goes against the Gospel message as a whole, not to mention “to cut off” or “to take away” makes passages such as Isaiah 64:6, John 5:24, Romans 5:10, Romans 8:28-30, Ephesians 2:8-10, Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 2:13-14, Hebrews 6:4-10, Hebrews 10:14, Titus 3:4-8, Peter 1:9, 1 John 1:8-10, 1 John 2:12, etc., etc., etc. all nothing more than liars.<br /><br />At least a few translations out there are a LITTLE more accurate. Instead of “cuts off” they instead imply “takes away”. It goes deeper than that, however.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://biblehub.com/strongs/john/15-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>biblehub.com/strongs/john/15-2.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Instead, how it REALLY should read is how the phrase is defined in the concordance as “LIFTED UP”.
