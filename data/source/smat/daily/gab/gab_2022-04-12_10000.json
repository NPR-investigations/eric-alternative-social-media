Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal.

Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here. We can never have too many backup groups. The Only requirement is that it must be based on National Socialism and Historical Revisionism.                                                                                                                                                                                                  https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/feed?referrer=Foghornreturns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brother Groups List                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           These are groups that are similar to this NS group but they are not the same.

So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. <a href=\"http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.t<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">witter2<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal. That much is obvious!                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We have a group in Gab Chat but you need to use a Chrome-type browser to access it.                                                                                                                                                                                            <a href=\"https://chat.gab.com/chat/5f14e18b9bc96138abc117f0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>chat.gab.com/chat/5f14e18b9bc96138abc117f0<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Minds group is our backup group. Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here. We can never have too many backup groups. The Only requirement is that it must be based on National Socialism and Historical Revisionism.                                                                                                                                                                                                  <a href=\"https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/feed?referrer=Foghornreturns\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">feed?referrer=Foghornreturns<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brother Groups List                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           These are groups that are similar to this NS group but they are not the same.

Globe Earthers since Aristotle have claimed the reason that ship hulls disappear before their mast-heads when sailing away is due to the physical curvature of the Earth obfuscating their view.  This simple supposed proof is still cited today by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Michelle Thaller and other NASA spokespeople, but is easily shown invalid with the use of modern zoom technology.  By fixing a good telescope or super-zoom camera aimed at the horizon on a clear day it is possible to bring ships that have completely disappeared beyond the supposed curvature of the Earth fully back into view.NOTE:  For people who have seen my other similar videos on these subjects, I am updating them with new information, new visuals, and higher quality audio/video, also giving them different titles to to work around the algorithm.

A city can‚Äôt negate a signed contract just because the Mayor has Trump Derangement Syndrome. The judge had already granted a restraining order, allowing the Trump group to continue running the golf course until the city made its case, and it turned out it didn‚Äôt have one. More details are at this link:https://www.westernjournal.com/trump-scores-win-nyc-judge-declares-citys-case-lacks-legal-foundation/Eric Trump said of the attempted contract cancellation, ‚ÄúDe Blasio did this for his own political theater. He wasted tremendous amounts of time and city resources on his own vendetta. He is a disgrace to New York and everyone is glad he is gone.‚Äù No matter what you think of Eric Trump, when he‚Äôs right, he‚Äôs right.The real winners, of course, are the golfers of New York. Considering how the city‚Äôs liberal government kept the Wollman skating rink closed and rotting for years before Trump took it over and renovated it, I can only imagine what horrors would have befallen the course if DeBlasio took over the management.
