            "description": "This group embraces the traditionalism of those pioneers of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s known as the New Conservatives. The New Conservatives were a loose group of conservative academics and scholars who after the crisis of World War II revived interest in Western civilization and American cultural renewal. The New Conservatives also brought about a renaissance in the study of the life and work of Anglo-Irish statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke. Their immediate forebears included the New Humanists, the Distributists, T. S. Eliot, Ralph Adams Cram, C. S. Lewis, Herbert Agar, Bernard Iddings Bell, Christopher Dawson, and the Southern Agrarians.\nArticles:\n\"Understanding Traditionalist Conservatism\" by Mark C.
