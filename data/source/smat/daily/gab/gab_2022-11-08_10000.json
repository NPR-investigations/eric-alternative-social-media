            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180¬∞ opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Their source allegedly provided them with proof that the scandal-plagued election software company Konnech had compromised and stored American data in China.The newly liberated duo indicated that they will \"continue to protect and defend those who do the vital work of election integrity, and ... will make sure that their findings become a matter of public record.\"Sued!Konnech is an election software company based in Michigan. It licenses election software still utilized by various municipalities and counties across America.Catherine Engelbrecht, the founder of True the Vote, and Gregg Phillips, a board member, claimed that Konnech was \"owned by the Chinese Communist Party\" and involved in the \"subversion of our elections.\"Eugene Yu, the founder and CEO of Konnech, was arrested on Oct. 4 and charged on suspicion of data theft, having allegedly stored \"critical information that [US election] workers provided on servers in China.\"Yu was also charged with grand theft by embezzlement of funds exceeding $2.6 million.According to prosecutor Eric Neff, the crimes allegedly committed by Konnech amount to the \"largest data breach in United States history.\"In response to Engelbrecht and Phillips' claims that Konnech had done what it has now been charged with doing, the Michigan-based company filed a defamation lawsuit against True the Vote on Sept. 12, suggesting that the duo's accusations of wrongdoing were damaging.In the subsequent proceedings, Konnech demanded that the True the Vote leaders provide the names of anyone who may have been involved in their efforts to expose the company for its alleged malfeasance.Konnech successfully obtained a restraining order to that effect, which Judge Hoyt found the duo in contempt of on Oct. 27.After being found in contempt, Phillips wrote on Truth Social, \"Doing the right thing isn't always easy but it's always right. We were held in contempt of court because we refused to burn a confidential informant or our researchers. We go to jail on Monday unless we comply.\"In an Oct. 28 post, Phillips complimented Engelbrecht, writing that despite being ridiculed by Konnech's lawyers, \"She answered with confidence and pride in her Country. She didn't buckle. She stood against the abuse and the oppressors.

It is stronger than ever.\"\"The right to free and fair elections without interference is more important than our own discomforts and even this detention, now reversed by a higher court,\" wrote Engelbrecht.Engelbrecht wrote on Truth Social Monday afternoon, \"We're out.
