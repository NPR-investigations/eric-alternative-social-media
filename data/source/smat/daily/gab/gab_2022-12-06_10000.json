They have a good relationship. It’s just the rumor mill.”Former President Donald Trump, we hear, came to the fundraiser for half-an-hour, but left before a “holiday boat parade.” Eric Trump and his wife, Lara, were also in attendance.Eric had only kind words for Guilfoyle, telling us, “I am best friends with Don and had an absolute blast at the party.”Rumors that Guilfoyle might be on the outs with some of the Trump family started last month.During Tiffany Trump’s wedding last month to billionaire Michael Boulos, Ivanka made headlines by cropping Guilfoyle out of a family photo shared on social media.---------------------------------------------------------------------------This woman is 53 years old, and she is a low-down rough rider and a dirty dog. Old, used-up women who are on the dating market are always going to be bloodsuckers. However, even if they weren’t, it makes zero sense why someone in a position of power and influence would choose such a person to have a romance with. Why would you not get a young girl?I can’t ever think about this couple without thinking about when the groypers protested a Turning Point USA event they were at, and Guilfoyle went full “angry mommy” mode and started telling our lads that their mothers are mad at them and they must not be able to have sex or they wouldn’t believe in things.It was like a parody.The two ended up disappearing out the back like Batman.He later went on with the Jew Mark Levin and claimed that the Groypers are leftists.The whole situation sort of demonstrated that being the son of a capable man doesn’t make you capable, and there may actually be a negative correlation.Donald Trump would not bitch out when booed, and he definitely would not be riding dirty with a sneaky dog 53 years of age.I won’t ever blame a man for a divorce, because men simply do not have rights in divorce courts and I genuinely do not believe that any man wants a divorce.But I will say: Don Jr. has had a very serious fall from grace.If your wife leaves you and you start dating a hot teenage girl, the wife is going to get very jealous and make overtures towards fixing things. If you start dating a rough-riding 53-year-old town bicycle, she’s going to say “ew, gross – I really was too good for him.”At the very least, we must say, a divorce man going full “used-up hag” is not a strategy for getting the kids back.https://dailystormer.in/trump-family-allegedly-dislikes-don-jr-s-elderly-prune-like-girl-fiend/",

The below image with the triangle showing all Three being connected as one God is better, but I prefer the image which shows only the Three, with the Son and Holy Spirit being begotten/proceeding from the Father. An easy clarification is then that the Son and Spirit are eternally coexistent with the Father, and have the fullness of the Father and are thus everything He is except for being the Father. I know Rome and the East have some disagreements here, but neither declare the other heretics over it... so for an image that right away doesn't create heretical implications for the viewer, I really prefer NOT using the Trinity Shield.",

At this stage, however, it is reasonable for us to assume that they may have been and that caution is warranted,” Baker wrote in an email at the time, the text of which was posted by Taibbi. “There are some facts that indicate that the materials may have been hacked, while there are others indicating that the computer was either abandoned and/or the owner consented to allow the repair shop to access it for at least some purposes.”But several years prior, while serving as general counsel for the FBI, Baker was the one who personally reviewed the FBI’s FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrant against Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Although Baker’s superiors were initially reluctant to approve such a warrant due to the lack of evidence, the warrant was ultimately approved several months later after former British spy Christopher Steele submitted his now-debunked dossier claiming collusion between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Baker has since defended the Steele dossier, even despite being completely discredited, claiming that “When a source shows up with a big stack of information, as in this case, you go to work. It came in from what appears to be a reliable source. He gives you all this information. Go to work. Try to validate it.”Baker eventually fell under investigation himself by the Department of Justice after allegations arose that he had been sharing classified information with reporters. He resigned a disgrace in 2018, before being hired by Twitter in 2020.",

Last week's hasty indictment marks a dramatic shift in Justice Department subpoena enforcement.  After allowing the Obama-Biden administration to run roughshod over congressional subpoena authority for years, everything has changed now that the Trump administration is in the crosshairs.  Make no mistake – congressional subpoenas should not be optional.  But in today’s DOJ there are two standards. In the Fast and Furious case, former Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress. DOJ did nothing.  With the former State Department IT specialist, the DOJ refused to enforce our congressional referral for prosecution.I issued a subpoena for Pagliano's testimony in 2016.  He did not show up at the hearing.  I issued a second subpoena and had the U.S. Marshals serve him the paperwork so there was no ambiguity. Again, he refused to appear. Our committee voted on a straight party-line vote to hold him in contempt of Congress.Pagliano's failure to comply should have been an easy prosecution for DOJ. There was no executive privilege claim. He already had an immunity agreement in place, so he was facing no legal jeopardy. (Incidentally, Pagliano's sweetheart immunity deal with the DOJ inexplicably contained no provisions requiring him to cooperate with any investigation – which is generally the whole point of an immunity agreement.)Even more bizarre was the way Pagliano and the State Department got away with thumbing his nose at the document requests. After working for years at the State Department in IT for the secretary of State specifically, we were expected to believe he had never sent or received a single email. The State Department claimed they could find nothing.Congress used to enforce its own subpoenas but turned over that role to the executive branch decades ago. Bad move.A subpoena is only effective if it can be enforced. I implored both Attorneys General Loretta Lynch and Jeff Sessions to prosecute Pagliano to ensure congressional subpoenas would have teeth. I pled with my Democratic colleagues on the House Oversight Committee to stand with me, understanding that one day they would be the ones seeking to enforce subpoenas.  None did.  Now they have suddenly found urgency and backbone for congressional oversight.Perhaps the only thing worse than a DOJ that refuses to enforce congressional subpoena authority is a DOJ that only enforces it when one party is in power.

No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.<br /><br />Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.",
