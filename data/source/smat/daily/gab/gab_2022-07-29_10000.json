Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else&#39;s well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:<br /><\/li><li>Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts<br /><\/li><li>Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)<br /><\/li><li>Posts that don&#39;t meet the criteria mentioned above<br /><\/li><li>Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.<br /><\/li><li>Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)<br /><\/li><li>All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.<br />***<br />Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.<br />***<br />“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV<br /><\/li><\/ol>",

There is no doubt that we are in the midst of a new cultural wave of witness and wounding.The sins of the sexes are being openly exposed and good work is coming about because of some of these movements. But there is a deep divide opening up as well and the separation between men and women is alarming to those working with men. What do you do when people’s voices need to be heard, but men are not always the most open conversationalists about matters of their inner and relational lives?I think most people working with men know that men need sacred circles of other guys to contemplate, communicate and confess their life journey. Too many places are fraught with danger, shame and shallow analysis or answers. Men need to create faithful fraternities that can be the anvils upon which they forge new lives. Amidst the spark, flame and smoke of community, men can be remade, sharpened and hardened in the steel of their inner lives.This takes time and a commitment by men and those working with them, to invest over the long haul. Too many men’s groups are all flower and not enough root. They are built on events and often fail to connect men beyond attendance life.

Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nation-alists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to “kidnap” Michigan Gov. Whitmer.
