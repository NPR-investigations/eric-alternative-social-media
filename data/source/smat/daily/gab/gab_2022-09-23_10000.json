Instead, she announced a civil lawsuit seeking $250 million and his permanent banishment from doing business in the state. Like many things involving the law and Trump, the reasons James, a Democrat, opted for a lawsuit rather than a prosecution are complicated. For one, even if she did want to prosecute Trump, she doesn’t have jurisdiction under state law to bring a criminal case against him or any of the lawsuit's other defendants, including the Trump Organization and his three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump. In New York, the state attorney general’s office is only allowed to prosecute a limited range of offenses on its own, like bid rigging and payroll violations. Otherwise, the office must partner with a county district attorney on a prosecution — as James' office did with the Manhattan district attorney's office in a case against Trump's longtime finance chief — or obtain what’s known as a criminal referral from the governor or a state agency that has jurisdiction over the alleged wrongdoing.",

In Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Wyoming, the attorney general is a gubernatorial appointee. The attorney general in Tennessee is appointed by the Tennessee Supreme Court for an eight-year term. In Maine, the attorney general is elected by the state Legislature for a two-year term.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general\n\nThe District of Columbia and two U.S. territories, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, elect their attorneys general for a four-year term. 2014 marked the first year that the District of Columbia and Northern Mariana Islands held an election for the office. In American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the attorney general is appointed by the governor. In Puerto Rico, the attorney general is officially called the secretary of justice, but is commonly known as the Puerto Rico attorney general.\n",

There is no representation. No American would continue to enslave generations of grandchildren to Trillion dollar bills. You can throw a dart at a phone book, and get better American representation right now.   America has been Taken over by the Enemy. With Head Traitor Mike Pence certifying the installation of the non-uniformed, Enemy Combatants, posers and shills, Biden and Harris.   Not one traitorous, quisling snake, so-called representative has called out obvious Usurpation of the presidency and America or the obvious Treason and Sedition everyday now either.  Not one traitorous, quisling snake, so-called representative has called out obvious Crimes against Humanity targeting Our Children FFS too.  No arrests for Soros, the foreign actor homosexual phoney poser AKA Obama, Hillary, Leon Pannetta, Susan Rice, Eric Holder, Valerie Jarrett and so many others too.  Traitors one and all. Trump supports Sedition with endorsement of the Evil muslim Dr Oz, and Trump supports Children sex mutilation surgery too. Trump appointed Three Traitors to the supreme Court. Trump is allowing his So-called second term to burn away, while America is at War and under Enemy Occupation. Trump is still touting the inhumane so-called vaccine, that is truly obvious Crimes against Humanity targeting Our Children also.   There is no representation, no Dem / republican paradigm any more, it doesn't exist.  With Head Traitor Mike Pence certifying the installation of the non-uniformed, Enemy Combatants, posers and shills, Biden and Harris.

The entire rat bastard so-called congress and supreme Court is compromised, and needs to be arrested for installing the foreign actor homosexual phoney poser AKA Obama, Twice before, and now the wingman for the first Two usurpations of the presidency and America, Biden is installed.  There is no representation. No American would continue to enslave generations of grandchildren to Trillion dollar bills. You can throw a dart at a phone book, and get better American representation right now.   America has been Taken over by the Enemy. With Head Traitor Mike Pence certifying the installation of the non-uniformed, Enemy Combatants, posers and shills, Biden and Harris.   Not one traitorous, quisling snake, so-called representative has called out obvious Usurpation of the presidency and America or the obvious Treason and Sedition everyday now either.  Not one traitorous, quisling snake, so-called representative has called out obvious Crimes against Humanity targeting Our Children FFS too.  No arrests for Soros, the foreign actor homosexual phoney poser AKA Obama, Hillary, Leon Pannetta, Susan Rice, Eric Holder, Valerie Jarrett and so many others too.  Traitors one and all. Trump supports Sedition with endorsement of the Evil muslim Dr Oz, and Trump supports Children sex mutilation surgery too. Trump appointed Three Traitors to the supreme Court. Trump is allowing his So-called second term to burn away, while America is at War and under Enemy Occupation. Trump is still touting the inhumane so-called vaccine, that is truly obvious Crimes against Humanity targeting Our Children also.   There is no representation, no Dem / republican paradigm any more, it doesn't exist.  With Head Traitor Mike Pence certifying the installation of the non-uniformed, Enemy Combatants, posers and shills, Biden and Harris. Spitting on all Americans, and calling all Americans Stupid, as anyone with two brain cells connected, and common sense, knows that Biden couldn't ever get winning numbers.  It's Treason and Sedition writ Large everyday now too.   The entire structure is illegitimate, non-uniformed Enemy Combatant controlled territory now.   Act accordingly...",

Sadly though, yesterday, an asylum seeker in one of our facilities took her own life. Our hearts break for this young woman and any loved ones she may have, and we, as a city, mourn her,” Adams said.

Jessica Ramos of Queens said in a statement. “Her act was a direct response to the lack of care provided by the City.“There is no excuse for a failure of this magnitude.”In the same statement, Ramos criticized Adams for suggesting (without offering specific policy prescriptions) that it’s time for New York to reassess its “right to shelter” laws.",

These were mostly Black and White.\nWhen the families moved to better school districts it left the liberal cities a void.\nThat void was filled with illegal aliens.\nThis created inequalities and segregation. \nIt also led to drive-by-shootings and violence in the schools. \nGang wars pitted the immigrants against one another and blacks.\nTeachers wouldn't teach in violent cities and left those kids to be educated by subpar teachers.\n\nClimate alarmism was created by the United Nations and introduced to congress by Nancy Pelosi in 1992 as Agenda 21.\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/353\nThe United Nations wants to be unelected global leaders with open borders.\nPelosi made her open borders stance clear when in 2016 she flew to Mexico City and got former\nMexico President Vicente Fox to declare Trump voters as \"lazy drunks\".\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/pelosi-vicente-fox-plot-to-defeat-trump-mexican-calls-trump-voters-lazy-drunks\n\nCalifornia's Governor Newsom within a week after defending his recall, made a law by decree that every neighborhood would have to provide affordable housing.

(Ballotpedia)The Biden Recession is here. Unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7%. The labor force participation rate rose to 62.4% in August.  Still, 50% of employers anticipate job cuts in the next six months.Feds have raised the interest rates 5 times this year. For the first time since 2008, mortgage interest rates are over 6%. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell vows to keep at it until the job (of beating inflation) is done. At the rate Congress spends our money, I don't see how they can keep up. The feds raised interest rates another .75 percentage points on Wednesday.Gas is $3.68/gallon. Uh-oh.⬆️ (AAA) Inflation is 8.3%.😡 DOW tumbled 1,276 points for its worst day since June, 2020.

(Reuters says 39%, -15 spread.)Build The WallDC mayor Bowser is upset that her city shelters are being \"overrun\" with illegal aliens. In response, she has issued a limited public health emergency. Hmm. THAT can't be good.  At least 3  buses of illegals were unloaded in front of Kamala's Naval Observatory residence. Don't let up now, Gov. Abbott ❗Eric Adams has opened 14 luxury hotels in NYC free to the illegals. Nearly 5 MILLION illegals have skipped across Joe's border already.  TX Gov Abbott has now added Chicago to the destination list for illegals.  Mayor Lightfoot is immediately busing them out to the suburbs.Ron DeSantis sent 2 planes of illegals to Martha's Vineyard and the dems went berserk. 125 National Guard were immediately deployed to escort the 50 illegals out of the snobby neighborhood that says they welcome ALL. Using this model, we would need 12,500,000 Ice Agents at the border to eliminate the invasion.  Next stop: Joe's place in Wilmington, DE❓  DeSantis makes light of any lawsuits or investigations targeting him.

No, the NIH still does NOT advise using ivermectin to treat Covid-19 except in clinical trials. The NIH is years behind the data and efficacy, and thousands have died because of it.  ➡️ The UK starts paying out big bucks for injuries and deaths caused by the experimental Covid jab.⬅️Current events.Joe hands out 300 billion dollars, or is that a trillion, to pay off college studentloans.  Unconstitutional ❗  Congress controls the purse strings. Biden gave his dark, divisive, speech on the \"soul of the nation\" at Independence Hall, Philadelphia, almost calling MAGA terrorists.
