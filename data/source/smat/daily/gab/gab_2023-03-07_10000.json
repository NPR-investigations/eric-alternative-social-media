If you do, know this: you'll never fairly win an election ever again. \n\nIf you want to start fighting back, I will show you how and I will provide you with the ERIC files. I just dropped this on our county prosecutor's desk along with 236 files of research and a completed diagram of the entire ERIC system.\n\nSo what's it going to be?\n\n_________________________________\n\nMarch 7, 2023\n\nElection officials, and elected officials of the State of Michigan have processed and catalogued voters in the State of Michigan in a “not for profit” private voter registration system known as ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center). This privately controlled voter registration system (“ERIC”) records personal data across the entire nation. This data is known to be visible to individuals who are arbitrarily placed on “The Board” for ERIC, and not voted for, approved, nor even announced to the voting public in the state of Michigan. \n\nThe citizens of the State of Michigan did not request this registration in the ERIC system. The citizens did not approve of this registration in the ERIC system. The vast, greater majority of the citizens of the State of Michigan have no idea at all that they have been involuntarily registered in the ERIC system. \n\nThis presents legal challenges on multiple levels, from simple invasion of privacy to potential voter fraud to flagrant manipulation and exposure of election data to unknown entities and persons. \n\nIt is recommended that the various counties of the State of Michigan examine these facts, and demand the removal of the State of Michigan from the unlawful, privatized registration system known as ERIC. \n\nStates already removing their citizens from ERIC:\n-\tLouisiana\n-\tAlabama\n-\tFlorida\n-\tMissouri\n-\tWest Virginia\n\nSee: accompanying electronic files with complete “map” of the entire ERIC network and structure, and associated persons.\n\nv/r'",

We will remove a post according to our interpretation (written by us) of the guidelines below. If there is any confusion, please DM.***My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n\r\n***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING: Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n\r\n***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else's well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? \r\n\r\nWith that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.\r\n\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n\r\n***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n\r\n***“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.” Numbers 6:24-27 ESV\r\n\r\n***Group Creator:  @Micaiah\r\nAdmins/Mods: @Shooglenifty, @riustan",

In addition, anyone “who lost accrued leave, compensation or employment” will have to be made “whole,” with interest paid “at the maximum legal rate,” according to the Feb. 24 decision obtained by The Post.The decision affects at least about 25 court officers who were fired, said Dennis Quirk, president of the New York State Court Officers Association, one of 10 unions that challenged the mandate.It’s unclear whether the decision will affect other state and Big Apple government employees who refused to get vaccinated, some of whom are suing New York City.

Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate but chose not to warn him that an army of federal goons was about to descend on Palm Beach like a swarm of locusts, according to a new White Hat study General Eric M. Smith shared with his council on Tuesday.The report, authored by U.S. Army Cyber Command and Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command, asserts that DeSantis entertained AG Merrick Garland at the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee on July 25, two weeks ahead of the raid. It states that the joint cyber command task force acquired surveillance footage of Garland and two unidentified men arriving at DeSantis’ home at 8:00 p.m. that evening.That alone, our source said, sounded alarm bells; Gen. Smith saw no reason why DeSoros, who has sharply criticized the regime, would for any reason sit down with Garland, who has weaponized the Department of Justice to target law-abiding patriots. Moreover, the meeting appeared clandestine because neither the Justice Dept. nor DeSoros’ camp publicly mentioned the gathering.“There’s nothing technically criminal about the meeting. DeSoros can invite anyone he wants into his home, but it was highly suspicious, in retrospect, knowing now that they met in secret shortly before the unlawful occupation of President Trump’s home.Although Trump had yet to triumphantly announce he would seek an ‘official’ return to the White House in 2024, DeSoros might have been fishing for dirt to further impugn Trump’s unimpeachable character, our source added.“We don’t know if DeSoros wanted the presidency before midterms. But if expected to win, as he did, he could’ve made advance moves, maybe hoping the raid would be damaging enough to make President Trump get out of his way. Trump didn’t announce until much later, but DeSoros undoubtedly saw Trump as an unbeatable opponent,” our source said.Other information on the report cemented Gen. Smith’s hypothesis that DeSoros was conspiring with Merrick Garland to topple Trump. Cyberspace Command reportedly has text messages in which Garland writes, “We’re coming,” and DeSoros responds, “Thanks for the heads up,”—timestamped three hours before the FBI swarm illegally and unprecedently violated the home of a President of the United States.Several members of the White Hat Council believe DeSoros is a Trojan Horse, a globalist masquerading as a freedom-loving Republican whose anti-woke rhetoric is merely a ruse to beguile voters, and whose true ambition, if he sits in the Oval Office, is to deepen The Swamp an enrich a corrupt federal government. However, a holdout on the council still sees DeSantis as the better option and has called the texts “innocuous and inconclusive.”Like his predecessor Gen. David H. Berger, General Smith says DeSoros committed unforgivable atrocities by allowing FEMA to terrorize Floridians during last year’s Hurricane Ian.Asked if White Hats are building a case against DeSoros, he said, “Even if I knew, I couldn’t say. But there’s overwhelming animus toward him. The majority of the armed forces stand with President Trump.”",
          "contentraw": "DeSOROS! -- ur done dude = DeSOROS Had Advance Knowledge of Mar-a-Lago Raid; Texted With AG Garland<br />Florida Governor Ron DeSOROS had advance knowledge of the FBI’s August 8 raid on President Donald J. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate but chose not to warn him that an army of federal goons was about to descend on Palm Beach like a swarm of locusts, according to a new White Hat study General Eric M. Smith shared with his council on Tuesday.<br /><br />The report, authored by U.S. Army Cyber Command and Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command, asserts that DeSantis entertained AG Merrick Garland at the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee on July 25, two weeks ahead of the raid. It states that the joint cyber command task force acquired surveillance footage of Garland and two unidentified men arriving at DeSantis’ home at 8:00 p.m. that evening.<br /><br />That alone, our source said, sounded alarm bells; Gen. Smith saw no reason why DeSoros, who has sharply criticized the regime, would for any reason sit down with Garland, who has weaponized the Department of Justice to target law-abiding patriots.
