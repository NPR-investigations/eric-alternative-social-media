All suspicions on the very start, beginning with the seemingly fraudulent DNC ‘hack”, focused on one Dmitri Alperovich.Almost six years ago, I began a video series with the first title - “Where is Eric Braverman”, referring to the missing CEO of the Clinton Foundation,  who had gone missing right before the 2016 Presidential Election.I also connected Kolomoisky through the DNC with Clinton Foundation President Eric Braverman. Along the way in my reporting about the CEO of the Clinton Foundation, I was given very credible information Braverman was safe in Israel, having been given safe passage to Tel Aviv, and then been secreted away to a nearby kibbutz run by Facebook/Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s brother. It turned out the Braverman had indeed met with Igor Kolomoisky of Ukrainian Azon Battalion fame in Tel Aviv before being secreted out of the public view.Journalist George Webb extensively detailed the evidence against the Clinton Foundation’s laundering of dark weapons profits obtained from the overthrow of the Libyan Government in 2011.One thing is for sure now though -Michael Stenger is dead.

And even sleep apnea.You can use salt. Not necessarily taking salt but breathing in salt. There’s a machine called a halo generator, which provides something called halotherapy where you breathe salt air. The machine ionizes the salt and puts it out into the air. You can use it while you sleep. Halotherapy can loosen up the mucus in your lungs, sinuses, and throat. Salt has the capacity to thin out the mucus. It’s antifungal, antibacterial, and it’s also anti-mold. I’ve put links below to some machines that I think are good. (I’m not affiliated with the companies that make them.)Another option is to use something called a neti pot to wash out your sinuses with salt water.Check your house for mold or mildew, which could be why your lungs are constantly filled with mucus. If you change locations, you might be surprised at how your sinus or lung condition goes away. From a nutritional standpoint, oregano oil is really good to treat mucus. So too is garlic and a longer fast, say once a month for 48 to 72 hours, you can put your body into serious autophagy, which will clean up old damaged proteins as well as your immune system. It’ll also deactivate microbes and viruses. If you have a virus that’s causing the mucus, I recommend taking olive leaf extract. And now you know how to treat respiratory mucus with salt!https://youtu.be/eC1T6gtzbjA",

The covert operations in Ukraine are a part of a significant effort by Western governments to weaken Russia.Citing unnamed current and former officials, the NYT explains the CIA has officers secretly deployed to Kiev to give intelligence about the war to Ukrainian officials. “CIA personnel have continued to operate in the country secretly, mostly in the capital, Kiev, directing much of the massive amounts of intelligence the United States is sharing with Ukrainian forces,” Eric Schmitt writes in the NYT.Some Ukrainian military officers say the American intelligence is having an impact on the battlefield. The NYT describes the process as the CIA making satellite photos available to the Ukrainian forces near the front lines with tablets. Kiev’s soldiers can use the tablets to access a battlefield mapping app to assist in targeting Russian troops.The report from the NYT is the first admission that Americans are on the ground in Ukraine. President Joe Biden has pledged not to deploy American forces to Ukraine and withdrew 150 soldiers training Ukrainian forces before Russia invaded on February 24.However, several of America’s NATO allies have filled that void. According to the NYT, special operations forces from Britain, France, Canada and Lithuania are training Ukrainian forces near the frontlines. The role of the commandos is to train and advise Ukrainian troops and provide a conduit for weapons. Schmitt admits his article does not describe the complete activities of the CIA and European commandos in Ukraine.The presence of CIA officers and commandos in Ukraine appears to contradict previous stories in CNN and the NYT. On June 8, Julia Barnes wrote in the New York Times that the US intelligence community had “blind spots” in Ukraine. On April 19, a CNN article noted the White House can only monitor weapons entering Ukraine for a short time before they enter into a “black hole,” and the US has almost “zero ability” to track the weapons. Both reports emphasize the US intelligence community’s lack of operations within Ukraine to explain their inability to collect more complete information on the war.https://www.veteranstoday.com/2022/06/27/cia-european-commandos-operating-on-the-ground-in-ukraine/",
          "contentraw": "CIA, European Commandos Operating on the Ground in Ukraine<br /><br />CIA officers are in Kiev to pass intelligence to Ukrainian officials, and special operations forces from several allied countries are training Ukrainian troops near the battlefield.<br /><br />By Kyle Anzalone<br /><br />The New York Times reports CIA officers are in Kiev to pass intelligence to Ukrainian officials, and special operations forces from several allied countries are training Ukrainian troops near the battlefield. The covert operations in Ukraine are a part of a significant effort by Western governments to weaken Russia.<br /><br />Citing unnamed current and former officials, the NYT explains the CIA has officers secretly deployed to Kiev to give intelligence about the war to Ukrainian officials. “CIA personnel have continued to operate in the country secretly, mostly in the capital, Kiev, directing much of the massive amounts of intelligence the United States is sharing with Ukrainian forces,” Eric Schmitt writes in the NYT.<br /><br />Some Ukrainian military officers say the American intelligence is having an impact on the battlefield. The NYT describes the process as the CIA making satellite photos available to the Ukrainian forces near the front lines with tablets. Kiev’s soldiers can use the tablets to access a battlefield mapping app to assist in targeting Russian troops.<br /><br />The report from the NYT is the first admission that Americans are on the ground in Ukraine. President Joe Biden has pledged not to deploy American forces to Ukraine and withdrew 150 soldiers training Ukrainian forces before Russia invaded on February 24.<br /><br />However, several of America’s NATO allies have filled that void. According to the NYT, special operations forces from Britain, France, Canada and Lithuania are training Ukrainian forces near the frontlines. The role of the commandos is to train and advise Ukrainian troops and provide a conduit for weapons. Schmitt admits his article does not describe the complete activities of the CIA and European commandos in Ukraine.<br /><br />The presence of CIA officers and commandos in Ukraine appears to contradict previous stories in CNN and the NYT. On June 8, Julia Barnes wrote in the New York Times that the US intelligence community had “blind spots” in Ukraine. On April 19, a CNN article noted the White House can only monitor weapons entering Ukraine for a short time before they enter into a “black hole,” and the US has almost “zero ability” to track the weapons. Both reports emphasize the US intelligence community’s lack of operations within Ukraine to explain their inability to collect more complete information on the war.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.veteranstoday.com/2022/06/27/cia-european-commandos-operating-on-the-ground-in-ukraine/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>veteranstoday.com/2022/06/27/cia-european-com<span class=\"invisible\">mandos-operating-on-the-ground-in-ukraine/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
