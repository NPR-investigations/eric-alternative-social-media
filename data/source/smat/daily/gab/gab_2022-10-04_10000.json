Gathering together in peaceful protest of these restrictions in person must continue, or we will end up being drowned out and shouted down by the compliant. \n\nI am not willing to continue living in a masked Michigan. I love this State and I love the people of Michigan, but now more than ever this is our moment to stand up and be counted! If we do not stand up now, these restrictions will become significantly harder to remove, if not impossible. If you care at all about helping businesses to be able to make these decisions for themselves without the fear of losing licenses, incurring massive fines for violation of these orders, or becoming embroiled in extensive legal battles costing thousands of dollars, please stand with us! \n\nStand with me on May 26th at 9am in Lansing to make your voice heard!! \n\nNOTE: PLEASE BE PEACEFUL! This is a masking protest. We are 2A friendly but do not get aggressive with the citizens of Lansing or the police. Please stay focused on the task at hand and do not give the media a reason to make this about something totally irrelevant. Thank you\n\nLocation of Protest: 530 W. Allegan Street, Lansing MI 48909\nDirections to the main building can be found here: https://www.michigan.gov/leo/0,5863,7-336-94422_11407_15349-86540--,00.html\n\nRSVP Here! https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0c45a8a62faafdc52-signup",

It's good for him, plus a woman stays infertile while nursing.﻿ One baby every three years or so is about right.\" ﻿🔵 At that juncture the front door opened and Eric stepped in. He stopped after two ﻿ steps and observed, \"Well, well, well.

In mock admonishment she ﻿ added, \"Eric, you treat Dory right.

While the provisions of Indiana’s abortion ban allow for exceptions for rape or incest, the woman in question holds that the reason for her involuntary pregnancy is the legal inability for a woman to consent to sex, along with the failure of birth control, FOX59 reported.Both Republican Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indiana Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita are named defendants in the suit.The suit further states that two of the tenets of The Satanic Temple are violated by the law, holding that “one’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone,” and that the baby as fetal tissue is an extension of the mother’s body.The Satanic Temple stated that members’ “beliefs should conform to one’s best scientific understanding of the world,” disagreeing with language in the law that says an unborn child is a child, holding instead that an unborn baby is fetal tissue and is nothing more than a part of a woman’s body.",

Wade earlier this year. In Michigan, an 84-year-old pro-life volunteer was shot while canvassing door-to-door in support of a pro-life ballot measure. Following the Roe decision, numerous other pro-life centers were vandalized or partially destroyed, from tactics ranging from graffiti to firebombing by Molotov cocktails; a far-left domestic terrorist group known as “Jane’s Revenge” claimed credit for most of the attacks.In Texas, two volunteers for the re-election campaign of Governor Greg Abbott (R-Texas) were attacked in a Houston suburb, when a man chased them through the neighborhood up to their car; as he attempted to rip one of the volunteers out of the car, he tore off the side view mirror before they managed to drive away.Many GOP campaign offices across the country have also been vandalized by far-left terrorists. The Larimer County Republican Party headquarters in Colorado and the Ottawa County GOP building in Michigan both faced vandalism that included the destruction of campaign signs and damage to the facades of the buildings. In Florida, a GOP office in Seminole County had graffiti sprayed onto the wall calling Republicans “fascists.”During Biden’s September 1st speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, which featured ominous dark-red lighting and two silhouetted Marines standing at attention behind the podium, Biden declared that “Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.” Biden also referred to supporters of President Trump as “a clear and present danger;” President Trump received the votes of over 74 million Americans in the 2020 presidential election.“They promote authoritarian leaders,” Biden falsely claimed, “and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.”Political violence by the Left has spiked in recent years, spearheaded by the race riots committed by Black Lives Matter and other far-left racial groups. Even prior to the nationwide riots in 2020 that destroyed hundreds of cities, thousands of businesses, killed over two dozen, and caused over $2 billion in damages, various other violent riots had impacted other cities around the country in preceding years, including Baltimore, Maryland and Ferguson, Missouri.",

The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

Gestisce quasi $ 10 trilioni e la stragrande maggioranza dei suoi investimenti viene effettuata \"passivamente\", il che significa che il denaro viene investito in indici di azioni e non si verifica alcuna selezione stock per titolo. BlackRock gestisce denaro per grandi istituzioni e pensioni. Quasi tutti quelli che leggono questo hanno soldi o conoscono qualcuno che ha soldi direttamente o indirettamente in un account BlackRock.Nonostante BlackRock investa passivamente per la maggior parte dei clienti, esercita un potere immenso, sia sulle società di cui detiene le azioni, sia attraverso di esse sull'economia americana. Questo perché, anche se BlackRock non è il proprietario finale delle azioni che gestisce, può votare quelle azioni per conto dei suoi clienti.Questo enorme potere di voto consente a BlackRock di esercitare un'influenza straordinaria sulla gestione e sulle politiche aziendali. Quelle società stesse sono spesso colossi come Exxon e Microsoft. Inoltre, BlackRock funziona in un ambiente intensamente oligopolistico. Solo altri tre gestori patrimoniali - Fidelity, Vanguard e State Street - iniziano a confrontarsi con esso per dimensioni e peso, ed è il più grande di tutti.BlackRock tocca la vita quotidiana di quasi tuttiBlackRock è una delle principali cause della sinistra corporativa in America, usando il suo potere per promuovere priorità politiche di sinistra . Solo nel terzo trimestre appena concluso del 2021, BlackRock si è opposto alla rielezione di 800 direttori di società . In un solo esempio, a causa della leva di BlackRock, la grande compagnia petrolifera americana Exxon sta valutando la possibilità di abbandonare diversi progetti di perforazione a causa della rimozione di membri del consiglio da parte di BlackRock e dell'installazione di nuovi membri, nonostante il mondo sia oggettivamente sottoinvestito nella produzione di energia. Se la tua benzina costa di più, pensa a BlackRock.BlackRock contribuisce anche al problema del monopolio dell'economia . Nonostante lo sfortunato consolidamento del potere all'interno di poche grandi aziende, le più grandi aziende di un singolo settore dovrebbero ancora competere tra loro testa a testa sul prezzo e sulla qualità. Pertanto, American Airlines, Delta e United dovrebbero cercare di fornire un servizio migliore o meno costoso ai passeggeri aerei.Ma BlackRock e gli altri grandi asset manager hanno \"partecipazioni incrociate\" in tutti i più grandi attori del settore, una conseguenza degli investimenti passivi. Infatti, BlackRock e gli altri gestori patrimoniali sono spesso i maggiori azionisti di ciascuna delle più grandi aziende del settore .Quando questa situazione è stata analizzata nel settore delle compagnie aeree , i ricercatori hanno riscontrato prezzi più elevati (minore concorrenza) sulle rotte tra due compagnie aeree concorrenti quando entrambe le compagnie aeree contavano lo stesso manager \"passivo\" come loro maggiore azionista (Eric Posner e Glen Weyl esaminano le prove nel loro libro “Mercati Radicali”). Quindi: se il tuo vettore aereo perde i bagagli, fornisce un servizio scadente o ti addebita troppo, pensa a BlackRock.BlackRock è anche una delle cause principali dell'aumento senza precedenti dei prezzi delle case che ha ucciso i sogni di così tanti americani di possedere le proprie case.

Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that.  The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: San-dra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this re-sult in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that.  The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: San-dra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided de-cisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that.  The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

You trick them into believing their family is more dangerous to their community than beneficial. Then you can illegally incarcerate (kidnap) them!       \"The Nixon Campaign and the Nixon White House had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we could not make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and to criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could [falsely] arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them on the evening news night after night. Did we know we were lying about drugs? Of course we did!\" Quote from John Ehrlichman, President Nixon's domestic policy adviser.       Nixon's Chief of Staff H.R. Halderman collaborated this was the scam: \"Nixon's intent was to incarcerate all of Black America. The key was to devise a system that accomplished this without appearing to.\" The War on Drugs is that system. When a long-term senator was asked about the whites snared in this scheme he stated: \"Trash, acceptable collateral damage!\"       When the scheme was implemented, to reverse the gains of the Civil Rights Movement, the maximum penalty for a federal drug violation was one year. Joe Biden and the Clintons expanded Nixon's disguised War by increasing the penalties; falsely prosecuting state charges in federal courts; forcing the states to increase their penalties; enacting three strikes, mandatory minimum and 85% sentencing laws.       These acts have kidnapped Americans from their families/communities, robbing them of security, knowledge, labor, income, businesses and love. If you calculate the damages, Americans have been unlawfully incarcerated more than 500 million years and counting. These tyrants owe and have deprived (robbed) Americans of over $1 Zillion in loss innovation, labor, pain and suffering, and it is the leading cause of America's decline in the world.       This is not by accident, they have exposed their scam in plain language. Joe Biden is the primary architect in this fraud, writing and/or sponsoring numerous bills to help perpetrate it. Including the 1994 Crime Bill and the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act.       Biden has had plenty of help. Even when congress acknowledges this fraud, they refuse to do anything about it. Former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh told congress it was illegal and unconstitutional to put U.S. citizens in federal prison for so called \"regulatory offenses\" (drug charges). see: http://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CHRG-111hhrg51226.       Federal Appeals Court Judges are in on the fraud as well. Judge Carolyn Dineen King acted as U.S. Attorney from the bench when the Assistant U.S. Attorney conceded that the U.S.. had NO jurisdiction (law authority) in a drug charged criminal case. see: U.S. v. Brown, 86 http://F.App'x 749(5thCir.2004). Louisiana Law requires judges to have a Louisiana Law License, yet Judge King has never had one!       Even Eric Holder, former U.S. Attorney General, refused to respond when presented evidence that federal criminal law (Titles 18 and 21 of the U.S. Code) do not apply within the jurisdiction of any particular state. see: 18 U.S..C. ss 7. When the writer requested his attorneys argue this law, Tim Meche, Daniel Stanford and Dustin Talbot all refused as they knowingly participate in this fraud.       If you or your family member is in federal prison, pending federal trial and/or under federal investigation, contact the GSA-General Service Administration to see if the feds had jurisdiction in that case. See attached letter from the GSA acknowledging the feds had NO jurisdiction. (Feds claim crimes committed from 3708 Third Street.). 40 U.S.C ss 3112, says the federal government must obtain the property, and provide notice to the states. Adams v. U.S., 87 L ed.1421, says, if the federal government does not follow this law, it has NO jurisdiction.
