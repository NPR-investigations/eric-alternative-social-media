But the tally of units built so far is ‚Äúwholly inadequate‚Äù in the context of the homeless crisis, said the audit issued by city Controller Ron Galperin.In recent years, homeless encampments have spread into virtually every neighborhood, while the population has climbed to an estimated 41,000 people. Many are drug addicted or mentally ill, and violence is commonplace.The program ‚Äúis still unable to meet the demands of the homelessness crisis,‚Äù Galperin said in a letter accompanying the 31-page report. The pace of development is sluggish, he said, while the cost of each unit continues to rise ‚Äî in some cases to ‚Äústaggering heights.‚ÄùMost of the units are studios or one-bedroom apartments. The audit found 14% of the units build exceeded $700,000 each, and one project in pre-development is estimated to cost almost $837,000 per unit.The audit noted that higher prices for construction materials during the pandemic, including lumber, along with labor shortages could be contributing to rising costs.In a tweet, Democratic Mayor Eric Garcetti appeared to dispute any suggestion that the program ‚Äì formally known by its title on the 2016 ballot, Proposition HHH ‚Äì was off track.The program ‚Äúis producing more units than promised, at a lower cost than expected,‚Äù Garcetti wrote. ‚ÄúThere are already 1,200 units online providing critical housing and services.

God is good and His mercy endures forever!\n***\nBy posting you are agreeing to our posting standards, and anything that violates them will be removed.\n***\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God‚Äôs mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.‚ÄùEphesians 3:20 TPT\n***\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \n***\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\n3. Low effort (a link without adequate description of what we will find when clicking said link; and, no, a sentence is rarely sufficient) or multiple posts in a row (any more than one post in a 3 hour time period results in the keeping of the most recent post and removal of the older until the time period is met)\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\n7. All members who block the administrators will be removed.\n***\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\n***\n‚ÄúThe Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. ‚ÄúSo shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.‚Äù‚ÄùNumbers 6:24-27 ESV",

My reasoning? I believe this: &quot;Never doubt God‚Äôs mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.‚ÄùEphesians 3:20 TPT<\/p><br /><hr><br /><p>PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:<br />Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):<\/p><ol><li>Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.<br /><\/li><li>Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don&#39;t respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don&#39;t post it. <br />***<br />It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God&#39;s heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else&#39;s well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:<br /><\/li><li>Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts<br /><\/li><li>Low effort (a link without adequate description of what we will find when clicking said link; and, no, a sentence is rarely sufficient) or multiple posts in a row (any more than one post in a 3 hour time period results in the keeping of the most recent post and removal of the older until the time period is met)<br /><\/li><li>Posts that don&#39;t meet the criteria mentioned above<br /><\/li><li>Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.<br /><\/li><li>Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)<br /><\/li><li>All members who block the administrators will be removed.<br />***<br />Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.<br />***<br />‚ÄúThe Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. ‚ÄúSo shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.‚Äù‚ÄùNumbers 6:24-27 ESV<br /><\/li><\/ol>",
