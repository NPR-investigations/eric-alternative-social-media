California’s total annual budget currently sits at roughly $300 million.The reparations task force is meeting Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the cost.“We’ve got to go in with an open mind and come up with some creative ways to deal with this,” California Assembly member Reggie Jones-Sawyer told The Associated Press.Jones-Sawyer sits on the reparations committee and is one of two lawmakers tasked with convincing Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state’s other lawmakers to adopt the jaw-dropping expenditure. The task force is facing a July 1 deadline for coming up with a dollar amount for how much the state should give its Black residents.“That’s going to be the real hurdle,” said Sen. Steven Bradford, another lawmaker who sits on the panel. “How do you compensate for hundreds of years of harm, even 150 years post-slavery?”The panel’s findings come roughly a month after a similar reparations panel in San Francisco called for granting $5 million to each of the city’s Black residents.The city’s African American Reparations Advisory Committee first unveiled its recommendation in January, arguing that the city owed compensation to Black residents for decades of discrimination. The committee’s chair, consultant Eric McDonnell, later clarified that the $5 million number came as a result of a “journey” rather than a “math formula.”While slavery was never legal in San Francisco, or anywhere else in California, reparations activists say the state nevertheless imposed decades of racist policies that economically harmed Black residents and favored their white counterparts.In addition to the $5 million payments, the San Francisco proposal also called for debt forgiveness. To be eligible for the proposed program, an applicant must be 18 years old and have identified as Black or African American on public documents for at least 10 years, among other criteria.https://resistthemainstream.com/economists-warn-about-jaw-dropping-cost-of-reparations-for-black-californians/",

To others, it appears to be about preserving their individualism.The Atheltic blamed players’ refusal to fall in line on Russia.But there is no denying many players in the country’s most conservative sports league are not interested in adorning rainbows before clashing on the ice.Some of them have outright refused to support the LGBT agenda, bringing howls from left-wing fans.Ivan Provorov of the Philadelphia Flyers was the first vocal opponent of the gimmick back in January.After the defenseman decided he just wanted to warm up in peace, he told reporters it was an easy decision and he didn’t wish to discuss it in detail.“I respect everybody’s choices,” Provorov said. “My choice is to stay true to myself and my religion. That’s all I’m going to say.”He was subsequently smeared as a hateful bigot.Related:Another NHL Team Decides Not to Wear 'Pride' Jerseys Days After Christian Goalie Takes Stand - ReportEarlier this month, San Jose goalie James Reimer cited his Christian faith for his decision not to wear “pride” gear before the Sharks hosted the New York Islanders.“I have no hate in my heart for anyone, and I have always strived to treat everyone that I encounter with respect and kindness. In this specific instance, I am choosing not to endorse something that is counter to my personal convictions which are based on the Bible, the highest authority in my life,” Reimer said in a statement.Last week, a pair of brothers who play for the Florida Panthers, Eric and Marc Staal, took a similar stand before a game against Toronto.“After many thoughts, prayers and discussions, we have chosen not to wear a pride jersey tonight,” they said in a joint statement. “We carry no judgment on how people choose to live their lives, and believe that all people should be welcome in all aspects of the game of hockey.

          "content": "3/30/23 The Daily Skirmish - How the Democrats Weaponize the Elections ProcessLinks at http://www.liberato.us/the-daily-skirmish.htmlToday, I argue the Democrats are weaponizing the elections process to rig elections in their favor.  Before I give you examples, let me first say that the recent exit of several states from ERIC - the thinly disguised get-out-the-vote effort for Democrats posing as a voter list maintenance operation - shows it is possible undo the weaponization.  The days of Republicans and the political Right playing the patsy are over.The first example of weaponization is federal DHS funding of a nonprofit called the Center for Internet Security to provide cybersecurity services to county elections offices free of charge.  The Center is not an honest broker.  It was instrumental in flagging supposed election ‘misinformation’ for the government / Big Tech censorship enterprise now well-known because of the release of the Twitter files and the Missouri court case.  So what we have here is censorship masquerading as cybersecurity.  This is the same artifice the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) uses in claiming that preventing ‘misinformation’ is somehow part of their mission to protect critical infrastructure.  Critics say states are perfectly capable of strengthening cybersecurity in the elections process on their own, citing Florida as an example.   Another left-wing nonprofit - U.S. Digital Response - purports to help local elections officials with better digital tools to run elections.  It’s funded by big money from the Left, including the Ford Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  It’s tied in with other left-wing entities which are all part of what has come to be called ‘Zuckerbucks’, the dubious private financing of elections.  Critics say US Digital Response in actuality works to help left-wing candidates win elections.  These are not the only nonprofits engaged in 501(c)(3) abuse - doing things never contemplated when tax-exempt status was initiated.   These so-called charities, which are supposed to be in the business of educating the public, have been weaponized to turn out likely Democrat voters in elections.  They are legally prohibited from conducting partisan voter registration drives, but get around the law by microtargeting certain demographics - “unmarried women, people of color, Millennials, Gen Z, and other historically under-represented groups in the electorate” - all of which lean Democrat.  Prominent nonprofits engaged in this effort include the Voter Participation Center and the Center for Voter Information.  They promote mail-in voting and ignore uncompetitive red states.  Critics have called for banning nonprofit voter registration drives.  State and local governments are also weaponizing elections.  A bill in the Democrat-controlled Michigan legislature would reduce citizen participation in the elections process under the guise of keeping election workers ‘safe’.  If enacted, all elections officials would have to do is claim they feel ‘intimidated’ or ‘harassed’ and citizen poll watchers could be slapped with felony charges.  Democrats keep saying elections officials are being threatened but haven’t produced much evidence of that, so far.  So this is a bill that addresses a non-problem but in actuality makes it easier for the Democrats to cheat in elections.East Lansing is compelling landlords to help register new tenants to vote, another likely Democrat constituency.  The landlords have sued, arguing this is unconstitutional compelled speech.  Chicago is pressuring inmates to vote in elections.  They are another likely Democrat constituency.  The inmates themselves are objecting, saying they are not registered to vote or are registered  elsewhere.  Critics say the city is engaged in illegal ballot harvesting and scooping up votes where there are no cameras or poll watchers.   Seattle has been handing out taxpayer-funded “democracy dollars” to another likely Democrat constituency - low-income residents - since 2015.

The days of Republicans and the political Right playing the patsy are over.<br />The first example of weaponization is federal DHS funding of a nonprofit called the Center for Internet Security to provide cybersecurity services to county elections offices free of charge.  The Center is not an honest broker.  It was instrumental in flagging supposed election ‘misinformation’ for the government / Big Tech censorship enterprise now well-known because of the release of the Twitter files and the Missouri court case.  So what we have here is censorship masquerading as cybersecurity.  This is the same artifice the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) uses in claiming that preventing ‘misinformation’ is somehow part of their mission to protect critical infrastructure.  Critics say states are perfectly capable of strengthening cybersecurity in the elections process on their own, citing Florida as an example.   <br />Another left-wing nonprofit - U.S. Digital Response - purports to help local elections officials with better digital tools to run elections.  It’s funded by big money from the Left, including the Ford Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  It’s tied in with other left-wing entities which are all part of what has come to be called ‘Zuckerbucks’, the dubious private financing of elections.  Critics say US Digital Response in actuality works to help left-wing candidates win elections.  <br />These are not the only nonprofits engaged in 501(c)(3) abuse - doing things never contemplated when tax-exempt status was initiated.   These so-called charities, which are supposed to be in the business of educating the public, have been weaponized to turn out likely Democrat voters in elections.  They are legally prohibited from conducting partisan voter registration drives, but get around the law by microtargeting certain demographics - “unmarried women, people of color, Millennials, Gen Z, and other historically under-represented groups in the electorate” - all of which lean Democrat.  Prominent nonprofits engaged in this effort include the Voter Participation Center and the Center for Voter Information.  They promote mail-in voting and ignore uncompetitive red states.  Critics have called for banning nonprofit voter registration drives.  <br />State and local governments are also weaponizing elections.  A bill in the Democrat-controlled Michigan legislature would reduce citizen participation in the elections process under the guise of keeping election workers ‘safe’.  If enacted, all elections officials would have to do is claim they feel ‘intimidated’ or ‘harassed’ and citizen poll watchers could be slapped with felony charges.  Democrats keep saying elections officials are being threatened but haven’t produced much evidence of that, so far.  So this is a bill that addresses a non-problem but in actuality makes it easier for the Democrats to cheat in elections.<br />East Lansing is compelling landlords to help register new tenants to vote, another likely Democrat constituency.  The landlords have sued, arguing this is unconstitutional compelled speech.  Chicago is pressuring inmates to vote in elections.  They are another likely Democrat constituency.  The inmates themselves are objecting, saying they are not registered to vote or are registered  elsewhere.
