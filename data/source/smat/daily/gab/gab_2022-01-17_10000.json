Ekim Alptekin was interviewed on the Dark to Light Podcast with Tracy Beanz. Alptekin addressed the current status of the case of his co-defendant Bijan Kian related to a private contract by the Flynn Intel Group (FIG) as well as an exclusive TWP report about a trip made by Jim &amp; Sara Biden (the brother of Joe Biden and his brother’s wife) midway through the Flynn case. In the D2L interview, Alptekin made never before heard accusations that seem to more closely tie former Attorney General and Obama’s self-described “wingman” Eric Holder into the scheme to setup retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn.\"<br /><br /><a href=\"https://twpundit.com/2022/01/08/new-evidence-emerges-of-eric-holders-role-in-flynn-setup\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>twpundit.com/2022/01/08/new-evidence-emerges-<span class=\"invisible\">of-eric-holders-role-in-flynn-setup<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

            "description": "Flavius on Gab: 'We need verifiable elections, not meaningless audits after the election.\nThe 2020 election is over. It's been nine months since the election and not a single vote has been changed. The next election cycle has already started. There is fraud in every election because our election process is not verifiable. No Democrat or Republican politician is talking about fixing our corrupt voting process to eliminate fraud in the future. Why not?? #VerifiedElections\n\nHow should our voting systems work?\nVoters should register to vote using Real ID (or one of its equivalents like a US Passport) so only citizens can vote, Real ID (https://www.dhs.gov/real-id) already exists, but is not used for voting yet.  Why not??\nEvery registered voter should be added to Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) so that a voter can only register once and vote only in a single precinct. ERIC (https://ericstates.org/) already exits, but is not used by all states for all voters yet.  Why not??\nAfter voting every voter should be able to log in to ERIC and verify that their ballot was correctly added to the reported election results after the election. You know, just like you log into your bank account to view your checks and balance or your credit card account to verify your charges. This does not exist.  Why not?? It could be added to the ERIC system.\nAmericans need to start demanding verifiable elections. Every voter should be able to verify their own ballot in every election. Every voter should be able to download all non-identifiable ballots and add the results for themselves in a spreadsheet. That way auditing each ballot is done by the voter who cast that ballot and every voter can verify the totals.'",

Alptekin addressed the current status of the case of his co-defendant Bijan Kian related to a private contract by the Flynn Intel Group (FIG) as well as an exclusive TWP report about a trip made by Jim &amp; Sara Biden (the brother of Joe Biden and his brother’s wife) midway through the Flynn case. In the D2L interview, Alptekin made never before heard accusations that seem to more closely tie former Attorney General and Obama’s self-described “wingman” Eric Holder into the scheme to setup retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn.<br /><br />This portion of the story began in February 2021, when Alptekin gave an interview in Turkish on YouTube to veteran journalist Cüneyt Özdemir. The interview would later be recounted in an article in Duvar English, the English language version of the Turkish publication Gazete Duvar. In the interview, Alptekin made the shocking admission about Jim and Sara Biden’s trip to Turkey and its timing. As TWP detailed in our reporting on the timeline of events, the visit took place at a pivotal moment as the DOJ’s prosecution (or more appropriately, persecution) of Gen. Flynn looked to be falling apar",

NYC Mayor Eric Adams is lashed for insisting subway IS safe and it’s only a 'perception' of danger after female Deloitte exec, 41, was pushed to her death in front of train.<br /><br /><br />NYC Mayor Eric Adams has been blasted for saying there's only a 'perception' of danger on the city's subway, the day after a passenger was pushed to her death in a seemingly random attack.  <br /><br />Speaking at a press conference in the wake of Saturday's murder, Adams said: 'New Yorkers are safe on the subway system I think it's about 1.7 percent of the crimes in New York City that occur on the subway system.<br /><br />'Think about that for a moment,' he added. 'What we must do is remove the perception of fear.<br /><br /><br />'Cases like this aggravate the perception of fear,' he said referring to the death of subway rider Michelle Go, 40 — who was unexpectedly killed when suspect Simon Martial, 61, allegedly pushed her in front of an oncoming MTA train on Saturday morning at the station on West 42nd St and Broadway.<br /><br />Go is believed to have been a senior manager at Deloitte Consulting. <br /><br />'When you see homeless individuals with mental health issues not being attended to and given the proper services, that adds to the perception of fear,' Adams said. <br /><br />Former Republican mayor candidate and Adam's arch-nemesis, Curtis Sliwa, was the first among many users on Twitter to criticize the relatively new mayor's comments, sharing on Sunday:<br /><br />'The WHO has a song that says 'the new boss is the same as the old boss.' Adams is saying what DeBlasio said for 8 yrs - <a href=\"/tags/mta\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#mta<\/a> crime is a perception &amp; not real. He won't confront Bragg &amp; covers up subway crime. What happened to the law &amp; order candidate?' <br /><br />He was referring to Adams' status as a former NYPD cop - and repeated promises to stamp-out spiraling crime in the Big Apple. <br /><br />Others also joined in Sliwa's condemnation of Adams, saying the feeling of danger on the Big Apple's subway is not a 'perception' as the mayor claims, but a 'reality' for many daily commuters.<br /><br />'It is a reality, not perception that way too many of your constituents are facing @NYCMayor,' the Victims Rights NYC PAC wrote. 'They did not elect you to further gaslight them. They hired you based on your promises of public safety &amp; they will fire you do not deliver.' <br /><br />Senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and NY Post columnist, Nicole Gelinas was also vocal of Adams' choice of words,",

The man believed responsible fled the scene but turned himself in to transit police a short time later, Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said at a news conference with Mayor Eric Adams at the station. The 40-year-old victim, identified as Michelle Alyssa Go of New York, was waiting for a southbound R train around 9:40 a.m. when she was apparently shoved, according to police. “This incident was unprovoked, and the victim does not appear to have had any interaction with the subject,” Sewell said. A second woman told police the man had approached her minutes earlier and she feared he would push her onto the tracks. “He approaches her and he gets in her space. She gets very, very alarmed,” Assistant Chief Jason Wilcox said, describing the earlier encounter. “She tries to move away from him and he gets close to her, and she feels that he was about to physically push her onto the train. As she’s walking away she witnesses the crime where he pushes our other victim in front of the train.”",

They have no place here.<br />‘They are thieves, they are murderers, they are rapists, that's all they are – they must all be sent back, and they shouldn’t come in the first place.’<br />Complaints poured in, including from numerous local authorities in France who are charged with looking after child migrants.<br />‘These are young people who have the right to protection and a dignified welcome,’ said Stéphane Troussel, president of the Seine-Saint-Denis departmental council.<br />‘We cannot tolerate the combined actions and racism which this gravedigger of the French Republic is accustomed,’ Mr Troussel added.<br />In turn, Zemmour denied any wrongdoing, while his defence counsel argued that the trial has become politicised because of their client’s presidential ambitions.<br /><a href=\"http://www.stationgossip.com/2022/01/far-right-french-presidential-hopeful.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>stationgossip.com/2022/01/far-right-french-pr<span class=\"invisible\">esidential-hopeful.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

          "content": "After COVID Shot Rollout, Deaths Up 40% Among Those Aged 18-64 In 2021 Based On Life Insurance Claims- Sons of Liberty<br /><br />Well, it’s not like we did not warn all through 2020 and all through 2021 of the dangers that would come from experimental mRNA shots, fraudulently called “vaccines.”  Many listened, many did not, and sadly many who did not listen are no longer alive.  Based on life insurance claims in 2021, deaths among those aged 18-64 are up a whopping 40%!<br />The increase in insurance claims are not solely related to deaths, according to Davison, but disability claims are also increasing.  Dr. Lindsay Weaver, Indiana’s chief medical officer, said at a recent news conference with Gov. Eric Holcomb that hospitalizations have increased after the roll out of the COVID-19 vaccines.<br />If we look at VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System), the percentage of reported deaths among the workforce age is much higher following COVID-19 shots for the past year than the average of deaths reported per year during the previous 31 years.<br />Looking at deaths reported following COVID-19 shots for those between the ages of 18 and 65 for one year, VAERS reports 3,294 deaths.  For the previous 31 years prior to the COVID-19 shots, there were a total of 851 deaths among the workforce age group reported following vaccinations, which is an average of 27 deaths per year.<br />That’s actually a 12,100% increase in reported deaths following vaccinations!  And if we consider the fact that VAERS is vastly under-reported and take into consideration the “unreported factor” as Dr. Jessica Rose has calculated, we need to multiply these reported deaths by X41 which means that about 135,054 people of workforce age died following a COVID-19 shot this past year.<br />2021 was devastating for people across the earth due to the COVID shots, not the alleged, non-proven SARS-CoV-2.",

Armitage was the target of Embassy personnel complaints to the effect that he was utterly failing to perform his duties on behalf of American MIAs, and he reluctantly resigned as the D.O.D. Special Consultant on MIA's at the end of 1977.<br /><br />From 1977 until 1979, Armitage remained in Bangkok opening and operating a business named The Far East Trading Company. This company had offices only in Bangkok and in Washington, D.C. This company was, in fact, from 1977 to 1979, merely a \"front\" for Armitage's secret operations conducting Vang Pao opium money out of Southeast Asia to Tehran and the Nugen-Hand Bank in Australia to fund the ultra right-wing, private anti-communist \"anti-terrorist\" assassination program and \"unconventional warfare\" operation of Theodore Shackley's and Thomas Cline's \"Secret Team\". During this period, between 1975 and 1979, in Bangkok, Richard Armitage lived in the home of Hynnie Aderholdt the former Air Wing Commander of Shackley`s \"Special Operations Group\" in Laos who, between 1966 and 1968, had served as the immediate superior to Richard Secord, the Deputy Air Wing Commander of MAG / SOG. Secord, in 1975, was transferred from Vietnam to Tehran, Iran.<br /><br />In 1976, Richard Secord moved to Tehran, Iran and became the Deputy Assistant Secretary of defense in Iran, in charge of the Middle Eastern Division of the Defense Security Assistance Administration. In this capacity, Secord functioned as the chief operations officer for the U.S. Defense Department in the Middle East in charge of foreign military sales of U.S. aircraft, weapons and military equipment to Middle Eastern nations allied to the U.S.. Secord's immediate superior was Eric Van Marbad the former 40 Committee liaison officer to Theodore Shackley's Phoenix program in Vietnam from 1973 to 1975.",
