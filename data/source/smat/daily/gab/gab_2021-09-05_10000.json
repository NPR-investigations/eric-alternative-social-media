We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs.\n\nAll of our oceans and lakes do actually survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth, only Earth quakes. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored.\n\nSome may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier.

Names that popped up all over were l, you guessed it… Serbian. On this call, they said people would be “watching them” for their own safety. <br /><br />Now we get to the admission of destroying evidence. Eric admitted that prior to filing the fictitious lawsuit against me, he permanently deleted his social posts. He destroyed evidence. Then he filled a lawsuit. Completely illegal and disqualifying but, hey let’s not let law and preservation of evidence get in the way. <br /><br />Now we deal with a corrupt judiciary… a lawyer for Eric who lies at every turn and all for not lying… and for standing up. <br /><br />And at the end of what is in my brain at the moment is the knowledge that the election was 100% stolen. It does not matter how many times they lie and say “nothign to see here”. They have to do that, because even letting up for a minute will quicken the result of accountability. <br /><br />Make no mistake, we will win. God will win. But anything good and worth it never happened easily. It is the hard work and determination to end the evil we face that will show the character and courage of our countrymen and women fighting for a restoration of our nation and an end to the perversions of our communities. <br /><br />God wins… we win, and what we are seeing is an awakening of courage and sacrifice to defeat this evil terroristic cancer in our society.",

          "content": "Joe Oltmann on Dominion Thuggery<br />Part 2 of 3<br /><br />Now let’s talk about actions. I’ve talked to several people personally who said Eric likes to bully people, prone to rage and drinks profusely. Allegedly He once punched a contractor who he said hit on his girlfriend. He supposedly bought a bar, got in a fight with not one but two of his employees while in a drunken rage. This was not 10 years ago… <br /><br />Keep in mind, I had no idea the significance of Eric or Dominion for that matter. I did not know of his history, initially I did not have access to his social media, did not know even initially he was the inventor of the adjudication process for Dominion. I did not know about him being a skinhead, a person who writes about sexually humiliating and abusing his wife. I did not know he was a heroine addict nor did I know he went to jail for DUIs. I did not know any of this. <br /><br />Now I do… and it matters. <br /><br />I knew he said he had a Doctorate in Nuclear Physics. Turned out to be that was a lie. Not a big lie, but significant enough for the nuclear community. His Doctorate was actually in Nuclear Engineering. Still impressive as it requires advanced math and computation skills, but it is NOT Nuclear Physics. That is a whole other animal of impressive. <br /><br />I know he wrote a voluntary op-Ed in the Denver Post. His own words, driven by the purity of the whitest snow that he was a victim and those social postings were all fabricated. Only, that too was a lie… a rather large lie. A lie that caused a firestorm of rage and danger for me and my family. He later admitted those were in fact his social posts. <br /><br />But that lie does not stop there. He went on to say later, those posts were “satire”.<br /><br />And even later than that, that they were no longer satire but were him voicing his frustration with Trump and our country. So the lie became another lie that dwarfed into yet another… lie? The only person that does that, is someone who is hiding, truth. <br /><br />Let me dig a little deeper here… before the election, Dominion hired a firm to look into the social media of its employees. They met with some of them who openly posted things related to politics. In these meetings they recommended that they, “lock down, deactivate or close” social media accounts. It was preemptive… almost as if they knew. Now only someone with access to Dominion employees would know this. My question is simple… didn’t they have this conversation with Eric? If they didn’t, why?",

But, they killed him &amp; tried to made it look like suicide. &amp; that was in the 1950's! His story is on Netflix too. \"Wormwood\". His son Eric dedicated his life to uncover what really happened to his father, &amp; to try &amp; get those responsible punished! Problem is, it was the CIA who did it!

          "content": "An East Tennessee woman said she refused multiple opportunities to escape Afghanistan in an effort to save military contract dogs left behind during the hasty American withdrawal.<br /><br />Clinton, Tennessee native Charlotte Maxwell-Jones is the director and founder of Kabul Small Animal Rescue in Kabul, Afghanistan, where she has lived for 11 years.<br /><br />She said she’s staying behind until roughly 130 dogs, about 50 of which are military contract dogs, are safely evacuated.<br /><br />“They’re my responsibility and I love them and I care for them. I think there’s a less chance of recovering them if I’m not here,” said Maxwell-Jones.<br /><br /> <br />Maxwell-Jones told WVLT News that military contract dogs, like working dogs owned by the military, are trained to sniff bombs and perform crucial tasks to help neutralize threats for U.S. troops while overseas. However, she said that military contract dogs aren’t given the same priority as military dogs.<br /><br />The main difference between a contract dog and a military dog is who owns it. According to Department of Defense spokesperson Eric Pahon, contract dogs are hired from outside companies to do work for the military, but the military does not own them.<br /><br />Since the military does not own the contract animals or have access to their health records, they must take charter flights, not military ones, out of the country, Pahon told WVLT News. However, he did confirm that the department has worked with Kabul Small Animal Rescue to move the contract dogs into a safer, fenced in area.<br /><br />Officials with the Military Working Dog Team Support Association said that they are confident that all military working dogs were evacuated.<br /><br />Department of Defense Spokesperson Eric Pahon told WVLT News that all military dogs were removed from Afghanistan.<br /><br />Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby made a similar statement on Twitter, saying that U.S. military dogs were not left behind at the Kabul airport. He referenced the above photos circulating online and said they showed dogs under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not the U.S. military.<br /><br />“To correct erroneous reports, the U.S, Military did not leave any dogs in cages at Hamid Karzai International Airport, including the reported military working dogs. Photos circulating online were animals under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not dogs under our care,” the post read.  <a href=\"https://www.wbrc.com/2021/09/02/east-tennessee-woman-stays-afghanistan-save-military-contract-dogs/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>wbrc.com/2021/09/02/east-tennessee-woman-stay<span class=\"invisible\">s-afghanistan-save-military-contract-dogs/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

I have gone back and forth, over and over again… I ask myself the simple question, what if this is that bullets collide in mid air moment. What if I was wrong about Eric on the call being the Eric at Dominion. I validated the information, listened intently to videos. I did research to make sure it was actually him. Yet at the time, it was not significant. I was however 100% sure this is who was on the call. What are the chances… and why? Haunted by all of it honestly.  I wish I wasn’t and frankly I wish I did not have this obligation to serve others unselfishly. <br /><br />The deeper we get into the election fraud, the more sinister it all appears and the more validated it all becomes. I’ve become somewhat of an architectural expert on election systems which leads me to wonder how anyone can use any of them. They are all flawed in the most basic forms of security. <br /><br />And… Why was one man at Dominion traveling all over the world (not nation but world) selling, installing, updating, demonstrating, negotiating and representing the company? How does one man wear that many hats in a billion dollar company? <br /><br />I was a successful tech company CEO. I understand consolidation of authority and access. Those jobs he was doing were not the type of jobs you would consolidate, ever. The only reason you would consolidate those positions is to keep the circle tight, and limit the amount of information available on the company to the public. There are only two types of environments where this happens. One is organized crime and the other is government op. I’ll let you all stew on that for a minute… <br /><br />This is a company with over 200 employees, where code was written in Serbia, where the primary data center was built and maintained by a Serbian company who’s number parter was Huawei, the US restricted and sanctioned bank and investment firm in China. A company who in the US is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominion Voting in Canada. A company who’s HQ in Canada sat on the same floor as a Soros shell non profit. Coincidence…<br /><br />We are talking about a guy who was the speaker invited by Chris Krebs himself to speak at a conference. Hacker Conferences, public hearings.. you name it. We are talking about the Swiss Army knife of positions.",

So, we must be prepared to deal with any type of viral threat,” he added.<br />Lander, who is also the director of White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), shared the administration’s new plan (pdf) titled, “American Pandemic Preparedness: Transforming our Capabilities,” to protect the country against biological and pandemic threats.<br />The cost of the plan is $65.3 billion over seven to 10 years.<br />“It’s vital that we start with an initial outlay of $15 to $20 billion to jumpstart these efforts,”...<br /><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/biden-admin-releases-65-billion-plan-to-handle-future-pandemics_3981109.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theepochtimes.com/biden-admin-releases-65-bil<span class=\"invisible\">lion-plan-to-handle-future-pandemics_3981109.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

(AP) — The first group of Afghan refugees bound for Camp Atterbury in southern Indiana arrived in the state Thursday.<br /><br />A plane carrying the refugees landed Thursday afternoon at Indianapolis International Airport. The refugees were processed and then boarded buses for the drive to the base about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the capital.<br /><br />The refugees were expected to arrive in groups of 1,000 at a time, and about 5,000 are expected in the coming weeks, officials said this week. The refugees include American citizens, Afghan allies who helped in the military effort, and those deemed vulnerable Afghans by the U.S. government.<br />Gov. Eric Holcomb said Camp Atterbury will house the refugees until they are placed in more permanent housing.<br /><br />“As Hoosiers, we are proud to do our part and provide a temporary home for Afghan evacuees who have supported this nation,” Holcomb said Wednesday.<br /><br />Active duty and National Guard service members at Camp Atterbury will provide housing, medical needs, logistics and transportation.<br /><br />The refugees are subject to a 14-day quarantine at Camp Atterbury to determine their medical and visa statuses. Non-governmental agencies will aim to resettle them within 10 weeks, Indiana National Guard Adjutant Gen. R. Dale Lyles.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/09/03/first-afghan-refugees-bound-for-camp-atterbury-start-arriving/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>militarytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/09/03/f<span class=\"invisible\">irst-afghan-refugees-bound-for-camp-atterbury-start-arriving/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Additionally, students will not be allowed to return to their class, regardless of the teacher’s option. “If the student refuses to wear their mask properly for the Administrator, then that student will be removed from school until the mask mandate is lifted,” Hofer-Holderman adds, in italics.<\/p><p>A third “noncompliance” will result in an “In-person meeting with admin, student, and student’s parent(s) or guardian(s)” and if the student refuses to wear the mask “properly” in front of the administrator, again, the student will be removed from school.<\/p><p>If the student dares let their mask slip a fourth time, then Hofer-Holderman declares, “Student may no longer attend in-person until the mask mandate is lifted. Further, their absences will be considered unexcused, learning remotely with NWHS teachers will not be an option. Only those students who are required to quarantine will be allowed to log into Teams and join a class remotely.”<\/p><p>Additionally, the About page for USD-259 reveals that <b><em>the district’s stated mission is, “Inspiring future leaders and empowering each student with the 21st century skills and knowledge necessary for success.”<\/em><\/b> [LOL] National File asked Arensman and USD-259 if removing students from school over a refusal to “properly” wear a face mask advances this mission and did not receive an immediate response.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://nationalfile.com/largest-school-district-in-kansas-will-effectively-expel-students-who-violate-mask-mandate/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>nationalfile.com/largest-school-district-in-k<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">ansas-will-effectively-expel-students-who-violate-mask-mandate/<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><\/p>"
