It's been nine months since the election and not a single vote has been changed. The next election cycle has already started. There is fraud in every election because our election process is not verifiable. No Democrat or Republican politician is talking about fixing our corrupt voting process to eliminate fraud in the future. Why not?? #VerifiedElections\n\nHow should our voting systems work?\nVoters should register to vote using Real ID (or one of its equivalents like a US Passport) so only citizens can vote, Real ID (https://www.dhs.gov/real-id) already exists, but is not used for voting yet.  Why not??\nEvery registered voter should be added to Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) so that a voter can only register once and vote only in a single precinct. ERIC (https://ericstates.org/) already exits, but is not used by all states for all voters yet.  Why not??\nAfter voting every voter should be able to log in to ERIC and verify that their ballot was correctly added to the reported election results after the election. You know, just like you log into your bank account to view your checks and balance or your credit card account to verify your charges. This does not exist.  Why not?? It could be added to the ERIC system.\nAmericans need to start demanding verifiable elections. Every voter should be able to verify their own ballot in every election. Every voter should be able to download all non-identifiable ballots and add the results for themselves in a spreadsheet. That way auditing each ballot is done by the voter who cast that ballot and every voter can verify the totals.'",

Frankly this is like all that \"Q-Tard\" shit of \"Trust the Plan\" whereas looking at the world where millions are out in force demanding their freedom from medical tyranny...<br />Americans are on the couch watching TV or trying to enlarge their cocks.<br /><br />They should be organizing before they come for our guns as Kyle Rittenhouse wasn't on trial the AR-15 was. They can't do a full lockdown like Australia, Germany, Austria, France, UK and other areas until they disarm America.<br /><br />Plan therefore some BIG EVENT larger then anything they have pulled before as in Tasmania and Christ Church, for it was the day after each event that they came for the guns and they wrestle with their internment camps now.<br /><br />You should be addressing those in BLM, Antifa, Proud Boys and other Americans to join forces as we are indeed \"All in this together.\" Where cute phrases before like Bush Jr. on the grounds of 9/11 rallied the masses saying \"You are either with us or against us.\" False Patriotism that saw the lies of 9/11 launch the US into 2 wars killing millions and in the wake of such those patriot soldier who the VA allowed 307,000 to die, over 60,000 suicides, 274 Marines dumped in a Virginia landfill and a government who calls them veterans a threat who are now disarmed for medical use of weed.<br /><br />From Janet Reno, Eric Holder, Clinton and now Biden... They are coming for your guns as they themselves armed the terrorist groups all over the Middle East.  They can't get  their World Government until all countries bow to the NWO which includes destroying houses of worship as the New God is that World Government.<br /><br />At least Al Qaeda has \"Due Process Rights.\"<br /><br />You can go back to your TV show now.<br />Morning.",

          "content": "The Left Goes to War with Guy Who Got Biden to Say “Let’s Go Brandon, I Agree”Andrew Anglin December 27, 2021On Christmas Eve, Jared Schmeck, a former cop, called into the NORAD Santa tracker with his kids and ended up live on stream with Joe and Jill Biden. After a nice and cordial call about what his kids wanted from Santa, he ended the call with “Let’s Go Brandon.”Here’s the recording of the call he posted to his YouTube channel. It’s obvious this is a good, all American guy, with a normal family, who was just having a bit of fun.In what might be the funniest moment of my life, Joe Biden replied: “Let’s Go Brandon – I agree.”https://youtu.be/F1ulpuUKI4QSchmeck has told the media that people are now calling him up and harassing him about it.I’m not one for moralfagging about “internet death threats,” but this guy doesn’t seem to be making those kinds of histrionic claims. He’s just saying that people are spam calling him and his family business. (That’s apparently how the left spent Christmas Day – they’re of course all hiding in their homes from the deadly Omicron variant.)What’s more, and what’s most important: it is the media that is driving this. They are the ones publishing nonstop articles about how evil this guy is for getting Joe Biden to say this phrase.They’ve got a hashtag up attacking him. Many are openly calling for harassment. They know what this means.

          "contentraw": "The Left Goes to War with Guy Who Got Biden to Say “Let’s Go Brandon, I Agree”<br /><br />Andrew Anglin <br />December 27, 2021<br /><br />On Christmas Eve, Jared Schmeck, a former cop, called into the NORAD Santa tracker with his kids and ended up live on stream with Joe and Jill Biden. After a nice and cordial call about what his kids wanted from Santa, he ended the call with “Let’s Go Brandon.”<br /><br />Here’s the recording of the call he posted to his YouTube channel. It’s obvious this is a good, all American guy, with a normal family, who was just having a bit of fun.<br /><br />In what might be the funniest moment of my life, Joe Biden replied: “Let’s Go Brandon – I agree.”<br /><br /><a href=\"https://youtu.be/F1ulpuUKI4Q\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>youtu.be/F1ulpuUKI4Q<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Schmeck has told the media that people are now calling him up and harassing him about it.<br /><br />I’m not one for moralfagging about “internet death threats,” but this guy doesn’t seem to be making those kinds of histrionic claims. He’s just saying that people are spam calling him and his family business. (That’s apparently how the left spent Christmas Day – they’re of course all hiding in their homes from the deadly Omicron variant.)<br /><br />What’s more, and what’s most important: it is the media that is driving this. They are the ones publishing nonstop articles about how evil this guy is for getting Joe Biden to say this phrase.<br /><br />They’ve got a hashtag up attacking him. Many are openly calling for harassment. <br /><br />They know what this means. They’re publishing his personal information.<br /><br />They know what is implied here.<br /><br />The most tedious thing is how the left – which is literally totally Jewish and hates Jesus – invokes Jesus’ name as a way to say you have to support the Anal Vax Abortion Lord Brandon.<br /><br />What this shows is that the left has zero sense of humor.<br /><br />It also shows that what they are really angry about is the fact that Biden is so senile that he somehow didn’t recognize the phrase. <br /><br />After the otherwise friendly call, which ended with the light-hearted joke (seriously, watch the video), a non-senile Joe Biden would have laughed and said “hey, guy – I’m doing my best!” Instead, he gave the most senile possible response.<br /><br />It is the exposure of how ridiculous this all is that has these people freaking out.<br /><br />Most amazingly of all… Eric Swalwell is whining about this.<br /><br />The left doesn’t only choose the worst heroes.<br /><br />They also choose the worst enemies.<br /><br />Waging a war on Jared Schmeck is literally just saying “we hate normal white people – especially good-natured and friendly white fathers with white children.”<br /><br />UPDATE: <br /><br />Jewish Atlantic editor Ron Brownstein told CNN that this joke was an insurrection, and implied it was a kind of terrorism.<br /><br />That’s where we’re at with these Jews.<br /><br />Who is the real terrorist? <br /><br /><a href=\"https://dailystormer.su/the-left-goes-to-war-with-guy-who-got-biden-to-say-lets-go-brandon-i-agree/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>dailystormer.su/the-left-goes-to-war-with-guy<span class=\"invisible\">-who-got-biden-to-say-lets-go-brandon-i-agree/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
