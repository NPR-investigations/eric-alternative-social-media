Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",

Spitting on all Americans and calling all Americans Stupid, as anyone with two brain cells connected, and common sense, knows that Biden couldn't ever get winning numbers.   America is at War. America is under Enemy Occupation and control FFS, and this is the capitulating pussy grandstanding acts which mean nothing, but more Treason and Sedition.  Aiding and abetting the installed illegitimate non-uniformed, Enemy Combatants.  There is no representation, no Dem / republican paradigm any more, it doesn't exist. Traitors one and all. It's Treason and Sedition writ Large everyday now too.  Treason and Sedition should be screamed from every outlet available, every friggin day!  There is no Biden presidency, Whitehouse, administration, cabinet, office, department nor policy.  A junta perhaps. Not one traitorous, quisling snake, so-called representative has called out obvious Usurpation of the presidency,or Treason and Sedition everyday either.  Not one traitorous, quisling snake, so-called representative has called out obvious Crimes against Humanity targeting Our Children FFS too.  No arrests for Soros, the foreign actor, homosexual phoney poser AKA Obama, Hillary, Leon Pannetta, Susan Rice, Eric Holder, Valerie Jarrett and so many others too.   The entire structure is illegitimate, non-uniformed Enemy Combatant controlled territory now.",

(Ballotpedia)The Biden Recession is here. Unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7%. Although the labor force participation rate rose to 62.4% in August, 50% of employers anticipate job cuts in the next six months.

At least 3 buses of illegals were unloaded in front of Kamala's Naval Observatory residence. Don't let up now, Gov. Abbott ❗Eric Adams has opened 14 luxury hotels in NYC free to the illegals.  TX Gov Abbott has now added Chicago to the destination list for illegals.  Mayor Lightfoot is immediately busing them out to the suburbs.Ron DeSantis sent 2 planes of illegals to Martha's Vineyard and the dems went berserk. 125 National Guard were immediately deployed to escort the 50 illegals out of the snobby neighborhood that says they welcome ALL.

The FBI seized Mike Lindell's phone in Minnesota.

Amen.<br />1 Timothy 1:17<br /><br />🌄 Morning prayer<br />Lord, help us reach our destinations, honor our responsibilities and have a kind word for all those who cross our paths today.*<br />🙏 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.<br /><br />🌄  If you don't honor your word you are without honor. <br />Let's all make the day count.*<br /><br />*Charlie Daniels<br /><br />📣 It's Thursday, September 29, 2022, and the Obama/Biden administration was/(is) the most corrupt in US history. <a href=\"/tags/Obamagate\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Obamagate<\/a>.<br />- Dan Bongino<br /><br />⏱💣 1 Year and 252 Days of a \"hostage situation.\" -Juanita Broaddrick<br /><br />🇺🇸🖋️Biden Executive actions: 578 as of September 26, 2022, including 99 executive orders, 102 presidential memoranda, 316 proclamations, and 61 notices. (Ballotpedia)<br />The Biden Recession is here. Unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7%. Although the labor force participation rate rose to 62.4% in August, 50% of employers anticipate job cuts in the next six months. <br />Feds have raised the interest rate 5 times this year, .75 percentage points for the 3rd straight time.  Mortgage interest rates are over 6%. Inflation is 8.3%.<br /><br />Gas is $3.77/gallon.⬆️ (AAA) It's ALREADY going back up.<br /><br />RCP averages: Joe's job approval rating spread is  -10.3%.<br />His job approval avg.: 42.9%.  (ABC News/Wash Post says 39%, -16 spread.)<br /><br />Build The Wall<br />DC mayor Bowser is upset that her city shelters are being \"overrun\" with illegal  aliens. At least 3 buses of illegals were unloaded in front of Kamala's Naval Observatory residence. Don't let up now, Gov. Abbott ❗<br />Eric Adams has opened 14 luxury hotels in NYC free to the illegals.  TX Gov Abbott has now added Chicago to the destination list for illegals.  Mayor Lightfoot is immediately busing them out to the suburbs.<br />Ron DeSantis sent 2 planes of illegals to Martha's Vineyard and the dems went berserk. 125 National Guard were immediately deployed to escort the 50 illegals out of the snobby neighborhood that says they welcome ALL. <br />Next stop: Joe's place in Wilmington, DE, or Rehobeth Beach ❓ DeSantis makes light of any lawsuits or investigations targeting him. I say, sue the Big Guy in the OO❗ Nearly 5 MILLION illegals have skipped across Joe's border already. <br /><br />On Covid<br />Ahead of the election, the CDC relaxes its stance on Covid -19 ❗  The 🐘 in the room: \"Young, healthy people are dying in large numbers by collapsing\". No, the NIH still does NOT advise using ivermectin to treat Covid-19 except in clinical trials. The NIH is years behind the data and efficacy, and thousands have died because of it.  <br />➡️ The UK starts paying out big bucks for injuries and deaths caused by the experimental Covid jab.⬅️<br /><br />Law and Order<br />Why are Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell the only 2 people convicted of child sex trafficking?  There is a  l o n g  list of clients.<br /><br />Current events.<br />Joe has spent 1.5 trillion dollars for 99 executive orders ❗  As congress controls the purse strings, t h a t  should be challenged NOW. <br />Biden gave his \"RED\" speech on the \"soul of the nation\" at Independence Hall, Philadelphia, calling out MAGA as radicals.  <br />The January 6 political prisoners are  s t i l l  locked up with no charges, unlike the lib that purposely ran over an 18 yr. old Trump supporter and killed him with his truck. <br />The FBI seized Mike Lindell's phone in Minnesota. Unconstitutional ❗<br />Election Rigging- through FOIA requests, we now know that Bill Barr never investigated any of the rigged election claims, even though he told Trump and Americans that he did, and he stated it in his book.
