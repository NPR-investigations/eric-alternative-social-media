Le ministre de l’Éducation Nationale, Pap Ndiaye, est descendu bien bas lors de son interview dans «Le Grand Jury» ce dimanche sur Le Figaro et LCI. Il a notamment déclaré «n’avoir aucune estime pour Eric Zemmour» et a affirmé que les hommages du chef de Reconquête à Samuel Paty constituaient une «récupération politique». Ainsi, un ministre de la République s’abaisse et abaisse surtout sa fonction en s’adonnant à des attaques personnelles sur l’un de ses opposants les plus importants dans le paysage politique. De plus, il esquive la question de fond sur le francocide et Samuel Paty, bien entendu car il aurait été très difficile pour lui d’y répondre quand on connait son idéologie. Retrouvez l’intervention ridicule de Pap Ndiaye : ??

There, the veteran cop finds nailing a jelly to the wall far easier than stopping a merc’ on a mission.\r\nIn the predator’s cross-hairs are the most sinister but successful sinners of Liverpool’s underworld. ‘Mess with the best, die like the rest’ appears to be Jack Scarlett’s maxim as after being crossed in love and trust he evens the score.\r\nThe killer question is, can Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen stop Jack Scarlett, and does he really want to.

Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.<br /><br />Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: San-dra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.<br /><br />CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this re-sult in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abor-tion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”<br /><br />This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how<span class=\"invisible\">-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] <a href=\"https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them <a href=\"https://logcabin.org/?s=trump\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>logcabin.org/?s=trump<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />An Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5<span class=\"invisible\">787ab75e4b0867123dff357<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celeb<span class=\"invisible\">rates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

          "content": "Marvel heads revealed to be closely connected to Israeli intelligenceMany individuals who have held or still maintain roles at Marvel are associated with the Israeli military, Israeli intelligence and Zionist institutions that uphold apartheid.By Jessica BuxbaumEarlier this month, activists and comic book fans alike were in uproar over Marvel Studios’ announcement that Israeli actress Shira Haas will play Zionist superhero Sabra in the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Captain America: New World Order. Many Palestine advocates accused Marvel’s decision to add Sabra to the MCU as exalting Israeli abuse and war crimes.“By glorifying the Israeli army &amp; police, Marvel is promoting Israel’s violence against Palestinians &amp; enabling the continued oppression of millions of Palestinians living under Israel’s authoritarian military rule,” the Institute for Middle East Understanding wrote in a tweet.Following the backlash, Marvel said in a statement to Variety that it will take a “new approach” to the character, in a perceived attempt to placate criticisms.Yet vows to reimagine the Sabra character, a former spy for the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, may come across as disingenuous, especially when, upon closer examination, Marvel appears closely connected to the Israeli government and its main intelligence agency Mossad.MARVEL AND ISRAEL’S DEEPENING RELATIONSHIPMany individuals who have held or still maintain roles at Marvel are associated with the Israeli military, Israeli intelligence and Zionist institutions that uphold apartheid. For instance, Isaac Perlmutter, the current chairman of Marvel Entertainment who served on Marvel Comics’ board of directors until 1995, grew up in 1948-occupied Palestine (or modern-day Israel) and served in the Israeli military during the 1967 Six-Day War. Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Entertainment, also grew up in modern-day Israel and served in the Israeli army during the Six-Day War.Along with his wife, Laura, Perlmutter oversees a foundation that contributes to several pro-Israel causes such as the Anti-Defamation League, Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, the America-Israel Friendship League, the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County in Florida, and the Jewish Agency for Israel. The Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Foundation has also supported the Hebrew University and Israel’s Technion Institute of Technology.The Perlmutters are also heavily linked to the Trump family.

          "contentraw": "Marvel heads revealed to be closely connected to Israeli intelligence<br /><br />Many individuals who have held or still maintain roles at Marvel are associated with the Israeli military, Israeli intelligence and Zionist institutions that uphold apartheid.<br /><br />By Jessica Buxbaum<br /><br />Earlier this month, activists and comic book fans alike were in uproar over Marvel Studios’ announcement that Israeli actress Shira Haas will play Zionist superhero Sabra in the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Captain America: New World Order. Many Palestine advocates accused Marvel’s decision to add Sabra to the MCU as exalting Israeli abuse and war crimes.<br /><br />“By glorifying the Israeli army &amp; police, Marvel is promoting Israel’s violence against Palestinians &amp; enabling the continued oppression of millions of Palestinians living under Israel’s authoritarian military rule,” the Institute for Middle East Understanding wrote in a tweet.<br /><br />Following the backlash, Marvel said in a statement to Variety that it will take a “new approach” to the character, in a perceived attempt to placate criticisms.<br /><br />Yet vows to reimagine the Sabra character, a former spy for the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, may come across as disingenuous, especially when, upon closer examination, Marvel appears closely connected to the Israeli government and its main intelligence agency Mossad.<br /><br />MARVEL AND ISRAEL’S DEEPENING RELATIONSHIP<br /><br />Many individuals who have held or still maintain roles at Marvel are associated with the Israeli military, Israeli intelligence and Zionist institutions that uphold apartheid. For instance, Isaac Perlmutter, the current chairman of Marvel Entertainment who served on Marvel Comics’ board of directors until 1995, grew up in 1948-occupied Palestine (or modern-day Israel) and served in the Israeli military during the 1967 Six-Day War. Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Entertainment, also grew up in modern-day Israel and served in the Israeli army during the Six-Day War.<br /><br />Along with his wife, Laura, Perlmutter oversees a foundation that contributes to several pro-Israel causes such as the Anti-Defamation League, Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, the America-Israel Friendship League, the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County in Florida, and the Jewish Agency for Israel. The Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Foundation has also supported the Hebrew University and Israel’s Technion Institute of Technology.<br /><br />The Perlmutters are also heavily linked to the Trump family. In 2016, their organization donated $25,000 to the Eric Trump Foundation. According to Open Secrets, a campaign finance tracker, in 2016, Laura Perlmutter donated $5,400 to former President Donald Trump’s campaign and nearly $450,000 to the Trump Victory Committee, a joint fundraising initiative by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.
