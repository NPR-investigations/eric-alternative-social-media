This private company frequently stuffs the voter rolls in states it works for and never cleans the voter rolls. When asked for reports from ERIC to review their work, the requests are often ignored. E.R.I.C. which ultimately provides a name for a ballot that may be casted unlawfully, is a trojan horse for election fraud disguised as an honest agency. E.R.I.C. is currently active in thirty states in the U.S.A. and it needs to go.https://rumble.com/v14x7yv-e.r.i.c.-the-trojan-horse-election-registration-system.html",

Be on the lookout for fedposters using threats or calling for violence & report them using the report button in the top right corner of the post. .This Gab group is not affiliated with or run by any organization. Stop The Steal movements have become a target of the media and platforms like Facebook have banned any mention of STS, so naturally this group could become a target of agent provocateurs.

The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party‚Äôs first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party‚Äôs first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party‚Äôs national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party‚Äôs Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‚Äòalternative‚Äô parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode‚Äôs running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle‚Äôs running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

Two huge Mets stars and their vastly underrated CF from Wyoming refused to answer if  they took the potential poison, so let's assume they did not \"conform\"? Only player open about his disdain for the shot was J.D. Davis. Davis was traded in July, but there is no reason to believe he was dealt due to refusing the shot -- kind of like C. Beasley was/is being blackballed by the NFL.Former Major League star outfielder Paul O'Neil is a broadcaster for the Yankees. He hadn't been to Yankee Stadium since 2019, until a few weeks ago when he had his number (21) retired. The Yankees are such trash, they ordered their current players and broadcasters to \"not touch O'Neil\". No handshakes.He's been broadcasting from his basement since 2020, which sounds like a great \"gig' -- no travel, planes, ect. O'Neill has known  Yankee Andrew Benintendi (the only unvaccinated Yankee?) since he was kid, as Andrew is from Cincinnati and competed against Paul's son in basketball.Reason O'Neill is \"stuck in the basement\" is because he wont take the shot! By the way, one of O'Neill's two sons is a doctor, so I think he might've gotten some good advice  to stay away from the shot!",

Additionally, the government sought to withhold records and responses from Jean-Pierre.Judge Doughty on Tuesday broke the stalemate by ruling that both Fauci and Jean-Pierre must comply with the interrogatories and hand over the requested records.‚ÄúFirst,‚Äù Judge Doughty said in the ruling, ‚Äúthe requested information is obviously very relevant to Plaintiffs‚Äô claims. Dr. Fauci‚Äôs communications would be relevant to Plaintiffs‚Äô allegations in reference to alleged suppression of speech relating to the lab-leak theory of COVID-19‚Äôs origin, and to alleged suppression of speech about the efficiency of masks and COVID-19 lockdowns.
