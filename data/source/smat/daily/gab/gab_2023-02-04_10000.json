            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180¬∞ opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

Adams, it turns out, believes that the city's massive crime problem can be solved by going soft on criminals and instead placing the blame on alleged white racism.  He is not at all different from the cadre of black mayors who refuse to deal intelligently with the rising contempt for the rule of law that has plagued American cities since the riots of 2020.The argument put forth by these mayors is that we must reject the concept that everyone ought to be treated equally under the law.  Who could have predicted that, a mere half-century after the Civil Rights Movement, equality would be replaced with a new form of racism known as equity?What is equity?  The objective of equity is not equality of opportunity, but rather equality of outcome.  Everyone should have the same income, job success, house, neighborhood, etc.  In an equitable world, equal justice under the law is anathema.  The law must treat people differently based on their skin color.  \"Equity is based on the false premise of equal outcomes ‚Äî not equality of opportunity or equality under the law,\" writes Elizabeth Economou in a Fox opinion piece, \"whereby resources are seized from one group and given to marginalized or preferred groups.\"Equity means we must give minorities, especially blacks, special treatment in order to even up the scales and compensate for past injustices.  For equity to be reached, skin color must determine everything.  The right kind of skin color is black or brown.  White is the wrong color.Equity brings with it a dubious travel companion: Critical Race Theory.  CRT categorizes you as either oppressor or oppressed based on your race, sex, or sexual orientation.  Blacks are oppressed; whites are the oppressors.  To accept CRT, one must acknowledge the existence of systemic racism and white supremacy.  CRT is unapologetically racist and anti-white. Under CRT, it is open season on whites.  The campaign for equity has spawned an inquisition where white people are considered unrepentantly racist and should be required to atone for their sins.  One of the worst ideas ever invented by the Left, CRT wants to reintroduce racism and segregation to the forefront of American life.Under the guise of ending oppression of blacks, CRT would remake whites into the new underclass.  An example was provided courtesy of the City of Seattle, which inaugurated a training session for white city employees to \"undo their whiteness\" and affirm their \"complicity in racism.\"  Can you imagine if Seattle required all black employees to undo their blackness?
