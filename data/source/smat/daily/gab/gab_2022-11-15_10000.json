We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) used his Twitter account to call out parents who think they should have the right to know what their kids are learning in school, saying that it is “stupid” for parents to be in charge of their education. “Please tell me what I’m missing here. What are we doing next? Putting parents in charge of their surgeries? Clients in charge of their trials? When did we stop trusting experts? This is so stupid,\" Swalwell tweeted. The Democrat’s comments come following Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said “we are putting parents back in charge of their kids’ education,” on Tuesday night after winning re-election. What Swalwell failed to realize, is that patients may not be performing their surgeries, but they do still have a say in what doctors do to them.

          "content": "It was an open-and-shut case of “election interference.” The Biden administration, in an eleventh-hour effort to mobilize Gen Z voters to turn out for the Democratic Party pulled out its student loan “forgiveness” card. It worked.“Democrats would have gotten crushed without young voter support,” CNN notes. “Democratic House candidates won voters under the age of 45 by 13 points, while losing voters age 45 and older by 10 points.”But two days after Election Day was officially held after weeks of early voting in many states, the gut-kick came: The Biden student loan “forgiveness” was unconstitutional, after all. As the White House knew when it issued the order.On Thursday, the first legal blow came as a federal judge in Texas struck down President Biden’s student loan handout.“Biden’s plan, which aims to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients in college and up to $10,000 for others who borrowed using federal student loans,” Fox News reported.“Whether the Program constitutes good public policy is not the role of this Court to determine. Still, no one can plausibly deny that it is either one of the largest delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, or one of the largest exercises of legislative power without congressional authority in the history of the  United States,” United States District Judge Mark Pittman wrote.“In this country, we are not ruled by an all-powerful executive with a pen and a phone. Instead, we are ruled by a Constitution that provides for three distinct and independent branches of government… The Court is not blind to the current political division in our country. But it is fundamental to the survival of our Republic that the separation of powers as outlined in our Constitution be preserved. And having interpreted the HEROES Act, the Court holds that it does not provide ‘clear congressional authorization’ for the Program proposed by the Secretary,” Pittman added.The Biden administration appealed and the Constitution had not changed by Monday. The White House’s election gambit was again struck down — this time, by an Appeals court.“The panel, which comprised two Trump-appointed judges and one appointee of former President George W. Bush, said its order would remain in effect until further notice by the 8th Circuit or the Supreme Court,” the Hill reported.“The ruling was a win for six conservative-led states — Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina — which argued they were harmed by a freeze on the collection of student loan payments and interest,” the report added.“The court’s six-page ruling singled out the impact on a large, Missouri-based holder of student loans called the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri,” the Hill added.“The equities strongly favor an injunction considering the irreversible impact the Secretary’s debt forgiveness action would have as compared to the lack of harm an injunction would presently impose,” the panel wrote. “Among the considerations is the fact that collection of student loan payments as well as accrual of interest on student loans have both been suspended.”“The policy, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will cost about $400 billion over 30 years, has drawn numerous legal challenges,” the Hill added.Attorney and podcaster Eric Matheny added context on the decision.https://trendingpolitics.com/bidens-massive-case-of-election-interference-struck-down-by-federal-appeals-court-knab/?utm_source=DS21",

Giving 4 Trillion Dollars to the Radical Left for the Green New Deal, not Infrastructure, was an even bigger mistake.”“He blew the Midterms, and everyone despises him and his otherwise lovely wife, Coco Chow!” Trump added, referring to former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.Trump-endorsed tech entrepreneur Blake Masters lost to incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) in Arizona’s Senate race by more than 127,000 votes, or about 5.3 percent.The Democrats will have at least 50 seats, after Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) won reelection by defeating Republican challenger Adam Laxalt in Nevada’s Senate race. So far, only one Senate seat has flipped, with Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeating Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania’s Senate race. Fetterman will replace retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.).The Georgia Senate race remains undecided, with a runoff election scheduled for December after neither Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) nor Republican Herschel Walker secured more than 50 percent of the vote.The GOP is still in the position to retake control of the House. Republicans have 212 seats and Democrats have 201, according to data from Decision Desk, which The Epoch Times uses in its Election 2022 map. It requires 218 seats to take control of the lower chamber of Congress.In a separate Truth Social post earlier on Sunday, Trump shared an article titled “After Epic Failure, Growing Chorus Of Senators Signals It’s Time For McConnell To Go,” which argues that McConnell must be removed from the Senate Republican leadership.“Agree with this 100%!” Trump wrote, referring to the article. “Mitch McConnell is a disaster for the Republican Party and the Country.“He should have improved Infrastructure to fix it, not the Green New Deal, wrapped up like Infrastructure. He gave the Democrats 4 Trillion Dollars to throw out the window, and backed bad candidates like Lisa Murkowski,” Trump added.The Federalist article, published on Nov. 11, said McConnell “sabotaged Republicans in the 2022 midterms” by “pulling spending from competitive GOP candidates such as Blake Masters” and spending money against Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska.Trump-endorsed Tshibaka, a Republican who was a former Alaska Department of Administration Commissioner, has a 1.38-percent-lead (pdf) over incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). The winner has not been declared.Senate Republicans are reportedly scheduled to hold leadership elections on Nov. 16. However, some are calling for the vote to be delayed until after the Senate runoff election in Georgia is completed.“Think about it – if we hold leadership elections on Wednesday, there’d be more campaigning done in a high-school class president election than in the most deliberative body in the world,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) wrote on Twitter. “It is absurd. These elections need to be delayed.”“It makes no sense for Senate to have leadership elections before GA runoff,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter. “We don’t yet know whether we’ll have a majority &amp; Herschel Walker deserves a say in our leadership.“Critically, we need to hear a specific plan for the next 2 yrs from any candidate for leadership,” Cruz wrote.Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Senator-elect Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) have already said that Republicans need new Senate leadership. However, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told CBS News on Sunday that he will back McConnell as Senate GOP leader.A day before the midterms, Trump endorsed Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) as a “likely candidate” for Senate Republican leader in an interview with Fox News Digital. Trump praised Scott as a “very talented guy” who is “highly underrated.”The former president predicted Scott would “have a lot of support.”Sunday was not the first time Trump commented on the midterm elections. On Nov. 9, he conceded that election results were “somewhat disappointing” but still a “very big victory.”“While in certain ways yesterday’s election was somewhat disappointing, from my personal standpoint it was a very big victory—219 WINS and 16 Losses in the General—Who has ever done better than that?” Trump wrote.According to Ballotpedia, 17 Trump-backed Senate candidates, including Walker, won in the midterm elections, while 6 lost.https://www.theepochtimes.com/mcconnell-blew-the-midterms-says-trump-of-gop-election-losses_4861522.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",

Afghan soldiers surrendered the base with virtually no resistance, leaving U.S. intelligence officials with little ability to track suspected terrorists. The crisis at the southern border could prove an inviting target for terrorists, according to the DHS official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\"We’ve always been surprised by the countries of origin we see individuals coming from along our southwest border. It’s more than likely some Afghans will arrive now as well,\" the official told the Washington Free Beacon. \"It’s definitely a national security threat, and the strain of forces currently along the border would make it more likely that some would slip through illegally.\"The intelligence community warned the administration about terror threats at the southern border just weeks after President Joe Biden announced the planned withdrawal from Afghanistan. National security officials warned the White House in a classified memo, first reported by the Free Beacon, that border patrol officers had arrested two Yemeni nationals on the terrorist watch list as they attempted to cross into the United States from Mexico. One of the two men was also on the FBI’s no-fly list. Their names have not been released to the public.The Biden administration did not respond to a request for comment. https://thecommonsenseshow.com/agenda-21-conspiracy-immigration/calexit-joins-forces-cartels-terrorists-and-corrupt-democrats-overthrow-united-states?fbclid=IwAR1VueSk5oMx9cqq4YDFF3Qxadbme7o8BWzjllV67OWYLkwSOqriOobmgek The dots are beginning to connect to the Aztlan plan and the CALEXIT movement. At the heart of it is George Soros. However, many prominent members of the former Obama administration are participating as well as California's past and present governors. The goal is to remove California from the United States and collapse the economy. And they will do so by any means possible.The Most Dangerous Members of the CALEXIT MovementAccording to Paul Preston, reports are coming in that numerous state legislators from California, including \"California Senate pro tem Kevin De Leon, State representatives from Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Colorado have been meeting with members of La Raza, the Mexican government (consulate), Mexican Mafia (La California's violent Mexican gang Nortenos/Surenos/ Sur 13, La Familia and leaders of the Catholic/Jesuits church. They all have come up with a plan to separate California from the US.Former Governor Brown, his aides, and present Governor Newsome as well as the Bank of China have been in attendance in several of these meetings designed to sever California from the US. Further, The Common Sense Show has learned, independent of Paul Preston, that George Soros is bankrolling some of the costs associated with this movement. Former AG, Eric Holder, is the spokesperson.As Paul Preston has covered, Chapman University is spearheading the political goals of La Raza.",

And a whole bunch of slathering idiots thirsting after the secrets from the bottom who will never, ever know anything.<br />If this doesn't wake you up, nothing will.<br />You must listen to Bill Coopers Mystery Babylon series which this is part of that series.<br />This is the final parting of the curtain which reveals the biggest secret, the great work.<br />Now you know what the North American Union and the New World Order is all about.<br /><a href=\"https://www.thepostemail.com/2020/01/13/trumps-usmca-will-create-a-north-american-union-worse-than-the-european-union/?fbclid=IwAR1szTG2WDCZiZ6jv6vTkRHRrypFgKZtdXeOCsM6OeylMrSAHztpz3ncqro\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thepostemail.com/2020/01/13/trumps-usmca-will<span class=\"invisible\">-create-a-north-american-union-worse-than-the-european-union/?fbclid=IwAR1szTG2WDCZiZ6jv6vTkRHRrypFgKZtdXeOCsM6OeylMrSAHztpz3ncqro<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a> East German Stasi DHS Braces for Terror Threat on Southern Border National security officials fear newly freed Afghan terrorists may exploit border crisis<br />The Taliban's release of prisoners throughout Afghanistan poses a security threat on the U.S.-Mexico border, according to senior Department of Homeland Security officials and national security experts.<br />The Taliban freed thousands of prisoners, many of whom either worked directly with or had ties to FAKE al Qaeda and ISIS, when it captured Bagram Air Base on Aug. 15. Afghan soldiers surrendered the base with virtually no resistance, leaving U.S. intelligence officials with little ability to track suspected terrorists. The crisis at the southern border could prove an inviting target for terrorists, according to the DHS official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.<br />\"We’ve always been surprised by the countries of origin we see individuals coming from along our southwest border. It’s more than likely some Afghans will arrive now as well,\" the official told the Washington Free Beacon. \"It’s definitely a national security threat, and the strain of forces currently along the border would make it more likely that some would slip through illegally.\"<br />The intelligence community warned the administration about terror threats at the southern border just weeks after President Joe Biden announced the planned withdrawal from Afghanistan. National security officials warned the White House in a classified memo, first reported by the Free Beacon, that border patrol officers had arrested two Yemeni nationals on the terrorist watch list as they attempted to cross into the United States from Mexico. One of the two men was also on the FBI’s no-fly list. Their names have not been released to the public.<br />The Biden administration did not respond to a request for comment. <a href=\"https://thecommonsenseshow.com/agenda-21-conspiracy-immigration/calexit-joins-forces-cartels-terrorists-and-corrupt-democrats-overthrow-united-states?fbclid=IwAR1VueSk5oMx9cqq4YDFF3Qxadbme7o8BWzjllV67OWYLkwSOqriOobmgek\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>thecommonsenseshow.com/agenda-21-conspiracy-i<span class=\"invisible\">mmigration/calexit-joins-forces-cartels-terrorists-and-corrupt-democrats-overthrow-united-states?fbclid=IwAR1VueSk5oMx9cqq4YDFF3Qxadbme7o8BWzjllV67OWYLkwSOqriOobmgek<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a> The dots are beginning to connect to the Aztlan plan and the CALEXIT movement. At the heart of it is George Soros. However, many prominent members of the former Obama administration are participating as well as California's past and present governors. The goal is to remove California from the United States and collapse the economy. And they will do so by any means possible.<br />The Most Dangerous Members of the CALEXIT Movement<br /><br />According to Paul Preston, reports are coming in that numerous state legislators from California, including \"California Senate pro tem Kevin De Leon, State representatives from Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Colorado have been meeting with members of La Raza, the Mexican government (consulate), Mexican Mafia (La California's violent Mexican gang Nortenos/Surenos/ Sur 13, La Familia and leaders of the Catholic/Jesuits church. They all have come up with a plan to separate California from the US.<br /><br /><br /><br />Former Governor Brown, his aides, and present Governor Newsome as well as the Bank of China have been in attendance in several of these meetings designed to sever California from the US. Further, The Common Sense Show has learned, independent of Paul Preston, that George Soros is bankrolling some of the costs associated with this movement. Former AG, Eric Holder, is the spokesperson.<br /><br /><br /><br />As Paul Preston has covered, Chapman University is spearheading the political goals of La Raza.",
