            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Understanding legal precedents and how they interact, particularly on constitutional rights, can be tricky. That said, Biden is going where prior presidents have not – apparent disdain for rights. Examples illustrate. First, Biden’s federal mandate that employers over 100 enforce COVID vaccinations, absent a religious or health exemption, raises novel legal questions. To many, the mandate is infuriating. Enforced by OSHA, it will be litigated. What are the big issues? One is this: The Constitution’s 10th Amendment reserves all rights not expressly given to the federal government – to the American people and states. That is bound to be central.  The US Supreme Court has identified narrow federal powers under the “Supremacy Clause,” “Commerce Clause,” and 14th Amendment – with all others left to states and “the people.”Objectively, while “States rights” have eroded over time, “hard stops” do exist. This vaccine mandate may hit one or more of these “hard stops.” For reasons tied to Civil Rights and “equal protection,” federal powers are considerable. On the other hand, recent precedents make clear that states and “the people” have rights. Beyond free speech, freedom of worship, right to keep and bear arms, and enumerated freedoms, others exist. Major Supreme Court decisions point the way. For example, the 1997 Printz v. US decision “reaffirmed states’ rights and the Constitution’s anti-commandeering provisions.” Justice Scalia struck down the Brady Handgun Act – saying it violated the 10th Amendment. Why? It required local sheriffs to do background checks, “commandeering” law enforcement, telling them what to do – insisting they give up discretion. Scalia cited New York v. US (1992), which says the federal government can incentivize certain actions, not punish non-compliance.  That opinion, written by Reagan-appointee Sandra Day O’Connor, noted the federal government cannot “commandeer” or compel certain actions since doing so “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion.”  See, e.g., New York v. United States; and New York v. United States. Biden is pushing federal prosecution of parents speaking up at local school boards. This violates many norms, not least constitutional protections for free speech, federal-local control over school boards, and use of federal anti-terrorism laws, calling parents “domestic terrorists.” Again, this move contravenes well-established constitutional norms, pushing misuse of federal power (The Patriot Act), unprecedented coercion, intimidation, chilling of speech. States and parents are pushing back. See, e.g., The Patriot Act Wasn’t Meant to Target Parents; Eric Schmitt- Missouri Attorney General; OKLAHOMA PARENTS: SCHOOL-BOARD CRITICISM IS NOT ‘TERRORISM’; Opinion: Democrats have declared war on ‘school board moms’.",

The, ahem, “Biden Administration” is arguably the most Jewish administration in history. Is that mere happenstance? Nope. Statistically, it couldn’t be. It’s deliberate.True, the F.D. Roosevelt Administration was heavily Jewish, and ditto the Clinton Administration, but there are so many JEws in the “Biden Administration” that a list of them reads like the guest book at a NYC bar mitzvah. Is that a good thing? No. JEws are not genetically White, and they are famous for being political extremists. Hence the reason why America is not exactly running smoothly right now.Given the fact that JEws make up only 2% (two percent) of the global population, having 15 JEws in top positions of the Biden Administration is both shocking and suspicious [1].If Kamala Harris becomes president, her husband will be the first Jewish “First Gentleman” and the first “First Gentleman” (both).Mind you, this list of Jewish officials in the Biden Administration may not be complete:Merrick Garland, Attorney-GeneralAntony Blinken, Secretary of StateJanet Yellen, Secretary of the TreasuryAvril Haines, Director of National IntelligenceDavid Cohen, Deputy CIA DirectorAlejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland SecurityRochelle Walensky, Director, Center for Disease ControlRon Klain, Chief of StaffJeff Zients, COVID-19 CoordinatorRachel Levine, Deputy Secretary, Health and Human ServicesAnne Neuberger, Director of Cybersecurity, National Security AgencyWendy Sherman, Deputy Secretary of StateDouglas Emhoff, husband of Vice President Kamala HarrisJared Bernstein, member, Council of Economic AdvisorsEric Lander, Director, Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy ..

Part 1 of 2Rick BrunermerAs you go to vote next Tuesday, don’t be fooled by the left trying to tell you republicans are the party of violence.  That’s so absurd, it’s laughable.  I can’t believe anyone falls for it.  If you want my perspective, hear me out.Are you forgetting the violent, left-wing mobs of Antifa and BLM idiots pulling down statues all over America in 2020, during a summer of Hell, where these same groups were rioting in major cities, causing murders, dozens of police injured, billions of dollars of property damage, and I don’t recall one democrat saying anything against it.  In fact, I’ll never forget what Nancy Pelosi said: “People will do what they do.”Kamala Harris gleefully predicted that the protests, involving rioting and looting, wouldn’t end.  “They’re not going to stop.  They’re not going to stop.  This is a movement,  I’m telling you.  They’re not gonna stop.  And everyone beware because they’re not gonna stop.  They’re not gonna stop before Election Day and they’re not going to stop after Election Day.  And everyone should take note of that.

          "contentraw": "DO YOU REALLY WANT MORE OF THIS??  Part 1 of 2<br />Rick Brunermer<br /><br />As you go to vote next Tuesday, don’t be fooled by the left trying to tell you republicans are the party of violence.  That’s so absurd, it’s laughable.  I can’t believe anyone falls for it.  If you want my perspective, hear me out.<br /><br />Are you forgetting the violent, left-wing mobs of Antifa and BLM idiots pulling down statues all over America in 2020, during a summer of Hell, where these same groups were rioting in major cities, causing murders, dozens of police injured, billions of dollars of property damage, and I don’t recall one democrat saying anything against it.  In fact, I’ll never forget what Nancy Pelosi said: “People will do what they do.”<br /><br />Kamala Harris gleefully predicted that the protests, involving rioting and looting, wouldn’t end.  “They’re not going to stop.  They’re not going to stop.  This is a movement,  I’m telling you.  They’re not gonna stop.  And everyone beware because they’re not gonna stop.  They’re not gonna stop before Election Day and they’re not going to stop after Election Day.  And everyone should take note of that.
