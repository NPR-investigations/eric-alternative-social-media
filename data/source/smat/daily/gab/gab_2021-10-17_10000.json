Better yet, he wrote a song against it. How disappointing for the BiG Pharma Mafia Cabal-Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J and others that such revered public figure in the rock music industry is now tuned against them. After all, when you turn on the rock stations in your local town, they all have Pfizer &amp; Moderna paying their bills with ad campaigns designed for sucker rock fans to take their poison shot. How dare this Clapton speak out against them? NBC which is part of the Cabal establishment media now is ordered by their masters to write a hit piece how Clapton \"destroyed his career\". Who do you want to believe? Or better yet ask yourself: am I a \"vaccine sucker\"? Do I have the ability to do my own critical thinking or am I a rock 'n roll sheeple? Your move. Or like the clown in Saw movie used to say: \"your choice\"",

Weinstein goes on to say that \"every single rabbi he knows says that they don't actually believe in the Jewish God of the old testament. How can this be if Judaism is a religion?\"Rabbi Wolpe replies by explicitly stating that \"Judaism is NOT a religion.\"He says Christianity is a religion because ....\"If tomorrow I believe in Jesus, I'm Christian. If the day after I don't, I'm not. But If a Jew stops believing in the Jewish religious beliefs, he is still Jewish.\" So what are the Jewish people? Now Rabbi Wolpe has to talk in code, because it's politically forbidden to admit that Jews are a race. Rabbi Wolpe says \"I would use the word \"tribe\" but \"tribe\" has negative connotations\". So he does believe they are a \"tribe\", but he can't say that because it's politically incorrect.Ultimately Rabbi Wolpe says that the Jewish people are a \"religious family\". Of course, scientifically speaking, a racial group is basically a large extended family group.Eric Weinstein goes on to say that ....\"Judaism is effectively a breeding protocol....There's a very strange moment when you sign up for '23 and Me'...and you get a DNA test result that tells you how Jewish you are\"(at 12 min) https://youtu.be/3mSxiFUzZ-Q?t=718",

However there is an exception – when the circumstances constitute a riot and if the officer using the chemical incapacitant reasonably believes its use is necessary to stop and prevent more destructive behavior.<\/p><p>&quot;The law clearly allows Portland Police to use effective tools necessary to control violent crowds; however, activist attorneys are deliberately misinterpreting legislation to prevent police from intervening,&quot; House GOP Minority Leader Christine Drazan said Friday. &quot;They have no business putting law enforcement and community safety at risk.&quot;<\/p><p>Portland Police Sgt. Kevin Allen said the new law is forcing law enforcement to balk at squelching potential lawlessness because of &quot;potential implications.&quot;<\/p><p>&quot;Until we have some clarity on the bill, we have to follow the most restrictive interpretation of it,&quot; Allen said.<\/p><p>The Portland protests are still ongoing from the 2020 George Floyd social injustice unrest waged by activist groups like antifa and Black Lives Matter.<\/p>"

For the Prophetic Path is open for all those of faith to approach the King of kings.Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”We see that the patriarchs of old prophesied for the benefit of our entering the Holy City. They gave us a Path for faith to walk in. The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us. As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way. This is the testimony they will bear for Me.1Kings 6:32 “The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.”Exodus 23:20-22 “ Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.” -- [end of excerpt]🌱Blessed are they who have their names written on the door of the Lord for these have entered into His marvellous Light and are filled by grace daily partaking of the meat of the altar.1Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:#S8W #godscall #covenant #assembly #sunday #churchonline",

For the Prophetic Path is open for all those of faith to approach the King of kings.Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”We see that the patriarchs of old prophesied for the benefit of our entering the Holy City. They gave us a Path for faith to walk in. The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us. As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way. This is the testimony they will bear for Me.1Kings 6:32 “The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.”Exodus 23:20-22 “ Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.” -- [end of excerpt]🌱Blessed are they who have their names written on the door of the Lord for these have entered into His marvellous Light and are filled by grace daily partaking of the meat of the altar.1Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:#S8W #godscall #covenant #assembly #sunday #churchonline",

For the Prophetic Path is open for all those of faith to approach the King of kings.Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”We see that the patriarchs of old prophesied for the benefit of our entering the Holy City. They gave us a Path for faith to walk in. The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us. As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way. This is the testimony they will bear for Me.1Kings 6:32 “The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.”Exodus 23:20-22 “ Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.” -- [end of excerpt]🌱Blessed are they who have their names written on the door of the Lord for these have entered into His marvellous Light and are filled by grace daily partaking of the meat of the altar.1Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:#S8W #godscall #covenant #assembly #sunday #churchonline",

For the Prophetic Path is open for all those of faith to approach the King of kings.Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”We see that the patriarchs of old prophesied for the benefit of our entering the Holy City. They gave us a Path for faith to walk in. The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us. As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way. This is the testimony they will bear for Me.1Kings 6:32 “The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.”Exodus 23:20-22 “ Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.” -- [end of excerpt]🌱Blessed are they who have their names written on the door of the Lord for these have entered into His marvellous Light and are filled by grace daily partaking of the meat of the altar.1Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:#S8W #godscall #covenant #assembly #sunday #churchonline",

The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us.

For the Prophetic Path is open for all those of faith to approach the King of kings.Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”We see that the patriarchs of old prophesied for the benefit of our entering the Holy City. They gave us a Path for faith to walk in. The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us. As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way. This is the testimony they will bear for Me.1Kings 6:32 “The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.”Exodus 23:20-22 “ Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.” -- [end of excerpt]🌱Blessed are they who have their names written on the door of the Lord for these have entered into His marvellous Light and are filled by grace daily partaking of the meat of the altar.1Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:#S8W #godscall #covenant #assembly #sunday #churchonline",

Every one of you is a member of it. Furthermore, God has set-up in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle-workers, healers, assistants, administrators, and those who speak in tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles or have the gift of healing? Do all speak in tongues, all have the gift of interpretation of tongues? Set your hearts on the greater gifts.\n1 Cor. 13:1-13 \nNow I will show you the way which surpasses all the others. If I speak with human tongues and Angelic as well, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal, if I have the gift of Prophecy and, with full knowledge, comprehend all Mysteries, if I have faith great enough to move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give everything I have to feed the poor and hand over my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient; love is kind. Love is not jealous, it does not put on airs, it is not snobbish. Love is never rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not prone to anger; neither does it brood over injuries. Love does not rejoice in what is wrong but rejoices with the truth. There is no limit to Love's forbearance, to its trust, it's hope, its power to endure. Love Never Fails. Prophecies will cease, tongues will be silent, knowledge will pass away. Our knowledge is imperfect and our prophesying is imperfect. When the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. When I was a child I used to talk like a child, think like a child, reason like a child. When I became a man I put childish ways aside. Now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. My knowledge is imperfect now; then I shall know even as I am known. There are in the end three things that last: faith, hope, and love, and the greatest of these is love.",

As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way.

For the Prophetic Path is open for all those of faith to approach the King of kings.Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”We see that the patriarchs of old prophesied for the benefit of our entering the Holy City. They gave us a Path for faith to walk in. The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us. As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way. This is the testimony they will bear for Me.1Kings 6:32 “The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.”Exodus 23:20-22 “ Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.” -- [end of excerpt]🌱Blessed are they who have their names written on the door of the Lord for these have entered into His marvellous Light and are filled by grace daily partaking of the meat of the altar.1Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:#S8W #godscall #covenant #assembly #sunday #churchonline",

For the Prophetic Path is open for all those of faith to approach the King of kings.Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”We see that the patriarchs of old prophesied for the benefit of our entering the Holy City. They gave us a Path for faith to walk in. The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us. As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way. This is the testimony they will bear for Me.1Kings 6:32 “The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.”Exodus 23:20-22 “ Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.” -- [end of excerpt]🌱Blessed are they who have their names written on the door of the Lord for these have entered into His marvellous Light and are filled by grace daily partaking of the meat of the altar.1Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:#S8W #godscall #covenant #assembly #sunday #churchonline",

For the Prophetic Path is open for all those of faith to approach the King of kings.Revelation 22:12 “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”We see that the patriarchs of old prophesied for the benefit of our entering the Holy City. They gave us a Path for faith to walk in. The sons of Jacob gave us the Stewardship and the priesthood in Judah and Levi, and they were a sign for the faith of the people which was put in the design of the doors of the temple.Their names are inscribed on the Doors of the Holy City. The angels are the living tether of His grace for our entrance, just as the cherubim were portrayed on the doors of the temple.Revelation 21:12 “And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:”We see that the Doors of the temple of Solomon were of olive tree, for no man can enter without His Spirit, and the angels bear His name for us. As the Lord God said to Moses, “Beware of him.”Why beware of the angel? Because he will give you My words as the steward of My house to speak to the people, and they will WALK in My ways or this Prophetic Path. All the prophets will confirm this new way. This is the testimony they will bear for Me.1Kings 6:32 “The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.”Exodus 23:20-22 “ Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.” -- [end of excerpt]🌱Blessed are they who have their names written on the door of the Lord for these have entered into His marvellous Light and are filled by grace daily partaking of the meat of the altar.1Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:#S8W #godscall #covenant #assembly #sunday #churchonline",

Officials from the two organizations say they will share their findings with law enforcement and policymakers.<br /><br />“All of us, including in the private sector, have a critical role to play in fighting the spread of extremism and hate.
