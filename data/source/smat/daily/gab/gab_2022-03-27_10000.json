            "description": "As the American public continues to have their attention focused on the situation in Ukraine and the corporate media's propaganda that Russia is a threat to our way of life, because they are ready to launch cyber attacks and nuclear bombs at us, the REAL destruction of America continues on from within at break-neck speed. On Thursday this past week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who began his press conference by saying \"we're going to focus on the science\" and then proceeded to do just the opposite, issued an executive order that exempted professional sports players and the entertainment industry from having to comply with COVID-19 vaccine mandates. If you are a NYC sports fan, I am sure that you welcomed this news, as now you can attend games with your fellow Billionaire Wall Street executives who fund these teams, and watch your team put their best players on the field or court for a change, along with your fellow New York residents such as Albert Bourla, Jamine Dimon, Larry Fink, and many others who probably got tired of the COVID protocols preventing them from enjoying their entertainment and then handed Mayor Eric Adams a memo outlining his executive order. The New York City professional sports franchises and entertainment industry are now considered essential services who do not have to comply with COVID mandates. If, on the other hand, you are employed by the U.S. Government on a military salary, you are considered expendable, even if you are among the elite members of our nation's Special Forces. In yet another decision by our \"Conservative\" U.S. Supreme Court who continues to rule as if there is actually a killer virus that has been raging as a \"pandemic\" for going on 3 years now that the public has to be protected from, the Court ruled 6-3 against Navy Seals being entitled to a religious exemption for COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and their right to defend their country.",

I really don‚Äôt want to be out there outguessing the mayor, who I‚Äôm sure is trying to do what‚Äôs best for the city,‚Äù Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said on Fox News.<\/p><p>New York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, on Thursday announced that all private and city workers must continue providing proof of COVID-19 vaccination but that athletes and performers are exempt from the requirements.<\/p><p>‚ÄúHe made that decision to pull back on the requirement for vaccination for certain entertainers and sports figures and some of the athletic teams. There is a pushback on that, that that might be unfair to others. But I‚Äôm not there on the ground in New York. I don‚Äôt have a good feel for what the situation is. So, it really is a tough problem,‚Äù said Fauci, a native New Yorker who has headed the Maryland-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.<\/p><p>Adams said the exemption was the result of balancing safety and a need to drive business to concert and sports venues.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/new-york-exempting-athletes-from-vaccine-mandate-might-be-unfair-fauci_4363702.html?utm_source=CCPVirusNewsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2022-03-27\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theepochtimes.com/new-york-exempting-athletes<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">-from-vaccine-mandate-might-be-unfair-fauci_4363702.html?utm_source=CCPVirusNewsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2022-03-27<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><\/p>"

In the Pacific Northwest, Friedrich ran sleazy and illegal operations, the White Horse Restaurant and Inn, and the New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia. His business interests catered to the \"deprived\", and shared space with opium dens and brothels. There were rumors that authorities were getting ready to crack down on his type of dens of prostitution, drug dealing and ill-repute. They say that Friedrich was always one step ahead of the law. Around May 1901, Friedrich cashed out and headed back to Germany with his money.Reportedly, Friedrich Drumpf returned to Kallstadt, Germany and married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ. In the meanwhile, Friedrich changed his surname to \"Trump\" to hide his past, and shroud his true background. \"Drumpf\" may be a variation of \"Trumpf\". In 1869, Friedrich had an estate worth $500,000 in today‚Äôs dollars when he died in Queens on May 30th 1918, at age 49.There were comments that Elizabeth Christ (born 10/10/1880) was really the daughter of Christ Christ and Anna Maria Rathon.

The name of Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf, was anglicized to Frederick Trump, but he died several years before the report.Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich Drumpf was born on March 14th 1869, in Kallstadt, Pfalz, Germany. In the Pacific Northwest, Friedrich ran sleazy and illegal operations, the White Horse Restaurant and Inn, and the New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia. His business interests catered to the \"deprived\", and shared space with opium dens and brothels. There were rumors that authorities were getting ready to crack down on his type of dens of prostitution, drug dealing and ill-repute. They say that Friedrich was always one step ahead of the law. Around May 1901, Friedrich cashed out and headed back to Germany with his money.Reportedly, Friedrich Drumpf returned to Kallstadt, Germany and married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ. In the meanwhile, Friedrich changed his surname to \"Trump\" to hide his past, and shroud his true background. \"Drumpf\" may be a variation of \"Trumpf\". In 1869, Friedrich had an estate worth $500,000 in today‚Äôs dollars when he died in Queens on May 30th 1918, at age 49.There were comments that Elizabeth Christ (born 10/10/1880) was really the daughter of Christ Christ and Anna Maria Rathon. Christ Christ was Friedrich's uncle, his father's brother. Friedrich Trump married his first cousin, Elizabeth Christ. Therefore, the Trumps are also a family which is engaged in the bloodline games as well.Donald Trump's great-grandparents, Christian Johannes Trump and Katharina Barbara Kober Trump, \"Kober\" is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname. Some people suggest the name isn't \"Kober\", but \"Kolber\". \"Kolber\" is very often Jewish. We have seen the genealogies being whitewashed this way again and again.

WIVB News Channel 4 in Buffalo reported Friday that State Supreme Court Justice Donald Cerio ruled the emails, obtained during a raid of Pigeon's home in 2015, were obtained improperly. ‚ÄúWe respectfully disagree with the court‚Äôs decision regarding this technical issue and will soon determine how to best move this important prosecution forward. We appreciate the court stating that our office has proceeded in good faith at all times on this matter,‚Äù Amy Spitalnick, a spokesperson for the AG‚Äôs office, told WIVB in response to the judge's ruling.According to WIVB, Spitalnick noted that judge‚Äôs ruling did not pertain to how the AG‚Äôs office executed the subpoena, but how it took Google to actually send them the information.Pigeon pleaded not guilty last year to multiple corruption charges filed in an indictment announced by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The 55-year-old political consultant was charged with bribery in the second degree, a class C felony; bribery in the third degree, a class D felony; grand larceny theft by extortion in the third degree, a class D Felony; and six counts of rewarding official misconduct in the second degree, a class E felony. The case involves Pigeon's alleged dealings with State Supreme Court Justice John A. Michalek. The 65-year-old Michalek resigned from the bench after pleading guilty to various charges in what Schneiderman's office has described as a scheme that involved receiving bribes from Pigeon, and for filing a false document with the New York State Office of Court Administration when he appointed a receiver who had been suggested by Pigeon. Michalek admitted guilt to a pair of felonies, including bribe receiving in the third degree and offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree. In addition to entering the plea, Michalek submitted a letter of resignation to the chief administrative judge.Earlier this year, Pigeon appeared in federal court after the FBI unsealed a complaint alleging that he conspired to solicit a campaign contribution to the campaign of Gov. Andrew Cuomo from an internet gambling firm in Montreal that had contributed $388,000 in lobbying fees to one of Pigeon's companies between 2010 and 2015. The federal complaint pointed to emails seized from Pigeon's condominium in Buffalo during the 2015 raid as evidence that he conspired to hide the true source of the foreign contribution\"",
