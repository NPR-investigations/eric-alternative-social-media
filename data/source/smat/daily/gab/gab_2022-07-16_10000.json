They don’t have the resources because they were defunded after George Floyd Mania, and they don’t want to be accused of racism after George Floyd Mania.That doesn’t seem like something that is going to change. The current Mayor of New York, Eric Adams, ran on being tough on crime, and then he didn’t do anything at all related to that issue. Things have just continued to get worse under him.So, I don’t really think anyone cares if black gang members kill each other. That’s fine. The solution is to give them shooting lessons, so they stop hitting random people who are just standing around.We need to get dem niggas educated.https://stormer-daily.rw/queens-mother-with-young-children-shot-in-drive-by-shooting/",

He faces two misdemeanor contempt of Congress charges for doing exactly what Obama AG Eric Holder did (with zero consequences) - ignore a Congressional subpoena, according to Politico.Of course, Holder was held in contempt for concealing documents related to the \"fast & furious\" scandal, which was tied to the death of an estimated 150 Mexican civilians - while Navarro is refusing to answer House Democrats' questions surrounding the 2020 election and the January 6th riot.\"It is curious...at a minimum why the government treated Mr. Navarro’s arrest in the way it did,\" US District Court Judge Amit Mehta said during a Friday hearing on Navarro's case. \"It is a federal crime, but it is not a violent crime.\"Mehta, a former federal defender, said it was puzzling that prosecutors didn’t just tell Navarro he was going to be charged and allow him to walk into an FBI office, as some white-collar defendants are permitted to do.“It is a surprise to me that self-surrender was not offered,” the judge said. However, he proposed no particular response and did not demand any explanation from prosecutors. -PoliticoThe FBI has accused Navarro of making \"numerous false statements\" about his arrest, and said that his first request to use the phone that day was for a lawyer - rather, a TV producer about a scheduled interview. One of his lawyers, John Rowley, suggested that the FBI's treatment suggested \"animus\" toward Navarro, considering that two other Trump White House aides who similarly ignored subpoenas - Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino - were not charged (much less arrested at an airport).https://www.zerohedge.com/political/judge-questions-fbis-aggressive-arrest-former-trump-official-peter-navarro",
