I've known him since forever, and we've had ups and downs,\" Richards said. \"This COVID thing, it's split people up and made people sometimes go awry for a while, you know?\"Clapton has been an outspoken critic of vaccines and vaccine mandates, criticizing the United Kingdom's lockdown measures in a series of songs written with Van Morrison. He also collaborated with Italian vaccine skeptic Robin Monotti on his solo single \"Heart of a Child,\" which he released in December.Although Clapton insists he isn't an anti-vaxxer, he said he has been \"ostracized\" by friends, family and fellow musicians due to his controversial opinions and songs. He also vowed to not to play at venues that required proof of vaccination on his fall 2021 tour, though he ultimately reneged on that promise.\"I just want to get rid of this damn thing, and the only way I can see us doing it is everybody does as the doctor says,\" Richards added. \"I don't understand quite why some people are getting so wound up about it. You wouldn't get wound up about the flu or something, you know what I mean? And that's even worse. And I'm no doctor, but hey, this thing works in various nasty ways on people, and we all have to bear with each other. We all have to have a little sympathy.\"Elsewhere, Richards said he received a note from Paul McCartney after the former Beatle described the Stones as a \"blues cover band,\" which led to some good-natured ribbing between both artists. \"Paul and I know each other pretty well, and when I first read it, I said, 'There's been a lot of deleting and editing going on here,'\" Richards said. \"And the next day I got a message from Paul saying, 'If you've read this shit, it's all out of context, believe me, boys.'\"",

Liz Cheney who is one of two Republicans appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve on the panel. Cheney, the Post reported, is “spending the majority of her time on the matter, people familiar with her work say,” instead of reclaiming her lost role on the Natural Resources Committee.“Their challenge: Making the public care deeply — and read hundreds of pages more — about an event that happened more than a year ago, and that many Americans feel they already understand,” the Post highlighted, followed by the passage below (emphasis ours):They’ll attempt to do so this spring through public hearings, along with a potential interim report and a final report that will be published ahead of the November midterms — with the findings likely a key part of the Democrat’s midterm strategy.They hope their recommendations to prevent another insurrection will be adopted, but also that their work will repel voters from Republicans who they say helped propel the attack.For me, this fascist, banana republic witch hunt is very disturbing.This confirms my call for the deconstruction of the federal government as it is like a sick head, beyond the ability to be healed, leaving the enter body (nation) to die a slow death, right in front of our eyes.Unfortunately, I don’t see much unity in the GOP which means that any degree of voter fraud by the democratic party, in the 2022 midterms, could end up making Tuesday, November 8, 2022, a day that America may never recover from.I pray that a massive number of concerned Americans will actually stop watching Netflix for an hour or two and get out and vote for “Liberty’s” sake.By: Eric Thompson, editor of Eric Thompson Show.

January 6th Sham Investigation Motive Revealed Eric Thompson March 21, 2022  SHARENotice: This article may contain commentary that reflects the author's opinion.As most Americans have moved on from the Democratic party’s fake news, such as the Russian Hoax, 2 failed impeachments of former President Trump & Trump’s tax returns, the fall out from the January 6th riots appears to be the Democrats, last hurrah, still hoping to stop the GOP from taking back the U.S. Congress in November. With Biden’s poll numbers in the tank and with Americans upset at the inflation rate, fuel costs, the southern invasion, and the administration’s mishandling of the COVID vaccine mandates, the left will not get a bump in support from the sitting President, instead, they will have to try to win in spite of him.According to a Washington Post article this week, the January 6th sham committee is all about one thing, the upcoming midterm elections.The Federalist is reporting:Democrats Admit Jan. 6 Committee Is All About MidtermsHouse Democrats prosecuting political dissidents in the form of the Select Committee on Jan. 6 admitted this week the show trial investigation is all about the November midterms.On Friday, The Washington Post chronicled the committee’s next steps in a feature headlined “Jan. 6 committee faces a thorny challenge: Persuading the public to care” as Americans lose enthusiasm for severe retribution against those involved with a constitutionally protected rally 14 months ago, who are the true target of the committee’s work as opposed to perpetrators of the Capitol riot.",

Don Young after his death last week at age 88.Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she was open to running for the House seat that belonged to the late Republican Rep. Don Young, who died Friday at the age of 88. Palin was asked about her political future during an appearance with Eric Bolling on Newsmax Monday.  'Oh my goodness, think of those huge shoes that are to be filled when we consider Don Young's longevity and his passion, his love, his fighting spirit for our wonderful state of Alaska, and for the nation as a whole,' she began. 'If I were asked to serve in the House and take his place, I would be humbled and honored and I would in a heartbeat, I would.' 'We'll see how that process is going to go in terms of filling that seat,' she continued. 'But that would be an honor.' Bolling chuckled and said he would love to see the ex-governor and former vice presidential candidate in Congressional hearings with the 'left' and asked if she was up for the challenge. 'Well, you know, when you have nothing to lose,' Palin answered.'When the media has already clobbered you, as bad as you can get clobbered, and the haters, you're not going to change their mind,' she said. 'But you have faith that there are enough Americans who understand where you're coming from, your love for the country, your service heart,' the ex-governor added. Palin again said she has 'nothing to lose - as is the case today.'And she suggested her family was likely on board. 'I think it would be good for my family even,' she said. 'Yeah, I'd serve,' she told Bolling again.",

(But) because of their lack of education or purposeful destruction of so many sectors of the economy – they certainly look to blame somebody else,” she told Newsmax TV’s Bolling on his show, \"The Balance.”<br /><br />Gas prices reached an all-time national average high of $4.33 last Monday, according to AAA, and hit $5 a gallon in California, Nevada and Hawaii.<br /><br />The average price for a regular gallon of gas is $4.25, 72 cents more than a month ago and $1.37 higher than this time last year.<br /><br />California leads the nation at nearly $5.85 per gallon.<br /><br />The national average could hit $5-$6 per gallon all summer, Scott Shelton, an energy specialist at commodity investment broker ICAP, told Fortune, \"with diesel prices even higher.\"<br /><br />Palin said the White House wants to distract, “as usual.”<br /><br />“I think it’s comical,” she added.<br /><br />“Americans do not believe at all when (White House press secretary) Jen Psaki and the president try to point the finger at another world leader for the economic problems we’re having because of their policies shutting down our own development of the God-given resources we have untapped in America.”<br /><a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/whitehouse-putin-gas-russia/2022/03/21/id/1062246/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>newsmax.com/newsfront/whitehouse-putin-gas-ru<span class=\"invisible\">ssia/2022/03/21/id/1062246/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />※※<br />CHINA COMRADES WITHIN<br /><a href=\"/tags/Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/POLITICAL_FakeNEWS\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#POLITICAL_FakeNEWS<\/a><br /><a href=\"/tags/MAGA_PATRIOTS\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#MAGA_PATRIOTS<\/a> SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by Precinct<br />JOIN The Precinct Project<br /><a href=\"https://precinctstrategy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>precinctstrategy.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Join your local GOP, take it over, &amp; register new voter",

After thorough review, I find no evidence to support either claim even if I support the overall goal,” he wrote, noting that the measure “leaves too many unanswered questions.”Opponents of the transgender sports bill argued it was a bigoted response to a problem that doesn’t exist, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana saying it planned a lawsuit against what it called “hateful legislation.”March 22, 2022Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb has vetoed a bill that would bar transgender athletes from competing in girls school sports across the state.In a veto letter on Monday, Holcomb, a Republican, said that he feels the legislation “falls short” ” of providing clarity and a consistent state policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports” in Indiana.The “presumption of the policy laid out in HEA 1041 is that there is an existing problem in K-12 sports in Indiana that requires further state government intervention,” wrote Holcomb, who signaled support for the bill last month.Republican sponsors of the bill said it was needed to protect the integrity of female sports and opportunities for girls to gain college athletic scholarship.Holcomb said the “wide-open nature” of the grievance provisions in HEA 1041 that apply to all K-12 schools in the state “makes it unclear about how consistency and fairness will be maintained for parents and students across different counties and school districts.”The governor noted that this concern was also raised by the Indiana High School Athletic Association, a non-governmental entity.“Student-athletes could be treated differently according to which school they attend and compete for,” Holcomb wrote. “Frustration of students, parents and administrators will likely follow. This of course only increases the likelihood of litigation against our schools with the courts having to adjudicate the uncertainties.”Holcomb also noted that in several states that have passed similar legislation, lawsuits have been filed, or have threatened to be filed.The Indiana law would prohibit K-12 students who were born male but who identify as female from participating in a sport or on an athletic team that is designated for women or girls. But it wouldn’t prevent students who identify as female or transgender men from playing on men’s sports teams.https://www.theepochtimes.com/indiana-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-transgender-athletes-from-girls-sports_4353304.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=gp※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA #POLITICAL_FakeNEWS#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",

But it wouldn’t prevent students who identify as female or transgender men from playing on men’s sports teams.<br /><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/indiana-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-transgender-athletes-from-girls-sports_4353304.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=gp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theepochtimes.com/indiana-governor-vetoes-bil<span class=\"invisible\">l-banning-transgender-athletes-from-girls-sports_4353304.html?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_campaign=gp<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />※※<br />CHINA COMRADES WITHIN<br /><a href=\"/tags/Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/POLITICAL_FakeNEWS\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#POLITICAL_FakeNEWS<\/a><br /><a href=\"/tags/MAGA_PATRIOTS\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#MAGA_PATRIOTS<\/a> SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by Precinct<br />JOIN The Precinct Project<br /><a href=\"https://precinctstrategy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>precinctstrategy.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Join your local GOP, take it over, &amp; register new voter",

Eric Holcomb has vetoed a bill that would bar transgender athletes from competing in girls school sports across the state.In a veto letter on Monday, Holcomb, a Republican, said that he feels the legislation “falls short” ” of providing clarity and a consistent state policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports” in Indiana.The “presumption of the policy laid out in HEA 1041 is that there is an existing problem in K-12 sports in Indiana that requires further state government intervention,” wrote Holcomb, who signaled support for the bill last month.Republican sponsors of the bill said it was needed to protect the integrity of female sports and opportunities for girls to gain college athletic scholarship.Holcomb said the “wide-open nature” of the grievance provisions in HEA 1041 that apply to all K-12 schools in the state “makes it unclear about how consistency and fairness will be maintained for parents and students across different counties and school districts.”The governor noted that this concern was also raised by the Indiana High School Athletic Association, a non-governmental entity.“Student-athletes could be treated differently according to which school they attend and compete for,” Holcomb wrote. “Frustration of students, parents and administrators will likely follow. This of course only increases the likelihood of litigation against our schools with the courts having to adjudicate the uncertainties.”Holcomb also noted that in several states that have passed similar legislation, lawsuits have been filed, or have threatened to be filed.The Indiana law would prohibit K-12 students who were born male but who identify as female from participating in a sport or on an athletic team that is designated for women or girls. But it wouldn’t prevent students who identify as female or transgender men from playing on men’s sports teams.https://www.theepochtimes.com/indiana-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-transgender-athletes-from-girls-sports_4353304.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=gp※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA #POLITICAL_FakeNEWS#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",

After thorough review, I find no evidence to support either claim even if I support the overall goal,” he wrote, noting that the measure “leaves too many unanswered questions.”Opponents of the transgender sports bill argued it was a bigoted response to a problem that doesn’t exist, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana saying it planned a lawsuit against what it called “hateful legislation.”March 22, 2022Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb has vetoed a bill that would bar transgender athletes from competing in girls school sports across the state.In a veto letter on Monday, Holcomb, a Republican, said that he feels the legislation “falls short” ” of providing clarity and a consistent state policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports” in Indiana.The “presumption of the policy laid out in HEA 1041 is that there is an existing problem in K-12 sports in Indiana that requires further state government intervention,” wrote Holcomb, who signaled support for the bill last month.Republican sponsors of the bill said it was needed to protect the integrity of female sports and opportunities for girls to gain college athletic scholarship.Holcomb said the “wide-open nature” of the grievance provisions in HEA 1041 that apply to all K-12 schools in the state “makes it unclear about how consistency and fairness will be maintained for parents and students across different counties and school districts.”The governor noted that this concern was also raised by the Indiana High School Athletic Association, a non-governmental entity.“Student-athletes could be treated differently according to which school they attend and compete for,” Holcomb wrote. “Frustration of students, parents and administrators will likely follow. This of course only increases the likelihood of litigation against our schools with the courts having to adjudicate the uncertainties.”Holcomb also noted that in several states that have passed similar legislation, lawsuits have been filed, or have threatened to be filed.The Indiana law would prohibit K-12 students who were born male but who identify as female from participating in a sport or on an athletic team that is designated for women or girls. But it wouldn’t prevent students who identify as female or transgender men from playing on men’s sports teams.https://www.theepochtimes.com/indiana-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-transgender-athletes-from-girls-sports_4353304.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=gp※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA #POLITICAL_FakeNEWS#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",

Eric Holcomb has vetoed a bill that would bar transgender athletes from competing in girls school sports across the state.In a veto letter on Monday, Holcomb, a Republican, said that he feels the legislation “falls short” ” of providing clarity and a consistent state policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports” in Indiana.The “presumption of the policy laid out in HEA 1041 is that there is an existing problem in K-12 sports in Indiana that requires further state government intervention,” wrote Holcomb, who signaled support for the bill last month.Republican sponsors of the bill said it was needed to protect the integrity of female sports and opportunities for girls to gain college athletic scholarship.Holcomb said the “wide-open nature” of the grievance provisions in HEA 1041 that apply to all K-12 schools in the state “makes it unclear about how consistency and fairness will be maintained for parents and students across different counties and school districts.”The governor noted that this concern was also raised by the Indiana High School Athletic Association, a non-governmental entity.“Student-athletes could be treated differently according to which school they attend and compete for,” Holcomb wrote. “Frustration of students, parents and administrators will likely follow. This of course only increases the likelihood of litigation against our schools with the courts having to adjudicate the uncertainties.”Holcomb also noted that in several states that have passed similar legislation, lawsuits have been filed, or have threatened to be filed.The Indiana law would prohibit K-12 students who were born male but who identify as female from participating in a sport or on an athletic team that is designated for women or girls. But it wouldn’t prevent students who identify as female or transgender men from playing on men’s sports teams.https://www.theepochtimes.com/indiana-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-transgender-athletes-from-girls-sports_4353304.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=gp※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA #POLITICAL_FakeNEWS#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",

Bien sûr, il s’agit d’un problème allemand particulier, qui est dû à notre histoire malheureuse. Mais ce serait bien avec moi si nous n’avions plus ce problème spécial. »En principe, le juge Hassemer a déclaré qu’il n’était « pas un partisan de telles lois qui font des opinions erronées une infraction punissable ».Et, en octobre 2008, un groupe d’éminents historiens européens réunis en France a publié ce qui est devenu connu sous le nom d’Appel de Blois, s’opposant également aux lois qui cherchaient à réglementer et à criminaliser la mémoire historique.Le texte de l’appel, dont les signataires comprenaient deux des historiens juifs les plus célèbres du monde, Eric Hobsbawm et Carlo Ginzburg, se lisait comme suit : « Soucieux de la moralisation rétrospective de l’histoire et de la censure intellectuelle, nous appelons à la mobilisation des historiens européens et à la sagesse des politiciens.http://www.heritageanddestiny.com[L’administration des preuves est le principe de base qui permet l’exercice de la justice dans un Etat de droit digne de ce nom.
