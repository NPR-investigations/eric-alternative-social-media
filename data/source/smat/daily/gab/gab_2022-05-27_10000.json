A caucus is \"a closed meeting of a group of persons belonging to the same political party or faction usually to select candidates or to decide on policy;\" also, \"a group of people united to promote an agreed-upon cause.\" Creating TRUMP caucuses would by-pass the legalities, expense and time needed to create a third party. It would be the fastest, most effective (since it would penetrate all parties) and least expensive way to compete against and defeat the traitorous Rinos of the Republican Party and the treasonous Democrats of the Democratic Party, which together comprise that diabolical conglomerate known as the Socially Woke American Marxist Party (SWAMP). Those who voted for Trump (Trumpers) can register with the political party of their choice, but to join these caucuses and become a card-carrying TRUMPer, they would need to fill out yet another registration form and agree to whatever the TRUMP platform is. By uniting people, talents and resources under one newly-created, common, political banner (TRUMP), both money and people will be siphoned off of the SWAMP---thus draining it---which would, in particular, completely gut and financially destroy the SWAMP Rinos. Once established as local, state and national TRUMPs, each TRUMP would have ELECTION INTEGRITY as its first and most important party platform principle, for without election integrity, all voting is in vain. (As a platform principle, TRUMPers would NOT vote in areas where there is no election integrity.) In every area where election integrity is established, TRUMP candidates would be put on the ballot. If any TRUMP really wants to effect radical and rapid change, then in every area where there is no election integrity it could establish the \"no taxation without representation\" principle as part of its platform and promote and support TAX REVOLTS until election integrity has been established. These and all other platform principles would be decided by the TRUMPers themselves, as they organize themselves around America First Trumpism, defining it as they see fit. If this is something you'd like to see happen, freely join this group and help to organize caucus committees throughout the land and establish this as, essentially, a 70 to 100 million strong third party that the governing elite will have to deal with.",

Looking into things like that? We can stop that that way. But yet they wanna just continue to talk about taking away your constitutional rights.”The Republican Senate candidate didn’t provide any additional details on the scope of this proposed social media monitoring agency, how it would work, or how it could potentially prevent mass shootings.Walker is one of several politicians to call for increased social media in the wake of a mass shooting.
