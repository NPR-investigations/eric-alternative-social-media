Recognizing a potential niche, left wing activists created ERIC to clean voter rolls their way, using their rules. So in 2012 the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) was formed as a membership organization primarily for blue States.

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT<\/p><br /><hr><br /><p>PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:<br />Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):<\/p><ol><li>Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.<br /><\/li><li>Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don&#39;t respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don&#39;t post it. <br />***<br />It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God&#39;s heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else&#39;s well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:<br /><\/li><li>Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.<br /><\/li><li>Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts<br /><\/li><li>Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)<br /><\/li><li>Posts that don&#39;t meet the criteria mentioned above<br /><\/li><li>Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.<br /><\/li><li>Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)<br /><\/li><li>All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.<br />***<br />Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.<br />***<br />“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV<br /><\/li><\/ol>",

The states are accusing high-ranking officials, including President Joe Biden, of having “pressured and colluded” with social media companies to censor and suppress information on a number of big stories over the past two years.Among the officials named as defendants are White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and the President’s Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci. They, and others, are accused of exerting undue pressure on, or working together, with a number of Big Tech companies such as Meta, Twitter and YouTube to suppress information regarding the Hunter Biden laptop controversy, the origins of Covid-19, and security concerns associated with mail-in voting during the pandemic.Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry claim the Biden Administration has been doing so “under the guise of combating misinformation.”The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, describes the  administration’s supposed efforts to hush up certain information as “one of its greatest assaults by federal government officials in the Nation's history” on Americans’ constitutional right to free speech.The filing goes on to claim that “Having threatened and cajoled social-media platforms for years to censor viewpoints and speakers disfavored by the Left, senior government officials in the Executive Branch have moved into a phase of open collusion with social-media companies to suppress disfavored speakers, viewpoints, and content on social-media platforms under the Orwellian guise of halting so-called ‘disinformation,’ ‘misinformation,’ and ‘malinformation’.”In an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt explained the decision to file the lawsuit by saying that he would “not stand idly by while the Biden Administration attempts to trample on the First Amendment rights of Missourians and Americans.”His colleague from the state of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, went so far as to characterize Big Tech as an “extension of Biden’s Big Government,” which is busy “suppressing truth and demonizing those who think differently.” Landry compared Joe Biden to Joseph Stalin over the president’s policies that allegedly aim to “censor free speech and propagandize the masses.” The Attorney General said the lawsuit was seeking to “ensure the rule of law and prevent the government from unconstitutional banning, chilling, and stifling of speech.”",

I wanted to select someone outside USA so maybe the French Eric Zemmour who was a famous TV presenter and lately candidate for the French presidency. Jayda Fransen is the head of the far-right party British Freedom Party in Britain.What amazes me in these people is their ability to behave by deceit in the same way without having really a central comandment. This reminds me of the movie that I always refer to of John Carpenter \"They Live\" who shows the Jews as an Alien race wearing a kind of magical watches with wich they can communicate to organize against Humans or the Goyim.There are many other famous and influential people on the social media and Alternative media, even on the mainstream media. It is impossible that they don't know about the Jewish role in everything, but they intentionally hide it. I can in most cases support the work of these people on the average sleeping Goy who is starting to wake up or just feeling the smell of conspiracies in mainstream narrative. We need such right-wingers who don't talk about Jews to make the beginners cross the gate. They will sooner or later discover the full truth.Probably the most important is not to forget the Jewishness of these people especially when they steer us against other secondary or fake enemies. Take the example of many anti-Muslim right-Wingers in Europe like Eric Zemmour who never mentions that his people are those who bring the Muslims to France. Such people might have a role later to misguide and also to use the Nationalist feeling of ethno-Europeans in order to use them in clashes or political pressure in the democratic game.We are probably very trapped in a mental Gulag and the attacks of Jewry is intensifying day after day. They are closing Channels not only on Youtube, but also on Bitchute and Odysee while distracting us with racial clashes with the millions of people they have been bringing since the last 3-4 decades.What about your country, your city? Who is trending now as a \"right wing\" Jewish activist / politician?Btw Stefan Molineux of Canada is a great example, and sure the famous Alex Jones who believes in all conspiracies and tells us \"the Nazis are coming\". I think he is right, we are coming, not an army but as common people in homes and companies from everywhere, even the grandma and grandpa. Those evil \"Nazis\".",
