Moore’s position differs even from that of the guy tipped to be the next head of the SBC, the Rev. Albert Mohler, who voted for Trump in 2020 and said–even after the events at the Capitol–that he’d do it again.“It’s–it’s been lonely,” says Moore of his stance. “But I think many people have experienced that sort of loneliness over the past four or five years. I don’t know a single family that’s not been divided over President Trump, and politics generally. I don’t know a single church that hasn’t been.” Moore’s opinions are not new. He has been a Never Trumper since at least 2015 and scoffs at the notion put forward by many evangelical leaders that Trump converted to Christianity just before being elected. “It is not a position that I find rational,” he says. “Especially when Mr. Trump has been very clear about his own spiritual journey, or lack thereof.”",

He takes out a gas mask from one of his little luggage[s]. He opened one of his gas tanks, and he said, 'Oops, my bad'. He pulls out an ax, he drops it, he takes a gun out, he starts shooting.'",

At the time, violent riots had begun breaking out all across the country after the accidental death of George Floyd, a black man who died of a fentanyl overdose while in police custody in Minneapolis.Riots took place in Washington D.C., including in Lafayette Square just north of the White House, with numerous instances of damage to private businesses and assaults against civilians, as well as the destruction and vandalism of many historic monuments. On the night of May 31st, rioters attempted to burn down the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church, located in the square, where almost every sitting President of the United States has gone at least once, often for Inauguration Day ceremonies. Although rioters initially blocked emergency vehicles from trying to reach the scene,…Despite numerous allegations in the mainstream media and from Democratic officials claiming that the rioters were peaceful and had been violently removed using tear gas, a watchdog report confirmed that this was not the case. Nevertheless, the far-left American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed multiple lawsuits on behalf of Black Lives Matter D.C. and 13 of the rioters.The DOJ announced that “the plaintiffs, Black Lives Matter D.C. and individuals who attended the protests, agreed to dismiss their claims for equitable relief against the United States.” The DOJ statement added that the United States Park Police and the Secret Service have “agreed to update and clarify their policies governing demonstrations, and to implement the policy changes within 30 days of today’s settlement.”",

At the PIT-404 facility, NATO officers are blocked. The tunnels are equipped with a bunker system with armor protection.    >There are about 240 foreigners inside, including officers of NATO and the French Foreign Legion, as well as biolab staff. Their security, funded by Akhmetov, has up to 3,000 people.    >The biolab under the Azovstal plant in Mariupol at the so-called PIT-404 facility was built and operated by Metabiota, a company associated with Hunter Biden, Rinat Akhmetov and Vladimir Zelensky.    >In the laboratories of this facility, tests were conducted to create bioweapons. Thousands of Mariupol residents have become “guinea pigs” in these terrible trials. And mostly Western “specialists” took part in these inhuman experiments.    >Some French intelligence officers died during the rescue operation. The head of French intelligence, Eric Vido, was dismissed on March 31, 2022 for the failures of French intelligence in the war in Ukraine.    >Officers from the USA, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Sweden, Poland and Greece are now blocked in the dungeons of Azovstal.

Three former Feinstein staffers made similar claims.<br /><br />None of them agreed to be identified, but the story comes after two years of chatter on Capitol Hill about Feinstein’s mental capacity to do her job.<br /><br />After the Chronicle posted the story, Feinstein, 88, said in a statement that “the real question is whether I’m still an effective representative for 40 million Californians, and the record shows that I am.”<br /><br />While she said she focused much of the last year on husband Richard Blum’s illness and death, “I have remained committed to achieving results, and I’d put my record up against anyone’s.\"<br /><br />The statement said that Feinstein (D-Calif.) led the reauthorization of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act, “secured more direct government funding for my state than any other Democratic senator other than the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and secured additional funding to retain federal firefighters to help California prepare for the upcoming wildfire season.”<br /><br />Feinstein is almost always trailed by staffers while walking around the Capitol, and staffers frequently interject on her behalf when the senator gets questions from reporters.<br /><br />When asked recently about the troubled nomination of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to be ambassador to India, she declined to comment, saying she wasn’t up to speed on the details.<br /><br />On the day of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recall election in September, she declined to answer any questions about what it may mean about her own political future. Some Democrats speculated that Feinstein would face pressure to step down if a Republican had beaten Newsom. During the conversation in a Senate hallway, she then asked an aide whether the election was that day.<br /><br />The Senate has no age cap, and it has occasionally wrestled with questions about whether some of its aging members were able to do the job.<br /><br />Many senators, while privately acknowledging Feinstein's memory lapses, have been reluctant to publicly comment on the situation, in deference to her groundbreaking political career.<br /><br />Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) issued on-the-record statements to the Chronicle defending Feinstein.<br /><br />CONTINUE READING&gt;&gt;<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/feinstein-defends-herself-amid-questions-223549349.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>yahoo.com/news/feinstein-defends-herself-amid<span class=\"invisible\">-questions-223549349.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Soon after that report emerged, thousands of people scouring James’ social-media presence made a truly shocking (if unsurprising) discovery: the suspect who shot at least 10 people in a terrifying and meticulously planned mass shooting (police found explosive devices that didn’t detonate) has been publishing bizarre, hate-filled rants on YouTube praising other mass shooters terrorists and calling on people to kill “whitey”.Amazingly, YouTube hasn’t yet taken down the page, which – as far as we can tell – still includes all of the hateful videos that media outlets have reported on extensively overnight.In one video, James verbally attacked NYC Mayor Adams, saying he had been through the city’s mental health system due to a “mental health” issue that had gotten him “locked up”. In the system, he said, he experienced a kind of violence that would make someone “go and get a gun and shoot motherfuckers.”In his videos, he appears to express support for an extreme “black nationalist” ideology. At certain points, he even expresses a hatred or dislike for black people, referring to them as racial slurs which we won’t repeat here (although you can find some examples over at the Daily Beast).At one point, James calls upon “black Jesus” to “kill all the whiteys”.“O black Jesus, please kill all the whiteys”Frank James, the person of interest in the #Brooklyn mass shooting, posted a photograph of the Dallas #BLM shooter who killed 5 cops.
