The speakers are excellent and the topic very exciting. After listening, I of course, wanted to try TA-65. But I practically gasped when I went to the website and calculated that a year's supply would cost between $6200-$7200 for a twice daily protocol. It appears that TA-65 is a supplement for the rich. For something with so much potential, why can't it be made more affordable so that many others could avail themselves of the product?Eric McDonaldBob Samuels, appreciate your comments about the Telomere Summit. Just to clarify dosage and pricing. Most patients on TA65 take one capsule or tablet per day. Depending on what you are looking to target, i.e. telomerase activation or biomarkers of the immune system our most recent study of 500 patients saw statistically significant improvement with our 100unit capsules which retail for $100/month.

          "content": "28 Jan 2022, LA, California — #Shipping backlogs at American ports continued, and spread, even as Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg declared victory earlier this month, with import volumes dropping at West Coast ports — and beyond.\"Buttigieg traveled to the Los Angeles & Long Beach #port facilities on Jan. 11, celebrating what the Biden administration claimed 'was heroic progress' in addressing #supplychain problems. Outgoing L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti proclaimed that Buttigieg had “saved Christmas” because stores were able to stock shelves — without noting ongoing #shortages throughout the country, and the fact that prices of available #goods, including toys, had risen dramatically.The administration’s main argument was that by threatening fines on companies that left inbound #containers on the docks, they were able to induce companies to clear space. So-called “aging #cargo” has been reduced by 62% at the L.A. & Long Beach ports.But those spaces “have been replaced with empty containers waiting for shipment back to Asia,” the Wall Street Journal noted on Tuesday. COVID19 & employee exhaustion have also hurt the effort to offload containers — and backups have now begun to spread to ports on the East Coast & the Gulf of Mexico.Combined inbound volume fell about 14% at the ports of LA & Long Beach in December compared with a year ago, according to preliminary data from the ports. It was the fourth straight month of year-over-year declines.That was even as the backlog of container ships off the coast of Southern California kept growing. The queue of vessels waiting to enter the port complex rose past 100 during December, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California & reached a record 109 ships in early January.John McCown, a shipping industry veteran .. said import volumes at Gulf & East Coast ports rose during the second half of this year as West Coast volumes declined, suggesting a shift to less congested parts of the country. Now, container ships are starting to back up at those ports too.The Biden admin has tried for months to reduce #backlogs, especially at LA & Long Beach which together handle about 40% of U.S. container imports.

          "contentraw": "28 Jan 2022, LA, California — <a href=\"/tags/Shipping\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Shipping<\/a> backlogs at American ports continued, and spread, even as Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg declared victory earlier this month, with import volumes dropping at West Coast ports — and beyond.<br /><br />\"Buttigieg traveled to the Los Angeles &amp; Long Beach <a href=\"/tags/port\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#port<\/a> facilities on Jan. 11, celebrating what the Biden administration claimed 'was heroic progress' in addressing <a href=\"/tags/supplychain\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#supplychain<\/a> problems. Outgoing L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti proclaimed that Buttigieg had “saved Christmas” because stores were able to stock shelves — without noting ongoing <a href=\"/tags/shortages\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#shortages<\/a> throughout the country, and the fact that prices of available <a href=\"/tags/goods\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#goods<\/a>, including toys, had risen dramatically.<br /><br />The administration’s main argument was that by threatening fines on companies that left inbound <a href=\"/tags/containers\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#containers<\/a> on the docks, they were able to induce companies to clear space. So-called “aging <a href=\"/tags/cargo\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#cargo<\/a>” has been reduced by 62% at the L.A. &amp; Long Beach ports.<br /><br />But those spaces “have been replaced with empty containers waiting for shipment back to Asia,” the Wall Street Journal noted on Tuesday. COVID19 &amp; employee exhaustion have also hurt the effort to offload containers — and backups have now begun to spread to ports on the East Coast &amp; the Gulf of Mexico.<br /><br />Combined inbound volume fell about 14% at the ports of LA &amp; Long Beach in December compared with a year ago, according to preliminary data from the ports. It was the fourth straight month of year-over-year declines.<br /><br />That was even as the backlog of container ships off the coast of Southern California kept growing. The queue of vessels waiting to enter the port complex rose past 100 during December, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California &amp; reached a record 109 ships in early January.<br /><br />John McCown, a shipping industry veteran .. said import volumes at Gulf &amp; East Coast ports rose during the second half of this year as West Coast volumes declined, suggesting a shift to less congested parts of the country.

Stan apunta pero la criatura realiza otro disparo, el disparo golpea su cabeza pero la bala rebota, Stan dispara varias veces, las balas golpean los bordes de la ventana y finalmente una alcanza al objetivo impactando en su hombro.<br /><br />*Booom* Una serie de explosiones dstruyen el area de la casa alrededor de la ventana y finalmente la Criatura muere cuando su cuerpo explota también desde su interior.<br /><br />Stan respira profunda y lentamente y entonces fija su mirada en el cadaver, ve con pesar como su sangre se derrama en el suelo, no hay nada que hacer al respecto. <br /><br />*Tick-tic-tick-tock* Stan escucha una piedra rodar por las tejas del tejado de una de las casas cercanas a él entonces la piedrita cae al suelo, Stan reacciona rapidamente y apunta con su arma alto para ver si había algo en el techo, sus ojos se abren un poco más y empieza a bajar el arma lentamente, hay una figura sobre el tejado y sostiene con su brazo una vara de metal un poco gruesa y con un mango en un extremo. \"¿Tommy?\" La luz de la luna detras de él pero Stan esta seguro de lo que ve.<br /><br />*Steps* *Steps* *Steps* Stan mira a su alrededor lentamente escuchando pasos sobre los techos de las casas y el como crujen las tejas bajo sus pies, su rostro confuso e inseguro observa como aunque distanciados en realidad forman algo parecido a un circulo desde lo alto de estas casas pero los reconoce, por alla puede ver a Fang, a Eric, a Angelica y-<br /><br />*Stomp* El sonido hace que Stan centre su atención en lo que tiene en frente, es Tommy que ha saltado desde el techo y ha aterrizado en el suelo frente a él  arrrodillado, se pone de pie y ahora puede verlo mejor, su piel es color verde y sus ojos brillan en la misma manera que los otros monstruos, hay un número en su mano que en lugar de brillar parece marcado en la piel de su mano un grupo de venas resaltadas van en dirección de este número y es \"1\". *Siinnnnnnn* Stan da un paso hacía atras al escuchar la punta de taladro del arma de Tommy es igual a la original... quiza es la original.",
