            "description": "Would you have stood up against slavery in the 1860s? Or against Nazi Germany in the 1930s? What about your pastor? It seems the Church today is more interested in being politically correct than speaking out in defense of the truth. But can it really be God&#39;s will that His children be silent at a time like this? Best-selling author (Bonhoeffer, Luther, Amazing Grace, Miracles) and radio host Eric Metaxas joins Frank to reveal highlights of his new book, Letter to the American Church, where he summons the Church to battle and calls for pastors (and other Christians) to be courageous enough to speak up against the massive anti-Christian forces that now threaten to permanently transform American society. In this podcast episode, Frank and Eric bring to light four major errors we make in thinking that Christians should NOT be involved in politics or other controversial issues:  \tA misunderstanding of the word FAITH.  \tThe idol of evangelism.  \tThere is no command &#34;Don&#39;t be political!&#34;  \tAvoiding sin is not the central purpose of the Christian life.   They also discuss the spiral of silence, religious liberty, and the haunting similarities between today’s American Church and the German Church of the 1930s. We hope you&#39;ll share both this podcast episode and Eric&#39;s book with your pastor and church congregation!

Truth be told, if we reversed engineered where these supposed white separatists are, it would go back to an original IP address to the Pentagon, FBI, CIA. We all know this. They all work in tandem now to destroy America. Most of us know if WS exists, they are a small handful, loners and kooks and probably less than a thousand in the entire U.S. They know this too. So why are they spending the money? They are spending the money as a psyop to label YOU an enemy of the state, a terrorist, someone that does not fit the mustard of red flag laws and someone to be incarcerated and all assets confiscated. Who are the originators of these red flag laws? Who are voting for them? These are the ones compromised by China and the WEF, etc. This is no less than cult membership and a Worldwide religion where the elites wield the worlds. They are just creating paperwork as a groundwork to invade suburbs of America, get our guns and put us in jail or kill us. Why are they rounding up Patriot leaders? Why are they charging them with bogus crimes and putting them in jail? Why are they putting dissidents like Dr. Gold and the J6 in jail and not allowing them fair process and trials? Who do we know in history does this to their people before rounding up of those that have been vilified by the government in control? Communists, Nazis, that's who and people controlled by immoral acts against humanity. God haters.Why do you think that I have to block about 3 posers of WS a day on Gab? It's because these are operatives that are working to frame Gab as a WS website. Sounds extreme, but if you don't believe it, it still hasn't hit you that we have been overtaken by a hostile international power controlled by the communists and we are no longer \"America\" home of the free. We know that the elections were internationally interfered with. IP addresses with changed votes go to many countries: Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France, Saudi Arabia, England, Netherlands, Pakistan, Iran, Australia, Canada. etc. Some of these were supposed allies. Not anymore. We don't have allies and if we do, they still cannot be trusted as yet. The hostile government which has been controlled internationally and within every branch and letter agency, right down to state, county and precinct levels are over-run with not slanty eyed Chinese operatives, but people like Mitch McConnel, Eric Swalwell, Diane Feinstein, Soros controlled DAs, the teachers' unions, Big Tech, Big Corporations, Big Banks, CDC, WHO, American Medical Association, American Pediatric Association, State Hospitals and Learning agencies, Colleges, churches, non-profit organization, all Media outlets save a few, News agencies that are on-line, Newspapers etc., etc, etc. When you look at Feinstein, don't think of her little cab driver as The Spy. She was The Spy and her cabby was her controller. Same with Zuckerberg and his wife. Same with McConnel and others. The Governors of states have been compromised. Take Texas. There was a spy ring found here from China, but we heard little to nothing about it, only that the Chinese were allowed to set fire to the documents when taking the office down. Former CIA head and Secretary of State under Trump has told us the Governers of states are compromised and we know who they are. (Kemp comes to mind \"Bigly\" as Trump would say.) Can we trust Pompeo? We couldn't trust Mad Dog or most of those Trump had around him.We are living in a planned deconstruction of America. America no longer exists. You, as a true red blooded American and Patriot are an enigma to them. You are their enemy, and they will stop at nothing to finish their plan to control every part of your life or kill you. Pray, pray, pray...although we have been told that this chess game is finished, and the good guys win...they are not conceding and are taking the path of scorched earth.",
