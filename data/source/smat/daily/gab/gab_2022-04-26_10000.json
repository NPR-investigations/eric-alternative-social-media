The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Kacsmaryk’s ruling more than once, determining the administration also violated federal immigration law.<br /><br />The MPP, enacted in 2019, applies “to aliens who have no legal entitlement to enter the United States but who depart from a third country and transit through Mexico to reach the United States land border.” It requires those seeking to enter the U.S. to remain in Mexico while their immigration applications are considered, which can take years.<br /><br />In addition to leading increased criminal activity, Biden's border policies are draining resources, Paxton said.<br /><br />“JOE Biden could immediately remedy the influx of crime pouring across our border by reinstating the Migrant Protection Protocols,” Paxton argued when he filed the lawsuit. “Dangerous criminals are taking advantage of the lapse in law enforcement and it’s resulting in human trafficking, smuggling, a plethora of violent crimes, and a massive, unprecedented burden on state and federal programs for which taxpayers must foot the bill. We cannot allow this lawlessness to destroy our communities any longer.”<br /><a href=\"https://americasvoice.news/justthenews/us-supreme-court-hear-arguments-lawsuit-seeking-reinstatement-remain/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>americasvoice.news/justthenews/us-supreme-cou<span class=\"invisible\">rt-hear-arguments-lawsuit-seeking-reinstatement-remain/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />※※<br />CHINA COMRADES WITHIN<br /><a href=\"/tags/Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA<\/a><br /><a href=\"/tags/MAGA_PATRIOTS\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#MAGA_PATRIOTS<\/a> SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by Precinct<br />JOIN The Precinct Project<br /><a href=\"https://precinctstrategy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>precinctstrategy.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

The actions of the leftist lunatics and their reaction has been a wake up call to many and even if Musk's actions lead to evil (implanting microchips into people, current researching on animals) would you rather still have the leftist lunatics in control of twitter and interfering in the 2022 election as they did during 2020?The bible is clear where we are headed - although until the end of the end times and Jesus return, we are to occupy until then which means defending our freedoms until God says time is up.  I was banned from twitter in 2019 because in response to her whining about why millennials were not having kids, I responded I was glad leftist morons were not breeding and would eventually die off (that was before covid and the kill shots killing them off) I was also banned from facebook by questioning if the invader children biden was shipping to NY were to be used in medical research  (like fauci was guilty of previously) or were being trafficked.  I was banned on youtube for posting Eric Ciaramella on a FOX news live broadcast during the first Trump fake impeachment hearing.

The actions of the leftist lunatics and their reaction has been a wake up call to many and even if Musk's actions lead to evil (implanting microchips into people, current researching on animals) would you rather still have the leftist lunatics in control of twitter and interfering in the 2022 election as they did during 2020?<br /><br />The bible is clear where we are headed - although until the end of the end times and Jesus return, we are to occupy until then which means defending our freedoms until God says time is up.  I was banned from twitter in 2019 because in response to her whining about why millennials were not having kids, I responded I was glad leftist morons were not breeding and would eventually die off (that was before covid and the kill shots killing them off)<br /><br /> I was also banned from facebook by questioning if the invader children biden was shipping to NY were to be used in medical research  (like fauci was guilty of previously) or were being trafficked.  I was banned on youtube for posting Eric Ciaramella on a FOX news live broadcast during the first Trump fake impeachment hearing.   I'm glad to see someone standing up to protect the rights of Americans especially since the worthless republicans have not done so.<br /><br />Why didn't Trump stop the media propaganda when he was in office?  obama made it legal for the fake news media to claim their propaganda fiction is news and Trump did not reverse it all the while calling the MSM 'fake news'.",

For example, at one point Greg Phillips, who the documentary describes as having “a deep background in election intelligence,” says:“We identified in Atlanta 242 mules that went to an average of 24 drop boxes. In Philadelphia alone, we’ve identified more than 1,100 mules.”At another point, Phillips, after being asked by Dinesh what proof they have of their massive claims, says that True the Vote collected and used “four million minutes of surveillance video around the country” to determine what happened during the election.But what Trump played was just a taste, a tantalizing hint, of what the full documentary could reveal. if that’s what they put in the trailer, just imagine what’s yet to come in the full thing!Breitbart, reporting on when the full release will happen, notes that:Upcoming on May 4, Trump will host a premiere at his luxurious Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago in south Florida. Also, on May 7, there will be a virtual premiere where up to a quarter million can purchase tickets to watch across the country.

For this fiscal year, the first six months has officially recorded over a million apprehensions. And these are just the apprehensions that we're acknowledging,'' Logan said on ''Eric Bolling: The Balance.\" ''Effectively, right now we have no southern border.''Logan said the numbers do not include the thousands of ''got-aways,'' migrants that crossed the border illegally and were not apprehended, or the migrants who were turned back after trying to come across.She said this is all before the coming end to Title 42 in May, the public health law that allowed immigrants to be sent back to their countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The Department of Homeland Security said March 30 that it is preparing a strategy to deal with an increasing number of migrants coming across the border illegally once Title 42 ends on May 23.The agency said its new strategies would include ''acquiring and deploying resources to address increased volumes, delivering a more efficient and fair immigration process, processing and removing those who do not have valid claims, and working with other countries in the Western Hemisphere to manage migration and address root causes.''''Violence, food insecurity, poverty, and lack of economic opportunity in several countries in the Western Hemisphere are driving unprecedented levels of migration to our Southwest Border,'' the agency said announcing the new measures.''The devastating economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the region has only exacerbated these challenges. Human smuggling organizations peddle misinformation that the border is open. DHS is implementing a comprehensive strategy to address a potential increase in the number of border encounters.''Logan said that even the earlier administration of Barack Obama, where Biden served as vice president, acknowledged a crisis at the southern border, terminology that is now noticeably absent in remarks from JOE BIDEN REGIME''Even during Obama, we would hear about the crisis on the border,'' she said. ''At no point has JOE BIDEN ever acknowledged this as a crisis. They have the policy they want. They have the results that they want and actually, the language that they're using is the language of the United Nations. It's the language of the global elite.''https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/logan-border-immigration-biden/2022/04/25/id/1067196/※※CHINA COMRADES WITHIN#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA#MAGA_PATRIOTS SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by PrecinctJOIN The Precinct Projecthttps://precinctstrategy.com/Join your local GOP, take it over, & register new voter",

And these are just the apprehensions that we're acknowledging,'' Logan said on ''Eric Bolling: The Balance.\" ''Effectively, right now we have no southern border.''<br /><br />Logan said the numbers do not include the thousands of ''got-aways,'' migrants that crossed the border illegally and were not apprehended, or the migrants who were turned back after trying to come across.<br /><br />She said this is all before the coming end to Title 42 in May, the public health law that allowed immigrants to be sent back to their countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security said March 30 that it is preparing a strategy to deal with an increasing number of migrants coming across the border illegally once Title 42 ends on May 23.<br /><br />The agency said its new strategies would include ''acquiring and deploying resources to address increased volumes, delivering a more efficient and fair immigration process, processing and removing those who do not have valid claims, and working with other countries in the Western Hemisphere to manage migration and address root causes.''<br /><br />''Violence, food insecurity, poverty, and lack of economic opportunity in several countries in the Western Hemisphere are driving unprecedented levels of migration to our Southwest Border,'' the agency said announcing the new measures.<br /><br />''The devastating economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the region has only exacerbated these challenges. Human smuggling organizations peddle misinformation that the border is open. DHS is implementing a comprehensive strategy to address a potential increase in the number of border encounters.''<br /><br />Logan said that even the earlier administration of Barack Obama, where Biden served as vice president, acknowledged a crisis at the southern border, terminology that is now noticeably absent in remarks from JOE BIDEN REGIME<br /><br />''Even during Obama, we would hear about the crisis on the border,'' she said. ''At no point has JOE BIDEN ever acknowledged this as a crisis. They have the policy they want. They have the results that they want and actually, the language that they're using is the language of the United Nations. It's the language of the global elite.''<br /><a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/logan-border-immigration-biden/2022/04/25/id/1067196/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/logan-border-immigrati<span class=\"invisible\">on-biden/2022/04/25/id/1067196/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />※※<br />CHINA COMRADES WITHIN<br /><a href=\"/tags/Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Militant_WING_BLM_ANTIFA<\/a><br /><a href=\"/tags/MAGA_PATRIOTS\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#MAGA_PATRIOTS<\/a> SHOULD Take back GOP Precinct by Precinct<br />JOIN The Precinct Project<br /><a href=\"https://precinctstrategy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>precinctstrategy.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />Join your local GOP, take it over, &amp; register new voter",

The name of Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf, was anglicized to Frederick Trump, but he died several years before the report.Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich Drumpf was born on March 14th 1869, in Kallstadt, Pfalz, Germany. In the Pacific Northwest, Friedrich ran sleazy and illegal operations, the White Horse Restaurant and Inn, and the New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia. His business interests catered to the \"deprived\", and shared space with opium dens and brothels. There were rumors that authorities were getting ready to crack down on his type of dens of prostitution, drug dealing and ill-repute. They say that Friedrich was always one step ahead of the law. Around May 1901, Friedrich cashed out and headed back to Germany with his money.Reportedly, Friedrich Drumpf returned to Kallstadt, Germany and married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ. In the meanwhile, Friedrich changed his surname to \"Trump\" to hide his past, and shroud his true background. \"Drumpf\" may be a variation of \"Trumpf\". In 1869, Friedrich had an estate worth $500,000 in today’s dollars when he died in Queens on May 30th 1918, at age 49.There were comments that Elizabeth Christ (born 10/10/1880) was really the daughter of Christ Christ and Anna Maria Rathon. Christ Christ was Friedrich's uncle, his father's brother. Friedrich Trump married his first cousin, Elizabeth Christ. Therefore, the Trumps are also a family which is engaged in the bloodline games as well.Donald Trump's great-grandparents, Christian Johannes Trump and Katharina Barbara Kober Trump, \"Kober\" is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname. Some people suggest the name isn't \"Kober\", but \"Kolber\". \"Kolber\" is very often Jewish. We have seen the genealogies being whitewashed this way again and again. Changing one letter is often the best way to do it.Donald Trump's parents were Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. His grandparents were Friedrich Trump and Elizabeth Christ. Donald Trump has five children from three marriages: Donald John Trump Jr., Ivanka Marie Trump, and Eric Frederick Trump with Ivana Marie Trump; Tiffany Ariana Trump with Marla Ann Maples; and Barron Trump with Melania Knauss Trump.The Trump family has the largest number of Jews in the first family. All three married children of Donald Trump being married to Jews. That is no mere coincidence, it's a cohencidence. Four Generations of the Trumps beginning from Friedrich Trump (or Drumpf) have had close business and personal associations with Jews.",

The name of Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf, was anglicized to Frederick Trump, but he died several years before the report.Donald Trump's grandfather Friedrich Drumpf was born on March 14th 1869, in Kallstadt, Pfalz, Germany. In the Pacific Northwest, Friedrich ran sleazy and illegal operations, the White Horse Restaurant and Inn, and the New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia. His business interests catered to the \"deprived\", and shared space with opium dens and brothels. There were rumors that authorities were getting ready to crack down on his type of dens of prostitution, drug dealing and ill-repute. They say that Friedrich was always one step ahead of the law. Around May 1901, Friedrich cashed out and headed back to Germany with his money.Reportedly, Friedrich Drumpf returned to Kallstadt, Germany and married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ. In the meanwhile, Friedrich changed his surname to \"Trump\" to hide his past, and shroud his true background. \"Drumpf\" may be a variation of \"Trumpf\". In 1869, Friedrich had an estate worth $500,000 in today’s dollars when he died in Queens on May 30th 1918, at age 49.There were comments that Elizabeth Christ (born 10/10/1880) was really the daughter of Christ Christ and Anna Maria Rathon. Christ Christ was Friedrich's uncle, his father's brother. Friedrich Trump married his first cousin, Elizabeth Christ. Therefore, the Trumps are also a family which is engaged in the bloodline games as well.Donald Trump's great-grandparents, Christian Johannes Trump and Katharina Barbara Kober Trump, \"Kober\" is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname. Some people suggest the name isn't \"Kober\", but \"Kolber\". \"Kolber\" is very often Jewish. We have seen the genealogies being whitewashed this way again and again. Changing one letter is often the best way to do it.Donald Trump's parents were Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. His grandparents were Friedrich Trump and Elizabeth Christ. Donald Trump has five children from three marriages: Donald John Trump Jr., Ivanka Marie Trump, and Eric Frederick Trump with Ivana Marie Trump; Tiffany Ariana Trump with Marla Ann Maples; and Barron Trump with Melania Knauss Trump.The Trump family has the largest number of Jews in the first family. All three married children of Donald Trump being married to Jews. That is no mere coincidence, it's a cohencidence. Four Generations of the Trumps beginning from Friedrich Trump (or Drumpf) have had close business and personal associations with Jews.",

          "contentraw": "Picture of Vladimir Putin at the World Economic Forum. Putin is not an idiot. NATO, DoD, CIA, FBI, B.A.R., Int’l Teachers &amp; Police Union, Blackrock, CDC, NIH, FDA, Federal Reserve Corporation, United Nations, Chinese &amp; Israeli Intelligence, Billionaire Bad Boys Club &amp; Int’l Corporations that consider China their base HAVE ALL STAGED AN ATTACK AGAINST HUMANITY. PUTIN HIT THE BIOWEAPONS LABS STAGED BELOW RUSSIA BY THE ENEMIES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LISTED ABOVE. <a href=\"https://gab.com/SvenVonErick\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@SvenVonErick<\/a> Millions of military age men are flooding into the US without uniforms &amp; are staging for an attack when the grid is shut off. Biden being told to throttle fuels, clean coal electricity, &amp; shut down Free Speech beyond what Obama did already. <br /><br />China wants to cause the US or Russia to strike the other first. So that is why, hopefully Taiwan, or other patriots for Freedom hit China’s 3 Gorges Dam. All this BS would stop instantly. There would be more mountains to climb than even, in history. The legitimate government of the US, after the Swamp is drained, would be forced to align with Iran, Russia, &amp; other countries likewise abused by the UN, World Economic Forum, Davos, Biderbergers, B.A.R. World Bankers, Central Bank, &amp; Chinese &amp; Israel Intelligence that puppeteers all of the US Alphabet Agencies &amp; all 3 Branches of the US Government. <br /><br />World Trade will then open back up, 2/3 of elected officials will end up in Gitmo along with most Judges, B.A.R., Judicial Branch will end up in Gitmo, hopefully, &amp; get what they planned for the rest of us, step by step. <br /><br />I advise all B.A.R. Members who are also Elected Officials to come clean, disavow ties &amp; testify against the coconspirators in front of a People’s Grand Jury. I would like to take advice from Tom Fitton, or similar to take some sort of a role as a US Private Attorney General. <br /><br />Barack Obama &amp; Eric Holder still need to face charges of accessories to murder for the “Fast &amp; Furious” program to send legal guns to Mexican Drug Gangs to commit murders as an excuse to officially suspend the US Constitution, &amp; especially the 2nd Amendment. All B.A.R. Association Elected officials &amp; the entire Judicial Branch, the DOJ, DHS leadership, CIA, FBI, DoD foreign run heads all need to face Felony Risk of Injury to Minors charges, accessory to murders charges for the true numbers of those injured &amp; murdered so far worldwide. <br /><br />Israel &amp; China need to be charged for theft of utilities. They have gotten away with spying on US Citizens, but they are stealing data from phones, causing prices &amp; taxes to rise for theft of utilities from the 1960s. China, Israel, World Bankers, I WANT THE MONEY BACK THAT YOU STOLE FROM ME. I WANT THE TOP PERPS TO HANG BY THE NECK UNTIL DEAD AFTER A FAIR TRIAL. <br /><br />W.B. Nemesis style banking just might save the Dollar &amp; all Sovereign Nation currencies.
