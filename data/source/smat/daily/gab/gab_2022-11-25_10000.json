            "description": "ION: PureBlood  ☦ on Gab: 'The Science: Vax-Induced Blood Clots Most Common Among Whites Because of Genetics\n\nAndrew Anglin \nApril 13, 2022\n\nYou can’t be racist against white people because white people are so powerful and rule over everyone.\n\nSo the vaccine isn’t racist for specifically targeting the genetics of white people. In fact, one might even call it anti-racist.\n\nMedical Xpress:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe rare blood clot side-effect associated with some COVID-19 vaccines could be the result of genetics, new research has found, paving the way for a potential genetic screening test.\n...\nNow, a new study by Professor Tom Gordon, Dr. Jing Jing Wang and colleagues from Flinders University and SA Pathology, may help to explain what’s causing the rare side effect. The study has been published on the pre-print server medRxiv and has yet to be peer reviewed.\n\nThe researchers looked at five unrelated people who had all experienced the clotting complication, finding all of the patients had unusually structured antibodies against a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is involved in blood clotting.\n\nAdditionally, all five had a specific version of a gene responsible for producing these antibodies.\n…\nThe researchers then found that all of the patients carried a specific variant of one gene, called IGLV3-21*02, most commonly occurring in people of European descent.\n…\nWhile the reason why only a tiny proportion of human vaccine recipients have this antibody requires further research, the authors say identifying the gene could make it possible to produce a genetic screening tool to identify patients who are at risk of this severe complication.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt’s shocking that an injection created by Jews, which Jews then forced people to take, would just coincidentally harm white people more than other races.\n\nAt this point, my position is that anyone who took these vaccines really just gets what they deserve.\n\nThe vax and the entire coronavirus hoax was pushed most aggressively by the World Economic Forum. Here is WEF leader Klaus Schwab’s top advisor, the Jew Noah Harari, saying that we need to get rid of humans:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4Q-dOZCzBSo\n\nBut they want to save you with a vaccine.\n\nThe Jewish Obamacare architect (and now top Biden coronavirus advisor) Zeke Emanuel was the first person I heard transforming “two weeks to flatten the curve” into “permanent lockdown until everyone is vaccinated.”\n(Cont/) https://dailystormer.cn/the-science-vax-induced-blood-clots-most-common-among-whites-because-of-genetics/'",

Cinematography by André Thomas. Music by Georges AuricTerence Young&#39;s feature bow is a visually striking and unashamedly melodramatic study in obsession that draws on the fantastical tales of Pygmalion, Bluebeard and Beauty and the Beast. Flashing back from Edana Romney&#39;s visit to the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud&#39;s, the narrative recalls her dalliance with Eric Portman, a boulevardier who is convinced that she is the reincarnation of the 15th-century Italian woman he believes he loved in a former life. Overlooking the grim secret of the mirrored corridor in Portman&#39;s mansion, Romney is torn between the finery showered upon her and the tightening grip of her admirer&#39;s fixation. Yet, the more eccentric the action gets (and the more manic Georges Auric&#39;s score seems), the more compelling it becomes. In her sole starring venture, Romney (who also co-scripted) isn&#39;t quite up to the task. But Portman is magnificently unhinged and Terence Verity&#39;s art direction is outstanding. ** by David Parkinson **",

Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed.

          "content": "Dr. Anthony Fauci said he could not recall key details about his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to one of the officials who questioned him on Nov. 23.Fauci, the director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984 and President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, was deposed by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, both Republicans.“It was amazing, literally, that we spent seven hours with Dr. Fauci—this is a man who single-handedly wrecked the U.S. economy based upon ‘the science, follow the science.’ And over the course of seven hours, we discovered that he can’t recall practically anything dealing with his COVID response,” Landry told The Epoch Times after leaving the deposition. “He just said, ‘I can’t recall, I haven’t seen that. And I think we need to put these documents into context,'” Landry added.“It was extremely troubling to realize that this is a man who advises presidents of the United States and yet couldn’t recall information he put out, information he discussed, press conferences he held dealing with the COVID-19 response,” Landry added later.Fauci and NIAID did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Landry declined to provide more details about the deposition until it is made public, which will happen at a future date. But he said officials would be able to take some of what they learned to advance their case.Landry and Schmitt sued the U.S. government in May, alleging it violated people’s First Amendment rights by pressuring big tech companies to censor speech. Documents produced by the government in response bolstered the claims. U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, the Trump appointee overseeing the case, recently ordered Fauci and seven other officials to testify under oath about their knowledge of the censorship.Doughty concluded that plaintiffs showed Fauci “has personal knowledge about the issue concerning censorship across social media as it related to COVID-19 and ancillary issues of COVID-19.”While Fauci qualified as a high-ranking official, the burden of him being deposed was outweighed by the court’s need for information before ruling on a motion for a preliminary injunction, Doughty said.Wednesday was the first time Fauci testified under oath about his interactions with big tech firms, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.Before the deposition, Landry said in a statement, “We all deserve to know how involved Dr. Fauci was in the censorship of the American people during the COVID pandemic; tomorrow, I hope to find out.”“We’re going to follow the evidence everywhere it goes to get down to exactly what has happened, to get down to the fact that our government used private entities to suppress the speech of Americans,” Landry told The Epoch Times.Great Barrington DeclarationJenin Younes with the New Civil Liberties Alliance, another lawyer representing plaintiffs in the case, said that Fauci claimed he did not worry about a document called the Great Barrington Declaration.Penned in October 2020, the document called for focused protection on people most at-risk from COVID-19 while rescinding the harsh restrictions that had been imposed on children and others at little risk from the disease.

          "contentraw": "Dr. Anthony Fauci said he could not recall key details about his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to one of the officials who questioned him on Nov. 23.<br /><br />Fauci, the director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984 and President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, was deposed by Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, both Republicans.<br /><br />“It was amazing, literally, that we spent seven hours with Dr. Fauci—this is a man who single-handedly wrecked the U.S. economy based upon ‘the science, follow the science.’ And over the course of seven hours, we discovered that he can’t recall practically anything dealing with his COVID response,” Landry told The Epoch Times after leaving the deposition. “He just said, ‘I can’t recall, I haven’t seen that. And I think we need to put these documents into context,'” Landry added.<br /><br />“It was extremely troubling to realize that this is a man who advises presidents of the United States and yet couldn’t recall information he put out, information he discussed, press conferences he held dealing with the COVID-19 response,” Landry added later.<br /><br />Fauci and NIAID did not immediately respond to requests for comment.<br /><br />Landry declined to provide more details about the deposition until it is made public, which will happen at a future date. But he said officials would be able to take some of what they learned to advance their case.<br /><br />Landry and Schmitt sued the U.S. government in May, alleging it violated people’s First Amendment rights by pressuring big tech companies to censor speech. Documents produced by the government in response bolstered the claims. U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty, the Trump appointee overseeing the case, recently ordered Fauci and seven other officials to testify under oath about their knowledge of the censorship.<br /><br />Doughty concluded that plaintiffs showed Fauci “has personal knowledge about the issue concerning censorship across social media as it related to COVID-19 and ancillary issues of COVID-19.”<br /><br />While Fauci qualified as a high-ranking official, the burden of him being deposed was outweighed by the court’s need for information before ruling on a motion for a preliminary injunction, Doughty said.<br /><br />Wednesday was the first time Fauci testified under oath about his interactions with big tech firms, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.<br /><br />Before the deposition, Landry said in a statement, “We all deserve to know how involved Dr. Fauci was in the censorship of the American people during the COVID pandemic; tomorrow, I hope to find out.”<br /><br />“We’re going to follow the evidence everywhere it goes to get down to exactly what has happened, to get down to the fact that our government used private entities to suppress the speech of Americans,” Landry told The Epoch Times.<br /><br />Great Barrington Declaration<br /><br />Jenin Younes with the New Civil Liberties Alliance, another lawyer representing plaintiffs in the case, said that Fauci claimed he did not worry about a document called the Great Barrington Declaration.<br /><br />Penned in October 2020, the document called for focused protection on people most at-risk from COVID-19 while rescinding the harsh restrictions that had been imposed on children and others at little risk from the disease. Two of its authors, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, are plaintiffs in the case.<br /><br />“I have a very busy day job running a six billion dollar institute. I don’t have time to worry about things like the Great Barrington Declaration,” Fauci said, according to Younes.<br /><br />Fauci, though, has spoken multiple times about the declaration.<br /><br />In internal emails that were later published, Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, Fauci’s former boss, both criticized the declaration. “There needs to be a quick and devastating published takedown of its premises,” Collins wrote, prompting Fauci to send him a Wired magazine article he claimed “debunks this theory.”<br /><br />In another missive, obtained by The Epoch Times through a Freedom of Information Act request, Fauci said the declaration reminded him of AIDS denialism.<br /><br />Fauci also talked about the declaration in public, including defending his criticism during a congressional hearing in May.<br /><br />“I have come out very strongly publicly against the Great Barrington Declaration,” Fauci wrote to Dr. Deborah Birx in another email.<br /><br /><br />[Click on my replies or link below for rest of article]<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/fauci-could-not-recall-key-details-during-deposition-louisiana-attorney-general_4882634.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theepochtimes.com/fauci-could-not-recall-key-<span class=\"invisible\">details-during-deposition-louisiana-attorney-general_4882634.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

He also proclaimed himself to be a vegan.<br /><br />SBF is well-connected, too. His father helped Elizabeth Warren draft legislation to revise the US tax code in 2016. His mother co-founded the secretive Democratic group Mind the Gap in 2018, which has funneled millions in donations to the Democrats. Mind The Gap ‘operates in a cone of secrecy’ but ‘speaks the language of Silicon Valley’, according to a Vox profile of the organisation. SBF’s brother, Gabe Bankman-Fried, used to work for Civis Analytics, the political data firm backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, which is behind much of the Democratic Party’s data operation.<br /><br />Cleverly, Bankman-Fried subscribes to the self-indulgent online cult of ‘effective altruism’, in which devotees outdo each other with claims of how moral they are – or would be, if only they were wealthier. Effective altruists say they are in favour of making money, which can then be donated to good causes. Professor Kathleen Stock describes the ‘movement’ as the ‘new woke’, beloved of ‘robotic tech bros’. These modern-day Pharisees don’t hide their good intentions under a bushel. Instead, they berate everyone else for not having the right priorities.<br /><br />Yet as SBF admitted in an exchange of messages with a fellow devotee and journalist last week, it was all a sham. Effective altruism was a cosplay outfit that Bankman-Fried could slip into with ease. It was ‘this dumb game we woke Westerners play where we say all the right shibboleths and so everyone likes us’, he admitted.<br /><br />On the surface, the fall of SBF is a familiar tale. A flood of funny money persuaded the political and administrative class to look the other way to FTX’s obvious shortcomings. But there is rather more to it than greed.<br /><br />It has been over a decade since Joel Kotkin identified just how much the Democratic Party had changed during the Obama era. By 2012, the Democrats had become an alliance of tech elites and finance, he wrote. The party came to represent both Google and Goldman Sachs.<br /><br />Although Bankman-Fried was neither a tech genius nor a financial wizard, he had the appeal of both, so long as one didn’t look too closely. He had the appearance of a dishevelled tech nerd and he carried Silicon Valley’s imprimatur. He was backed by leading financial investors from Softbank to Sequoia Capital. FTX was ‘Goldilocks perfect’, in the words of Sequoia partner Michelle Bailhe. And one suspects he must have initially made his backers a lot of money from the mysterious new alchemy of crypto finance.<br /><a href=\"https://rumble.com/v1x34ae-how-big-tech-took-over-the-democrats.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>rumble.com/v1x34ae-how-big-tech-took-over-the<span class=\"invisible\">-democrats.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Rand Paul’s amendment that would forbid the FISA court from issuing warrants targeting American citizens.<br /><br />Deep state supporters claim the expiring business records provision (which authorizes the collection of our communications and was at the center of Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations), lone wolf provision (which allows government to subject an individual with no known ties to terrorists to warrantless surveillance), and roving wiretaps provision (which allows government to monitor communications on any device that may be used by a targeted individual) are necessary to keep Americans safe. But, since Congress first passed the PATRIOT Act almost 20 years ago, mass surveillance, warrantless wire-tapping, and bulk data collection have not stopped a single terrorist attack.<br /><br />The legislation does have “reforms” aimed at protecting civil liberties, but these new protections contain loopholes that render the protections meaningless. For example, the bill requires those targeted for surveillance to be notified that the government spied on them. However, this requirement can be waived if the government simply claims — not proves but just clams — that notifying the target would harm “national security.”<br /><br />The notice provision also only applies to the target of an investigations. So, if you were caught up in a federal investigation because a coworker is being targeted and you shared an office computer, or if a store clerk reported to the government, you and oth-ers bought pressure cookers, the government could collect your phone records, texts, and social media posts without giving you the chance to challenge the government’s actions.<br /><br />The bill also makes some reforms to the special FISA court, which serves as a rubber stamp for the intelligence community. These reforms are mainly aimed at protecting political campaigns and candidates. They would not stop the FISA court from rubber-stamping surveillance on organizations that oppose the welfare-warfare-surveillance-fiat money status quo.<br /><br />Anything limiting warrantless wiretapping and mass surveillance should be supported.

The bill had already been rushed through the House of Representatives, and most expected it to sail through the Senate. But, instead, Senate leadership had to settle for a 77-day extension.<br /><br />Senate leadership was also forced to allow consideration of several amendments at a later date. Included is Sen. Rand Paul’s amendment that would forbid the FISA court from issuing warrants targeting American citizens.<br /><br />Deep state supporters claim the expiring business records provision (which authorizes the collection of our communications and was at the center of Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations), lone wolf provision (which allows government to subject an individual with no known ties to terrorists to warrantless surveillance), and roving wiretaps provision (which allows government to monitor communications on any device that may be used by a targeted individual) are necessary to keep Americans safe. But, since Congress first passed the PATRIOT Act almost 20 years ago, mass surveillance, warrantless wire-tapping, and bulk data collection have not stopped a single terrorist attack.<br /><br />The legislation does have “reforms” aimed at protecting civil liberties, but these new protections contain loopholes that render the protections meaningless. For example, the bill requires those targeted for surveillance to be notified that the government spied on them. However, this requirement can be waived if the government simply claims — not proves but just clams — that notifying the target would harm “national security.”<br /><br />The notice provision also only applies to the target of an investigations. So, if you were caught up in a federal investigation because a coworker is being targeted and you shared an office computer, or if a store clerk reported to the government, you and oth-ers bought pressure cookers, the government could collect your phone records, texts, and social media posts without giving you the chance to challenge the government’s actions.<br /><br />The bill also makes some reforms to the special FISA court, which serves as a rubber stamp for the intelligence community. These reforms are mainly aimed at protecting political campaigns and candidates. They would not stop the FISA court from rubber-stamping surveillance on organizations that oppose the welfare-warfare-surveillance-fiat money status quo.<br /><br />Anything limiting warrantless wiretapping and mass surveillance should be supported. However, nothing short of repeal of the USA FREEDOM Act will restore respect for our right to live our lives free of the fear that Big Brother is watching.<br /><br />read more&gt;<br /><a href=\"http://ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2020/march/23/like-freedom-then-you-won-t-like-the-freedom-act/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articl<span class=\"invisible\">es/2020/march/23/like-freedom-then-you-won-t-like-the-freedom-act/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

The founder donates to a vast network of conservative activists and publicly promotes causes that they hold dear. He has long-standing Republican Party family connections. He is lionised in Congress. Officials promise regulatory changes that will help his business. The co-founder of the operation is a curiosity, a Chinese-American with no public profile. Then the business goes bankrupt, losing ordinary Americans billions of dollars of their savings. Much of the money simply goes missing and is unaccounted for.Now imagine how the American media might have reported this affair over the past week or so. You can be sure the word ‘corruption’ would have featured prominently, along with the words ‘deep’ and ‘systemic’. We could be reading excoriating think-pieces on how greed persuaded people to look the other way. No doubt, some Substacks would have speculated on whether an absence of morality was a Republican trait. Yet with the dramatic collapse of FTX earlier this month, this kind of critique has been largely missing. So why might this be?The answer, of course, is that Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was not a Republican, nor did he donate to conservative causes. He was the second-largest Democratic donor in the 2022 election cycle. He shrewdly talked up the two big secular, liberal religions of climate change and artificial intelligence. He also proclaimed himself to be a vegan.SBF is well-connected, too. His father helped Elizabeth Warren draft legislation to revise the US tax code in 2016. His mother co-founded the secretive Democratic group Mind the Gap in 2018, which has funneled millions in donations to the Democrats. Mind The Gap ‘operates in a cone of secrecy’ but ‘speaks the language of Silicon Valley’, according to a Vox profile of the organisation. SBF’s brother, Gabe Bankman-Fried, used to work for Civis Analytics, the political data firm backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, which is behind much of the Democratic Party’s data operation.Cleverly, Bankman-Fried subscribes to the self-indulgent online cult of ‘effective altruism’, in which devotees outdo each other with claims of how moral they are – or would be, if only they were wealthier. Effective altruists say they are in favour of making money, which can then be donated to good causes. Professor Kathleen Stock describes the ‘movement’ as the ‘new woke’, beloved of ‘robotic tech bros’. These modern-day Pharisees don’t hide their good intentions under a bushel. Instead, they berate everyone else for not having the right priorities.Yet as SBF admitted in an exchange of messages with a fellow devotee and journalist last week, it was all a sham. Effective altruism was a cosplay outfit that Bankman-Fried could slip into with ease. It was ‘this dumb game we woke Westerners play where we say all the right shibboleths and so everyone likes us’, he admitted.On the surface, the fall of SBF is a familiar tale. A flood of funny money persuaded the political and administrative class to look the other way to FTX’s obvious shortcomings. But there is rather more to it than greed.It has been over a decade since Joel Kotkin identified just how much the Democratic Party had changed during the Obama era. By 2012, the Democrats had become an alliance of tech elites and finance, he wrote. The party came to represent both Google and Goldman Sachs.Although Bankman-Fried was neither a tech genius nor a financial wizard, he had the appeal of both, so long as one didn’t look too closely. He had the appearance of a dishevelled tech nerd and he carried Silicon Valley’s imprimatur. He was backed by leading financial investors from Softbank to Sequoia Capital.

Inflation is now 7.7%.<br /><br />Gas is $3.59/gallon. (AAA)  2 ✖️ the cost of Trump gas. <br />Mayor Pete has no sympathy. \"After all, that was the plan.\"<br /><br />RCP averages: Joe's job approval rating spread is -12.6%.<br />His job approval avg.: 41.7%.👎 WAY too high, imo.<br />Quinnipiac reports 36, -19.

James Comer (R-Ky.), the incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told Just the News that fighting the Biden administration for access to some 150 Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) filed by banks concerning Hunter Biden's financial transactions would allow investigators to determine to what extent, if any, Joe Biden benefited from his son's foreign influence peddling.\"This isn't a fishing expedition,\" Comer told the John Solomon Reports podcast this week. \"We have every reason to believe that Hunter Biden was paying for living expenses for Joe Biden, a significant amount of living expenses.

Afterwards, they chose to divert Joe Biden's Delaware state tax refund to Hunter Biden to pay off money the father owed his son, the emails state.\"I am depositing it in his account and writing a check in that amount back to you since he owes it to you,\" Rosemont Seneca official Eric Schwerin wrote in June 2010 about Joe Biden's tax refund. \"Don't think I need to run it by him, but if you want to go ahead.\"Another Schwerin email a month later entitled \"JRB bills\" — using the future president's initials — listed a series of expenses from Joe Biden's lakefront home in Wilmington, Del., that Hunter Biden had paid.They included $1,239 of air conditioner repairs at \"mom-mom's cottage\" and another $1,475 to paint the \"back wall and columns at the lake house.\" There was $475 \"for shutters\" and $2,600 for building or repairing a \"stone retaining wall at the lake.\"Comer said he and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) are collaborating on the Biden family corruption probe, with Jordan taking lead on why it has taken the FBI four years to investigate the serious allegations. Some FBI whistleblowers have alleged politics played a role in sidelining some aspects of the Hunter Biden probe that has been underway since 2018.Hunter Biden has acknowledged he is under investigation, but he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.Comer said House GOP investigators believe the FBI may have tried to keep the laptop contents secret, unaware there were multiple copies floating around beyond the one they seized from a Delaware computer repairman back in December 2019.\"When the laptop guy gave the computer to the FBI, they were under the assumption that there were no copies,\" he said. \"That was it.

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",
