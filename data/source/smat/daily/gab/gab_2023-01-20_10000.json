Why isn't there outage and a demand of an investigation into his death if nothing else from his parents?  Something killed these two boys (and many other kids) and our authorities and medical establishments can't be bothered to investigate their deaths.  Until proven otherwise I think it is safe to say that the Covid jabs killed them both (and probably every other sudden and unexpected child/teen death in Canada.<br /><br />At what point will they change the status to \"sudden and expected\" for those who have injected the poisons?  I suspect insurance companies to eventually call these suicides as the injections were and still are experimental with a now known side-affect of death.  Why would anyone inject themselves with a substance with a known side-affect of death no matter how remote the possibility?",

Being able to contact Eric Buell directly, I was given a \"race only\" ignition box from him, the dimensiins for the spacers to convert to chain drive and a few tuning tricks to actually pull the 100hp Buell advertised it had.  Totally stock, it dyno'd at 89.  So with some carb work, airbox swaps, ignition module and tinkering I pulled 100 legit hp.  I swapped the original tank with a cyclone tank for 2.1 more gallons of fuel, went through a few exhausts until I found one that wouldnt shake apart at the seams after 1500 miles.  And rode the shit out of it for 15years.  Its sitting near 63,000 miles on its original guts, though it is due for a new carb and top end.  The whole bike will be broken down and gone through with the intention of running it at Bonneville to sate a dream Ive had since I can remember.  I had it clocked via radar at 148mph on asphalt so Id like to see if I can tickle 150 with gearing mods and a good tune.  But, really I just want to run the salt before I kick the bucket.",
