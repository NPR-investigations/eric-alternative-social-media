A temporary place for people to work towards creating a living wage trade.\n\nPresident Trump created 8,700 Opportunity Zones, largely in low-income minority neighborhoods. Incentives have attracted some $75 billion in private investment to these communities.\n\nBiden's THuGs burned them down.\n\nBrowsing through this list will expose them and enlighten you as to how pervasive anti-Americans are.\n",

In this age of deception, can we even trust anything we hear on the news?  We're not about how many people we can get into our group here.  We have no interest in being a group that is 5 miles wide and 2 inches deep.  In this group, you're going to hear things that 95% of today's average Christians may not understand because dealing with it would make them uncomfortable and today's average American Christian desires comfortable Christianity above all else.  That is because today's church is under very deep deception that Jesus told us to watch closely for in the last days.   If you are looking for deeper insights on where we really are on the prophetic timeline, then this may be a group you want to join.   If you are waiting to be raptured away before the tribulation begins, just before the real Christians will likely have to suffer persecution for their faith, you probably won't want to join this group.  ALL POSTING IN THIS GROUP SHOULD relate directly to last days events as prophesied in the Bible and ALL LINKS MUST HAVE AT LEAST A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS BEING LINKED TO.  All posts that do not relate directly to final days events as prophesied in the bible will be removed.  Haters/disrespecters will be banned, as will pretentious theological pontificators seeking to argue every nuance of every post.",

You know, she loves to hear from people. So I told her that I would make an attempt to do that within the next couple of days, but she&#39;s doing all right. Just coming back from the Clay Clark reawakening tour, and they had a great time this weekend. It&#39;s always amazing to be with your Patriot family and friends, so I know how she feels about that. But, um, I was talking to you guys about Marie and coming on today, and when she comes on, I just wanna let you guys know I&#39;m not gonna be rude. I just, she&#39;s gonna come up cuz she doesn&#39;t have a lot of time to spend with us, and she wants to talk to us about the book, uh, letters from the Gulag, and she wants to talk to everybody about Patriot mail projects. So that&#39;s going to be a thing today. And, uh, I&#39;m hearing that you&#39;re not feeling too good. I didn&#39;t hear that part before I hung up, Eric. I&#39;m sorry, hun.

I&#39;ll put my,Speaker 1    00:01:10    I&#39;ll put my 2 cents in. Uh, I, you probably didn&#39;t hear this part. Um, got a, uh, notification. I got, uh, information from Ri uh, Rachel Ryan, Sam&#39;s wife, uh, notification that Ryan tried to go see and get medical, uh, attention at the jail. Uh, and from Lewisburg has refused to see Ryan again today. That&#39;s Ryan. And he also asked the nurse, and he also asked the nurse, he asked, also asked the nurse to check him out, and she also refused and, and told him that he is a liar and Ryan&#39;s not. Uh, she says that Ryan says he is not feeling very, very good right now with his health, so, all right. Um, we&#39;re gonna have to Yeah. Do another round of letting them, letting them know that we&#39;re still, you know, we&#39;re gonna be on this and, and letting him know. Uh, so yeah, Nicki, uh, Nika is gonna do another little, little letter and, uh, we&#39;ll go, we&#39;ll go another round and send, uh, send out, do some phone calls and some more emails. Again, looks likeSpeaker 0    00:02:08    This is worth making a trip up to Pennsylvania to visit the Marshalls in person and go to the jail. I mean, I&#39;ll sit there and pick jail. I&#39;ll stand out there. I don&#39;t, I mean, I don&#39;t know. I think it&#39;s so serious at this point that we get this guy help. And I think that Sean was absolutely right. He&#39;s got pertinent information that could really exonerate a lot of people. His story needs to come out, but if they kill him, they, which is what they&#39;re trying to do. I think this, we&#39;ve gotta take this like next level serious guys. I, that&#39;s very static and very heartbroken to hear this information. Actually, I&#39;m pissed.

I&#39;m gonna have to do some thinking about that one. Uh, yeah. This is not something that we&#39;re even remotely going to let go. Uh, I think that we need to involve more people, uh, Congress, his state representatives, uh, the governor. Uh, we&#39;re gonna have to start making some serious noise guys. Uh, I called the j the Marshals this morning again, of course, I got the same fucking email or, uh, voicemail. And, uh, I called the jail and the phone just rang off the hook. So obviously, you know, they know that we&#39;re onto them, so it&#39;s an even more reason for us not to let up in general. Is there any way, now that I&#39;m sitting here thinking about that you can get a way to, I can&#39;t get on Secure&#39;s app guys. I&#39;m banned. Okay. I can&#39;t talk to anybody other than snail mail. That&#39;s all I have available to reach out to these guys. I&#39;ve been banned. It&#39;s a long story. It&#39;s not even worth the conversation.
