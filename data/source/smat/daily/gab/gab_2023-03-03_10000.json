The West Indies Interest argued that the slave trade contributed to British wealth. Ironically, they were making the same argument as some who now scorn the abolitionists.Abolitionism flourished from the 1780s onwards, but the wars against revolutionary France sidelined efforts to reform. Between 1793 and 1804, abolitionism made little progress because of the ruling class‚Äôs counter-revolutionary attack on all reform causes, which it linked to the French Revolution.In 1793, ‚ÄúBritain went to war against France; the political atmosphere at Westminster became more tense; and the government avoided any issue that might detract from the national interest. Slavery was one such issue. General radical developments were another. Any hope for furthering reform causes received a severe jolt as the government concentrated on what were the mainsprings of eighteenth-century parliamentary life - war, finance and foreign policy.‚ÄùThe ruling class was ‚Äúpreoccupied with winning the war against Napoleon and maintaining the status quo in terms of political power in the aftermath of that conflict ‚Ä¶‚ÄùBy 1807, developments in the war, mainly Napoleon‚Äôs blockade on British shipping, ‚Äúhelped to persuade politicians that it was patriotic to oppose France by cutting off its supply of slaves while Britain was at war.‚Äù Abolition of the trade could be sold as part of the war effort.‚Äú‚Ä¶ it was only after 1820 that the West Indies Interest came under political threat. ‚Ä¶ In the first reformed parliament held after 1832 sixteen out of thirty-five West Indians lost their seats. All of the losers, unsurprisingly, had voted against parliamentary reform. The West Indies Interest never recovered its influence after slave emancipation.‚ÄùFamously, Eric Williams argued that the profits from the slave trade ‚Äòprovided one of the main streams of accumulation of capital in England which financed the Industrial Revolution‚Äô.

The West Indies Interest argued that the slave trade contributed to British wealth. Ironically, they were making the same argument as some who now scorn the abolitionists.<br /><br />Abolitionism flourished from the 1780s onwards, but the wars against revolutionary France sidelined efforts to reform. Between 1793 and 1804, abolitionism made little progress because of the ruling class‚Äôs counter-revolutionary attack on all reform causes, which it linked to the French Revolution.<br /><br />In 1793, ‚ÄúBritain went to war against France; the political atmosphere at Westminster became more tense; and the government avoided any issue that might detract from the national interest. Slavery was one such issue. General radical developments were another. Any hope for furthering reform causes received a severe jolt as the government concentrated on what were the mainsprings of eighteenth-century parliamentary life - war, finance and foreign policy.‚Äù<br /><br />The ruling class was ‚Äúpreoccupied with winning the war against Napoleon and maintaining the status quo in terms of political power in the aftermath of that conflict ‚Ä¶‚Äù<br /><br />By 1807, developments in the war, mainly Napoleon‚Äôs blockade on British shipping, ‚Äúhelped to persuade politicians that it was patriotic to oppose France by cutting off its supply of slaves while Britain was at war.‚Äù Abolition of the trade could be sold as part of the war effort.<br /><br />‚Äú‚Ä¶ it was only after 1820 that the West Indies Interest came under political threat. ‚Ä¶ In the first reformed parliament held after 1832 sixteen out of thirty-five West Indians lost their seats. All of the losers, unsurprisingly, had voted against parliamentary reform. The West Indies Interest never recovered its influence after slave emancipation.‚Äù<br /><br />Famously, Eric Williams argued that the profits from the slave trade ‚Äòprovided one of the main streams of accumulation of capital in England which financed the Industrial Revolution‚Äô. But Morgan argues that ‚Äú‚Ä¶ slave trade profits did not have a significant influence on the British economy, as opposed to the private wealth of individuals ‚Ä¶‚Äù<br /><br />He concludes that ‚ÄúIt would be incorrect to claim that the wealth flowing home from the slave trade was a major stimulus for industrialization in Britain, but it would not be unfair to claim that the slave-sugar trading complex strengthened the British economy and played a significant, though not decisive, part in its evolution.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúThe veteran abolitionist Thomas Clarkson was not opposed to compensation for the planters.
