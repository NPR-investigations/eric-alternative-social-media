In a note from Deutsche Bank senior economist Eric Heymann, the largest German lender laid out the three most likely scenarios for what the post-maintenance period could look like. As Heymann writes, \"we developed three scenarios on how Russian gas supplies to Germany via Nord Stream 1 as well as the transition point Waidhaus might evolve over the next few months.\"Scenario 1: Status quo ante. Here, DB assumes that Russian gas deliveries return to the level we had seen in the weeks before the current maintenance period of Nord Stream 1, i.e. 60% below the level at the end of May.Scenario 2: Balanced on a knife-edge. Here, the bank assumes another halving of Russian gas supplies via both pipelines. That would correspond to only 20% of Russian gas supplies seen until May 2022 (this scenario was validated today as described in \"Gazprom Casts Doubt On Reopening Nord Stream Even As Canada Grants Sanctions Waiver For Stranded Turbines\").Scenario 3: This is the downside case: welcome to a winter of gas rationing. In a third scenario DB assumes that Russia completely turns off the gas taps to Germany after the maintenance period. That also includes supplies via Waidhaus over the next few months. This is quite a large number in historical comparison even though it is below the recent peak of roughly 3,000 GWh per day. The Netherlands and Norway have already increased their exports to Germany since late May by roughly 20% (with significant volatility).https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/deutsche-bank-now-modeling-german-households-chopping-wood-keep-warm-winter",

But to her children, Ivana Trump was a caring mother and friend who was devoted to her family.Troves of photos discovered by a South Florida collector back in 2014 show the beauty loved up with her ex-husband, Donald Trump, vacationing with her children and posing with homemade birthday cakes.Ivana, 73, passed away Thursday in her home in New York City's Upper East Side after suffering cardiac arrest. She is survived by her three children - Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka - and ten grandchildren.The intimate family pictures, previously shared with http://DailyMail.com, mainly span the decades of the 1970s through the 1990s - before Ivana and Donald split.The pile features candid shots, polaroids and agency pictures from the likes of society shooter Mary Hilliard to Ron Galella, dubbed the 'Paparazzo Extraordinaire' and the bane of favorite subject Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' existence.But more so, the photos show detail moments shared by the high-profile family behind closed doors.Photographs captured at Ivana and Donald's 1977 wedding show the model as a beautiful and radiant bride donning a rather simple white gown.She is pictured alongside her dashing groom as the pair exchanged vows at the altar of the Marble Collegiate Church in New York City.Dancing at the reception that followed are shots of the groom's folks Fred Sr., and Mary and the bride's parents, Milos Zeinicek and Marie Francova.Their love seemed to radiate throughout the early stages of their relationship. The couple was seen cozied up together at dinners, posing for photos on rooftops with champagne in hand and embracing each other in their luxurious home.",

Yes, technically under current law, even if a woman voluntarily goes into your house, you’re not allowed to hold her down and force yourself on her.

What most people don’t realize is that water itself can’t be made highly radioactive. H2O is just hydrogen and oxygen, of course, and although there are heavier isotopes of oxygen (with atomic masses of 17 and 18), they are stable and not radioactive. They can be used as isotopic markers in medical scans, but they don’t emit radiation themselves.When you realize that H2O can’t be made radioactive, you come to understand that what makes water radioactive is the contaminants suspended in the water, not the water molecules.If you mix powdered cesium-137 into water, for example, all the water seems radioactive. But it’s really just the cesium-137, not the H2O. Cesium is an element (Cs) just like oxygen is an element. If you remove the cesium, you remove the contaminant that’s radioactive, and you end up with clean H2O.Thus, you don’t need a special “anti-radiation” water filter to remove radioactive elements from water. Most high-quality filters will do the trick, as they remove lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, pesticides and other toxic elements or molecules as well.Coming soon: ICP-MS lab tests on the cesium removal capabilities of over a dozen major water filtersRight now, I’m gearing up to run ICP-MS tests (mass spectrometry) on the cesium removal capabilities of major water filters, including the Berkey, Katadyn, REI camping filters and more. We are going to use cesium-133 as the stable isotope for this experiment, and we will publicly release the results in a few weeks, along with percent removal ratings for the water filters we test.My initial assessment on this, by the way, is that most quality water filters are going to remove cesium contamination with very high efficiency. We will back this up with actual lab numbers and let the data speak for itself.Note that when the filter element is effective at removing the cesium contamination, it will concentrate the radioactive cesium in the filter element itself. This means your filter element is now radioactive. For this reason, you may wish to stock up on extra filter elements because you would likely want to swap them out with greater frequency than usual. In addition, you would want to treat this filter element as a hazardous, radioactive item, and follow all sensible guidelines for how to dispose of it, etc.Read morehttps://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-14-how-to-remove-radiation-from-water-nuclear-detonation-maps-inflation.html",

What most people don’t realize is that water itself can’t be made highly radioactive. H2O is just hydrogen and oxygen, of course, and although there are heavier isotopes of oxygen (with atomic masses of 17 and 18), they are stable and not radioactive. They can be used as isotopic markers in medical scans, but they don’t emit radiation themselves.<br /><br />When you realize that H2O can’t be made radioactive, you come to understand that what makes water radioactive is the contaminants suspended in the water, not the water molecules.<br /><br />If you mix powdered cesium-137 into water, for example, all the water seems radioactive. But it’s really just the cesium-137, not the H2O. Cesium is an element (Cs) just like oxygen is an element. If you remove the cesium, you remove the contaminant that’s radioactive, and you end up with clean H2O.<br /><br />Thus, you don’t need a special “anti-radiation” water filter to remove radioactive elements from water. Most high-quality filters will do the trick, as they remove lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, pesticides and other toxic elements or molecules as well.<br /><br />Coming soon: ICP-MS lab tests on the cesium removal capabilities of over a dozen major water filters<br /><br />Right now, I’m gearing up to run ICP-MS tests (mass spectrometry) on the cesium removal capabilities of major water filters, including the Berkey, Katadyn, REI camping filters and more. We are going to use cesium-133 as the stable isotope for this experiment, and we will publicly release the results in a few weeks, along with percent removal ratings for the water filters we test.<br /><br />My initial assessment on this, by the way, is that most quality water filters are going to remove cesium contamination with very high efficiency. We will back this up with actual lab numbers and let the data speak for itself.<br /><br />Note that when the filter element is effective at removing the cesium contamination, it will concentrate the radioactive cesium in the filter element itself. This means your filter element is now radioactive. For this reason, you may wish to stock up on extra filter elements because you would likely want to swap them out with greater frequency than usual. In addition, you would want to treat this filter element as a hazardous, radioactive item, and follow all sensible guidelines for how to dispose of it, etc.<br /><br />Read more<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-14-how-to-remove-radiation-from-water-nuclear-detonation-maps-inflation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>naturalnews.com/2022-07-14-how-to-remove-radi<span class=\"invisible\">ation-from-water-nuclear-detonation-maps-inflation.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
