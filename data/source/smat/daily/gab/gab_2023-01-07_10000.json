According to documents obtained by PILF, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Beall refused to give the names of 54 foreign nationals who were mailed the voter registration postcards in Moffat County.A spokesman for Beall told a Moffat County official there were “potential legal issues that need to be addressed before lists of erroneous recipients in each county can be shared” and that he did not have a timeline for when such issues would be resolved — “or if they can be at all.”Because the secretary of state’s office is refusing to cooperate with county officials, there is no way for them to check if such ineligible residents voted illegally in the 2022 midterms.As previously reported by The Federalist, the faulty mailer was the result of Colorado’s membership with the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a voter roll management system that ostensibly helps states register new voters. As part of its membership agreement, Colorado is obligated to send at least one voter registration mailer to eligible citizens per election cycle.As I’ve previously explained, ERIC comes up with a list of eligible but unregistered (EBU) potential voters for states by combining data from voter files, department of motor vehicles (DMV) records, and state agencies that perform voter registration functions. After crafting these lists, ERIC sends them to the states, which use them for voter registration outreach.Secretary of State Jena Griswold’s office blamed the mailing “error on a database glitch related to the state’s list of residents with driver’s licenses” — but ERIC openly admits it creates voter outreach lists using DMV data. In Colorado, foreign citizens may obtain driver’s licenses. (Griswold claimed “none of the noncitizen” drivers would be permitted “to register to vote if they [tried].”)Griswold’s office tried to remedy its “mistake” soon after by sending out a second round of postcards to recipients of the original mailer, explaining the qualifications to vote. The office also “built a mechanism into the online voter registration portal to prevent any of the 31,093 from using the system,” according to PILF.“Colorado shouldn’t be sending foreign nationals voter registration information,” PILF President J. Christian Adams said in a statement. “When they do, the public should be able to see all of the records so we can hold election officials accountable. Transparency in elections is essential. This circus right before a federal election shouldn’t happen. Knowing who is to blame and what went wrong is essential to prevent a repeat.”PILF is currently suing the Colorado Secretary of State’s office for its failure to make public its voter list maintenance records with ERIC. Press Liason Annie Orloff of the secretary of state’s office did not respond to The Federalist’s request for comment asking if any of the 31,000 recipients of the mailer voted in the November general election.",

We’d like to give you this free Bible. It’s ‘Another Testament of Jesus Christ.’”____________________A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.",

Repent, and believe in the gospel.”<br />2 TIMOTHY 3:5 (NKJV)<br />(...)having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!<br />____________________<br />2 PETER 3:8-9 (NKJV)<br />But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.<br /><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>biblegateway.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br />____________________<br />SOUND FAMILIAR? (#1)<br />{*DOORBELL*} “Hi. We’d like to invite you to our special meeting on Wednesday. In the meantime, here’s some literature. We call it ‘The Watchtower’.”<br />SOUND FAMILIAR? (#2)<br />{*DOORBELL*} “Hi. We’d like to give you this free Bible. It’s ‘Another Testament of Jesus Christ.’”<br />____________________<br />A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.<br /><br />An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).<br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.",
