He recently spoke out at a school board meeting decked out in his best BLM t-shirt.“My name is Eric Rohman. I am a resident, townie, taxpayer, vaccinated, and functioning graduate of this high school, class of 1999, proud member of the LGBTQIA community, and an employee of Mt.

Steve Bannon was found guilty of contempt of Congress. So what? Who cares? The man got subpoenaed by a select committee that is a political circus. The January 6 Select Committee has been working hard to embarrass itself, trying to make this riot something that it's not. It was not Pearl Harbor. You won't indict Trump on anything. Also, no one is watching this kabuki theater. Its dissolution is coming. One of House Republicans' first acts upon regaining the majority in the chamber is getting rid of this clown show trial. Also, strip Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her squad of all their committee assignments. Yet, I digress.Unless you were equally appalled by Obama Attorney General Eric Holder's refusal to turn over Department of Justice documents about botched gun-walking Operation Fast and Furious in 2012, I don't want to hear it. The gun-walking operation was a mess that got Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry killed. He was murdered by one of the guns in this scandal:The House has voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress over his failure to turn over documents related to the Fast and Furious scandal, the first time Congress has taken such a dramatic move against a sitting Cabinet official.And, of course, why did Holder escape further legal action regarding his contempt of Congress showdown? An Obama-appointed federal judge refused to go along with these motions…The vote was 255-67, with 17 Democrats voting in support of a criminal contempt resolution, which authorizes Republicans leaders to seek criminal charges against Holder. This Democratic support came despite a round of behind-the-scenes lobbying by senior White House and Justice officials - as well as pressure from party leaders - to support Holder.…Another civil contempt resolution, giving the green light for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to sue the Justice Department to get the Fast and Furious documents, passed by a 258-95 margin. Twenty-one Democrats voted for that measure.But dozens of other Democrats marched off the floor in protest during the vote, adding even more drama to a tumultuous moment in the House chamber.This Bannon story isn't serious stuff, folks; you all know this. It's all games. They're coming after people who worked for Trump because they can't get the former president. The Democrats picked up where they left off with Holder regarding the DOJ being weaponized as a private political police force. What crime did Trump commit? I'm still waiting on an answer for that that isn't slow-baked in pure hatred of the man. Opinions are not evidence.",

LOUIS – St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones signed a bill Thursday to fund abortion travel assistance. As a result, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued the city.Jones was joined by several aldermen and advocates in signing a bill to create the reproductive equity fund in response to Missouri’s ban on abortions.“Abortion bans hurt the young girls who have to cross state lines to get abortion care because their state no longer makes an exception for rape or assault,” said Jones.After the bill was signed, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt immediately filed a lawsuit to block the city ordinance, which he said is plainly illegal. St. Louis mayor is defiant.“If the attorney general thinks that he knows better than St. Louisans about our rights, our doctors, our health care and our neighborhoods and our needs then I say bring it,” said Jones.St. Louis County Council voted to defeat a similar bill.“It’s unlawful to use tax dollars, federally and state tax dollars for any type of abortion-related services,” said St. Louis County Council member Tim Fitch.Three Republicans and one Democrat on the county council voted against the measure. There were three Democrats who voted for it.Fitch who opposes the bill said if it passed it would set the county up for a lawsuit against Missouri Attorney General.“They knew it would be unlawful to do it, so that money would be basically set aside and sit in the bank, said Fitch. “We wouldn’t be able to spend it to spend it on current needs that we have because that money would encumber a sitting in an account and not be able to be used because they know its unlawful to use it for that purpose.”",

It is a matter of when. “We [Hungarians] are not a mixed race, and we do not want to become a mixed race either” – this is what Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said during his address in Tusnádfürdő (Baile Tusnad), in Central Romania today. Beforehand, he slammed Western European countries and politicians for encouraging illegal migration and mixing their population. He said that Western-European cities were lost to the non-European population. Orbán argued that the West moved to Central Europe, suggesting that this region would be Europe’s future. ...Addressing the Bálványos Summer University in Baile Tusnad (Tusnádfürdő), Romania, on Saturday, Orbán said the West was fighting against central Europe together with Brussels and financier George Soros’s “troops” to “force migrants on us”. Orbán said Hungary’s greatest challenge was that deaths still outstripped births, with no change of the tide in sight. “Our situation has improved but there is still no turnaround, and without a turnaround, Hungary and the Carpathian basin will sooner or later be “repopulated” away from us,” he said. Migration has divided Europe, he said. “The West is split in two”, with one half comprising countries where European and non-European peoples live together. “Those countries are no longer nations,” he said. “In a spiritual sense, the West has moved to central Europe,” he said. The two halves of Europe are locked in a battle, he said. The West has rejected central Europe’s desire to allow each nation to live as they like, “and they continue to fight central Europe to change us to be like them,” he said. https://dailynewshungary.com/orban-hungarians-are-not-a-mixed-race-and-does-not-want-to-become-one/",
