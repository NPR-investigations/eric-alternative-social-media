Such an old semi-rotten brain with a low ‚Äúcharge‚Äù can drag all the light out of that boy (as shown on many social media). \n\nThen let‚Äôs look at the USA, the land of the broken penis. \nWe rarely hear about circumcision among American New Age movements. \nAs an example, just like among many Jews, in USA it‚Äôs a custom to perform the circumcision on new born boys. \nIt‚Äôs a tremendous shapeshifter event ‚Äì everything human can and will be dragged out, or even sucked out by old snake men (mohalims, doctors or rabbis). ‚Ä®Breaking the human blueprint of the bioelectrical setup will inevitable form a phantom-limb ‚Äì even more because of that very sensitive area/part. \nAs a matter of fact it does create a phantom tunnel toward the so-called Thoth-monsters in the bottomless abyss, as shown in CG Jungs and Aliester Crowleys teaching (Da¬¥arth). The human setup can and does over time shape-shift into something very reptil or snakelike - with some dumb third eye (Pyramid-sign)‚Ä®Jung spoke about ‚ÄúThe Shadow‚Äù, a demonic entity capable of show any kind of persona. Precisely that is what many name as ‚ÄúThe Shadow Government‚Äù of ‚ÄúDeep State‚Äù.  \nMKUltra is just a natural evolution of circumcision. Now we are in a phase where circumcised or not, doesn‚Äôt really matter anymore, as everthing alike can be done by bioenginering and assorted electromagnetic exposure. \n\n\nhttps://ia804508.us.archive.org/35/items/brice-taylor-thanks-for-the-memories-with-pictures-large-font/Brice%20Taylor%20-%20Thanks%20for%20the%20memories%20%28WITH%20PICTURES%20LARGE%20FONT%29.pdf'",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to clutch their pearls ‚Äî and beg \"The Big Guy\" to once again \"ignore\" the Constitution.After the Texas judge issued his decision, Wyden tweeted: \"... the Biden administration can and must ignore the judge and keep mifepristone on the market and this medication available for every woman in America.\"AOC parroted much the same notion to CNN's Anderson Cooper, flatly telling him, \"The Biden administration should ignore this ruling,\" after which she appeared on Dana Bash's CNN program and said the same thing.Bash feigned surprise, stating: \"That's a pretty stunning position!  If you think about it, in the, in the abstract, about the notion of just ignoring a judge's position.  So, my question is, when this case is resolved by the Supreme Court, should the administration follow that decision, if that decision ends up banning this abortion drug?\"To this, liberal leftists would probably reply: \"Of course not.

It's just common sense, right?Wyden tweeted that the abortion pill is \"medication,\" clearly illustrating that many radical Democrats see pregnancy as an......\"illness\".That is sick.
