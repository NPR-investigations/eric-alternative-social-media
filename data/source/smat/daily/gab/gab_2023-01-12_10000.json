The Bible discusses it at length, and just how important it is for a Christian to engage in it with the proper edification in place (Eph. 6:11-18). On a recent interview on The Eric Metaxas Radio Show, host Eric Metaxas brought up an interesting statement that his guest, political activist and strategist Roger Stone, said to him prior to the show. “I think that… a portal, a demonic portal, opened above the White House around the time that the Biden’s moved in,” Stone said. “This was brought to my attention by a Christian who lives in north Florida who sent me a bunch of documents and also a bunch of notations from the Bible about portals.” Metaxas responded to this revelation of Stones with skepticism, and rightfully so. “Well… I mean you should start out by being skeptical. That sounds… that sounds insane to me.” Stone continued with the discussion, and just what exactly convinced him that this was no far-fetched hoax, but a real occurrence in the world: “So, I was skeptical about it, but I looked at the photos. Also, there’s a live cam where you can actually see in real-time and there does appear to be something above the White House… At first you say, ‘Oh, maybe it’s a reflection. Maybe it’s an aerostat balloon. Maybe there’s a logical [explanation.]'” Having his curiosity piqued, Stone reached out to a friend who works as a police officer in Virginia to investigate the situation. “He called me back about two-and-a-half hours later and said, ‘You’re not going to believe this, but there’s definitely something there.

Also, there’s a live cam where you can actually see in real-time and there does appear to be something above the White House… At first you say, ‘Oh, maybe it’s a reflection. Maybe it’s an aerostat balloon. Maybe there’s a logical [explanation.]'” Having his curiosity piqued, Stone reached out to a friend who works as a police officer in Virginia to investigate the situation. “He called me back about two-and-a-half hours later and said, ‘You’re not going to believe this, but there’s definitely something there. Other people were there photographing it,'” Stone claimed…https://www.charismanews.com/culture/90958-roger-stone-tells-eric-metaxas-a-demonic-portal-opened-above-the-white-house",

Ilhan Omar (MN), Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA), and Rep. Adam Schiff (CA) have constantly poked their fingers in the eyes of Republicans every chance they have gotten.McCarthy told Punchbowl News in an interview published Tuesday that he will prevent Schiff and Swalwell from sitting on the House Intelligence Committee and will boot Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.“Swalwell can’t get a security clearance in the private sector. I’m not going to give him a government security clearance,” McCarthy said. “Schiff has lied too many times to the American public. He should not be on Intel.”On Monday, McCarthy had also remarked on the forthcoming ban to Associated Press reporters.“It’s not like it’s anything new,” McCarthy added. “Remember, this is what Nancy Pelosi – this is the type of Congress she wanted to have.”In an interview with Breitbart News a year ago, McCarthy laid out his plans to block them from coming back onto their influential committees.“The Democrats have created a new thing where they’re picking and choosing who can be on committees,” McCarthy said. “Never in the history [of Congress] have you had the majority tell the minority who can be on committee. But this new standard which these Democrats have voted for—if Eric Swalwell cannot get a security clearance in the private sector, there is no reason why he should be given one to be on Intel or Homeland Security. He will not be serving there.”“Ilhan Omar should not be serving on Foreign Affairs,” McCarthy also said. “This is a new level of what the Democrats have done.”In addition, McCarthy said he would also prevent Adam Schiff (D-CA) from serving on the Intelligence Committee.“You look at Adam Schiff—he should not be serving on Intel when he has openly, knowingly now used a fake dossier, lied to the American public in the process and doesn’t have any ill will [and] says he wants to continue to do it,” McCarthy said. “We’re going to reshape—think about what happened in Afghanistan. Why did Afghanistan collapse so fast? Was the Intel Committee under Adam Schiff focused on impeachment and not on the safety of America? Why are people coming across the border that are on a terrorist watch list? What are they doing about it? Their own members on that committee say it’s not happening when it’s true. We need to have an Intel Committee that looks at what’s happening around the world and keeps America safe. It should do exactly what it was created [to do]—overseeing of our agencies and others. We’re going to hold people to a higher standard in the process if they want to be on the Intel Committee and the training to be a part of it. Take the politics out of it.”In 2021, then Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat majority stripped Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and removed Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) from their committee assignments.Eric Swalwell reacted on Twitter by claiming that McCarthy’s maneuver was no more than the GOP getting “vengeance” against them.Attorney Jenna Ellis provided the full transcript showing that Donalds had made no such remark.Conservatives were quick to point out what Swalwell’s removal was really all about.“You’re the guy that had an affair with a Chinese spy, right?” lawyer and commentator Viva Frei replied. “Yep, no reason whatsoever.”“Fang Fang says ‘cry harder, Eric’,” BlazeMedia’s Sara Gonzalez quipped.“Actually it’s because you banged a Chinese spy,” Dave Rubin noted.As for Ilhan Omar, the Squad member has made numerous incendiary remarks about Republicans. Adam Schiff, of course, was a key player in the Russia Hoax and the two impeachment hoaxes. America is still waiting for his “direct evidence” of Trump-Russia collusion.As for Kevin McCarthy, it looks thus far like he is going to fight fire with fire. Let’s hope that this act of “vengeance” is the first of many.

This film traces Jeff Beck's music and career throughout the 1960s - his formative influences and early groups, his work with The Yardbirds, his brief, bizarre reinvention by producer Mickie Most as a solo pop star, and the first, radical incarnation of the Jeff Beck Group, during which he played alongside vocalist Rod Stewart and then bass player Ron Wood.Featuring a plethora of rare performance and studio footage, exclusive interviews, contributions from those who worked with and alongside Jeff during this period and a host of other features, all of which combine to make this documentary - the first yet to singularly focus on Beck's career - a legitimate tribute and enthralling history of this often underrated musician, writer and performer. Includes new interviews with: Yardbirds first manager, Giorgio Gomelsky; the man who took over from Gomelsky, colourful music biz impresario, Simon Napier Bell; Jeff's fellow Yardbirds, Jim McCarty &amp; Chris Dreja; musical conspirators from the early 70s, Tim Bogert &amp; Max Middleton; the ever shocking Pamela Des Barres (aka Miss Pamela of The GTOs); legendary music press scribes, Charles Shaar Murray &amp; Chris Welch; Beck's official biographer Martin Power and Uncut Magazine editor, Nigel Williamson. https://youtu.be/4kyqEFwrZNo",

What sort of impact is the addition of millions of people who can’t legally work, mostly don’t pay taxes and need food, shelter and education having on our communities?Democrats are trying to hide the answers to these questions, to keep secret the true price of Biden’s ineptitude.Consider just one cost. Mayor Eric Adams has set up four “emergency shelters” in New York City hotels — the Stewart, the Row, the Wolcott and the Watson. Whistleblower Row employee Felipe Rodriguez revealed to The Post that the city is spending $400-$500 a night on rooms there.The mayor won’t reveal the confirmed cost to us, but some rough estimates reveal the ballpark pricetag.These hotels have 2,745 rooms. As The Post reported last week, all four are turning away migrants, saying every room is full.So that’s costing New York City an estimated $1 million-$1.37 million a day. That’s $365 million-$500 million a year.We only know this much because of Rodriguez’s bravery. We don’t know the cost of food, or for schools or for social services.While not revealing specifics, Adams has requested $1 billion from the feds. They’ve given him a whopping $8 million.So the Biden strategy is: Every city and state for themselves. As The Post has reported, the administration is flying illegal immigrants into random small airports and leaving shocked local communities to handle them. They leave it to El Paso to bus people to Chicago, while Colorado gets them a ticket to New York.",

The band's core lineup featured vocalist and harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty, rhythm guitarist and later bassist Chris Dreja and bassist/producer Paul Samwell-Smith.The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including \"For Your Love\", \"Heart Full of Soul\", \"Shapes of Things\" and \"Over Under Sideways Down\".Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks, the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneering psychedelic rock and early hard rock; and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock and heavy metal trends.Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance and guitarist Jimmy Page formed Led Zeppelin - the latter of which was initially intended as a direct successor to the Yardbirds.The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. They were included at number 89 in Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" and ranked number 37 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.The Yardbirds re-formed in the 1990s, featuring drummer Jim McCarty and rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja as the only original members.

We steal from walmart all the time. Become the nigger criminal, White Man, or lose!!By&nbsp;Michael SnyderFood has become a prime target for thieves, and that should deeply alarm all of us.
