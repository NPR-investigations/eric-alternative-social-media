We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

          "content": "何清涟：欧巴马留下的是一个严重分裂的美国社会2022-08-16 来源: 上报 作者: 何清涟左派的社会基础已经养就，万事俱备，只欠东风，美国左派终于等来了集所有的“政治正确”于一身的欧巴马，并将他成功地送进了白宫，从而完成了美国左派对本国的颜色革命。有“黑色马克思”之称的欧巴马执政八年，美国发生了非常深刻的变化：通过大规模移民改造了选民结构、司法系统严重政党化、选举政治第三世界化，最重要的是，他在第二任期的最后两、三年内，让自己的亲信进入了美国的几大主流媒体与Twitter、Facebook，稳妥掌握了话语权。还让美国出现了一些以前未有的“新生事物”，正如ACT For America在二〇二二年五月一日推文中所说：▪欧巴马之前，世界没有ISIS。（Before Obama，there was no ISIS.）▪欧巴马之前，美国没有“黑命贵”。（Before Obama，there was no BLM.）▪欧巴马之前，世界没有“安提法”。（Before Obama，there was no ANTIFA.）▪欧巴马之前，美国没有针对员警的战争。（Before Obama，there was no war on police.）▪欧巴马之前，美国远不像今天这样分裂！（Before Barack Hussein Obama，this country wasn&#39;t as divided as today！）欧巴马为美国的颜色革命做了充分的人力资源准备：一、一代信仰社会主义且仇恨资本主义的千禧青年二〇一六大选当中，信仰社会主义的桑德斯赢得了大量青年学生的狂热支持，美国社会将此称之为“左翼民粹”，与川普代表的“右翼民粹”一道成为美国的两道政治景观，并被西方媒体概括为“美国反全球化狂潮”的两支代表力量。右翼民粹的主体被左派媒体描绘成因为全球化而卖不出谷麦的农民、低薪蓝领、退休者……总之是一辈子没出过美国国门、又蠢又穷的低等阶层。左翼民粹的主体是千禧一代青年，多在大学求学。美国“共产主义受难者基金会”委托国际市场调查公司Yougov作了一项调查，主题是“美国人对社会主义的态度”，约两千多人接受了调查。调查发现，美国三十五岁以下的年轻人中，有百分之五十三的人对现行的经济体制不满，认为这个体制对他们不利，“社会主义”可行。百分之四十五的年轻人更愿意投票选举一位“社会主义者”来担任他们的总统——这是欧巴马任总统之前没有过的现象。二、日益尖锐的种族矛盾欧巴马深谋远虑，他留下的政治遗产当中，其中最重要的一项就是通过大规模引进非洲穆斯林人口及拉丁裔人口，为民主党构建了长达几十年的票仓。据美国国土安全部二〇一六年六月十七日公布的资料，欧巴马当政的二〇〇九至二〇一四年，美国共接收来自以穆斯林为主要人口国家的难民人数为八十三点二万。从二〇一五年开始，欧巴马大批接收叙利亚难民，穆斯林难民数量可能超过一百万。以二〇一六年为例，六月十二日奥兰多枪击案、同一时段内纽约、纽泽西多起爆炸案都是穆斯林移民所为，九月份明尼苏达州杀伤多人案的凶手，就是来自欧巴马祖籍肯亚的穆斯林移民。欧巴马政治发迹之地芝加哥，早已又重回罪恶之城，一年之内发生三千多起黑人之间的枪战。随着外来移民的增加及少数族裔尤其是拉丁裔的高生育率，美国人口结构发生变化。美国人口普查局的资料显示，二〇〇八年，白人人口比例占人口总数百分之六十六；二〇一九年，降至百分之六十点一。截至二〇一九年七月，千禧一代（一九八四-一九九五年出生），Z世代等年轻一代的总人数为一点六六亿，占全国人口的百分之五十点七，大于三十六岁以上的一点六二亿美国人，其中近一半被确定为有色种族或少数民族，据此推算，二〇四〇年白人人口将低于全美人口总数的一半。二〇二〇年十二月十一日，在拜登与贺锦丽和黑人民权运动领袖召开Zoom会议上，拜登称“这个国家注定要完蛋，注定要完蛋。不仅是因为非裔美国人，而是因为到二〇四〇年，欧裔白人将成为少数族裔。你们听到吗？你们这些人都得开始更多地跟西裔共事，他们所占比例将超过你们所有人。”除了鼓励非法移民合法化之外，民主党和一些社会团体出于自己的政治利益，还会有意宣传种族之间的矛盾，通过少数族裔的愤怒来赢得他们的廉价选票。这种情况让美国这一大熔炉被沙拉盆取代：人们意识到：“美国不是大熔炉，只是个沙拉盆”（America is not a melting pot but a salad bowl）。欧巴马留下的是一个严重分裂的美国社会。欧巴马：美国马克思主义培训的精品与其说欧巴马是美国发生颜色革命的原因，不如说是美国颜色革命悄然进行多年的结果，二〇二〇年五月下旬，“黑命贵”活动伴随着打砸抢在美国遍地开花，民主党众议院议长南茜等大佬带头在国会大厅向“黑命贵”下跪，一直处于半地下状态的“黑命贵”组织负责人终于在公共媒体上不断亮相，阐明这个组织信奉什么，要在现实生活中索取什么。二〇二〇年六月二十三日，“黑命贵”的联合创始人之一派翠丝.卡勒斯（Patrisse Cullors）女士在《现在即时新闻》上发表讲话，承认该组织成员是训练有素的马克思主义者，他们的议程比为非裔美国人伸张正义要简单得多。就是要让川普不参加大选，在十一月之前下台。等拜登上台后向他施压，要求其制定政策，改变警务和刑事定罪的关系。卡洛斯女士接受过十年培训的“劳工/社区战略中心”（the Labor/Community Strategy Center）由美国国内恐怖分子艾瑞克.曼恩（Eric Mann）办的接受过十年培训，曼恩与“地下气象人”这个恐怖组织的关系，让少数敏感的美国人立刻想起欧巴马与“黑命贵”之间有个共同的连络人，地下气象人的创办者比尔.艾尔斯（Bill Ayers）。在二〇〇八年总统大选前四十多天前的九月二十三日，《华尔街日报》曾刊发〈欧巴马和艾尔斯将激进主义推向学校〉一文，提到撰写了两本自传的欧巴马刻意隐藏的一段与艾尔斯有关的历史：从一九九五年到一九九九年，两人合作密切。CAC档案中的档清楚地表明，艾尔斯和欧巴马是CAC的合伙人，也是欧巴马的政治领路人，一九九五年，欧巴马首次参加伊利诺州参议院竞选是在艾尔斯家中举行的一次聚会上。但在二〇一八年总统大选中，由于艾尔斯的激进政治色彩与过去的纪录，欧巴马刻意淡化与艾尔斯的关系，将其称为“住在我家附近的一个人”。艾尔斯何许人也？这里有必要介绍“地下气象人”这个组织及其社会网路。维琪百科相关辞条这样介绍威廉.查理斯.艾尔斯（William Charles Ayers）：生于一九四四年十二月二十六日），美国基础教育理论家，退休前是芝加哥伊利诺大学教育学院的教授，曾获杰出教育教授和高级大学学者的称号。在一九六〇年代，艾尔斯曾是“地下气象人”组织的创建者与领导人，该组织反对美国卷入越南战争，是一个自称为共产主义的革命团体，旨在推翻帝国主义，终结美国帝国。为反对美国参与越南战争，地下气象人在一九六〇年代和一九七〇年代发起了轰炸公共建筑（包括杀死员警、在献给员警伤亡的雕像中植入炸弹、以及一系列轰炸五角大楼、三藩市警察局等公共建筑的活动）的运动。但艾尔斯人生最大的成功，不是作为“一九六八年人”的这些业绩，而是两大成就：一是作为“体制内新长征”的一员，成功地进入了美国的大学，成为教育家。他经常在演讲与教学中谈到“美国帝国的终结”，建立新世界，以及“我们在整个世界中应扮演的角色”，并在大学生培养左派激进分子。他的活动触角延伸至美国社会，利用自己的社会网路开办了各种培养左派社会运动人才的基地组织；二是做了一回造王者，将欧巴马成功推向总统宝座，深刻地改变了美国政治及社会结构。本文节录自黑体文化新书《马克思主义在美国》导读：〈美国民主灯塔的基座是如何被蛀空的〉。",
