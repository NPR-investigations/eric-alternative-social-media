Not all groups or organizations are willing to take a definitive stand and therefore will compromise to be “accepted”.

FL constitutional attorney KrisAnne Hall has been fighting this through legal means at her local and state level working with the few, true Republican legislators.

In “red” Brevard County when 3 Marxist school board members mandated ineffective and harmful masking of all students it was a clear violation of the Parents Bill of Rights statute. These 3 were not arrested by our Republican sheriff nor removed by the Governor. Instead of a voter recall (like done in far-left San Francisco) a local organization collected money to sue the school board in court. The Brevard school board did back off on their mask mandate but these elected public servants remain on the school board and still “tweet” their mask, CRT and now “vax” support. Plus there are other FL county school boards mandating masks. Currently some FL cities, counties, businesses and corporations openly violate state laws, constitutions or state department’s rules and regs. These are just a few realities of living in parts of “free and open” FL.",
