Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

Similarly, for objects of the same luminosity, the angular radius of an object in a non-expanding universe declines with redshift, while in an expanding universe this radius increases for redshifts z &gt; 1.25. The author and colleagues have previously shown that data for the surface brightness of disc galaxies are compatible with a static universe with redshift linearly proportional to distance at all z [static Euclidian universe (SEU) hypothesis]. In this paper, we examine the more conventional hypothesis that the universe is expanding, but that the actual radii of galaxies of a given luminosity increase with time (decrease with z), as others have proposed. We show that the radii data for both disc and elliptical galaxies are incompatible with any of the published size-evolution predictions based on an expanding universe. We find that all the physical mechanisms proposed for size evolution, such as galaxy mergers, lead to predictions that are in quantitative contradiction with either the radius data or other data sets, such as the observed rate of galaxy mergers. In addition, we find that when the effect of telescope resolution is taken into account, the r–z relationships for disc and elliptical galaxies are identical. Both are excellently fit by SEU predictions. An overall comparison of cosmological models requires examining all available data sets, but for this data set there is a clear contradiction of predictions based on an expanding universe hypothesis.https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/477/3/3185/4951333",

Similarly, for objects of the same luminosity, the angular radius of an object in a non-expanding universe declines with redshift, while in an expanding universe this radius increases for redshifts z &gt; 1.25. The author and colleagues have previously shown that data for the surface brightness of disc galaxies are compatible with a static universe with redshift linearly proportional to distance at all z [static Euclidian universe (SEU) hypothesis]. In this paper, we examine the more conventional hypothesis that the universe is expanding, but that the actual radii of galaxies of a given luminosity increase with time (decrease with z), as others have proposed. We show that the radii data for both disc and elliptical galaxies are incompatible with any of the published size-evolution predictions based on an expanding universe. We find that all the physical mechanisms proposed for size evolution, such as galaxy mergers, lead to predictions that are in quantitative contradiction with either the radius data or other data sets, such as the observed rate of galaxy mergers. In addition, we find that when the effect of telescope resolution is taken into account, the r–z relationships for disc and elliptical galaxies are identical.

It's like anyone who watched My Son Hunter and after all the things Facebook did to take out America and you're still posting on his evil, treasonous, Anti-American platform? Mark Zuckerberg is laughing his criminal ass off at your stupidity, how you say your an American yet hold NO ONE accountable for their criminal actions! Just accept, obey and move on as if nothing happened! Same with Deep State Fox News, here they were the FIRST to participate in our rigged 2020 Election, fired the ONLY AMERICA Lou Dobbs who would've exposed them, they're controlled by Deep State Paul Ryan, the gave Millions to the Biden Campaign and yet you still mindlessly watch and call yourself an American? How do we save America when all of you refuse to do your duty for God and Country, refuse to do the things in your power to save it?<br /><br />Really is holding Democrat Anti-American, Communist, Marxist BLM NFL, NBA and MLB accountable more important to you than God and Country? What you couldn't buy American? Couldn't stop funding and supporting Globalist, Anti-American Corporations? All you need to do is look in the mirror to see why America has met it's demise!!!",
