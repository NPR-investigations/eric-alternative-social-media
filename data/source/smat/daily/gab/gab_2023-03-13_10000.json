We are sending a tremendous amount of money more than Europe for the Ukrainian war without any knowledge as to how it is being spent.

I would like to say to Mr. Gowdy that when he was a member of Congress and the Republicans had the majority, Eric Holder was not charged with contempt, Hillary Clinton was not charged with obstruction, IRS, Lois Lerner was not charged with anything pertaining to her involvement with unjustly attacking the Conservative organizations. Lastly, I would like to say to Mr. Gowdy that he as well as 419 Congressmen and women saw the same numbers and the results of the 2020 election as the people who elected them to Congress. If they could not or would not initiate an investigation before confirming the results of the election, they could be charged for a coup or the real insurrection that was Nov. 2020.
