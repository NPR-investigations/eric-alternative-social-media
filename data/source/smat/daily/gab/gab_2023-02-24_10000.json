We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180¬∞ opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

Written by the President of the International Flat Earth Research Society and author of several other flat Earth books and documentaries, Eric Dubay recommends Flat Earth FAQ as both an ideal introduction to the subject for beginners, and a perfect coffee-table book for established flat earthers looking to tackle all the typical talking points.Table of Contents:1. How Do You Know Earth is Not a Spinning Globe?2. How Do You Know NASA Faked the Moon Landings?3. Why Would They Lie About Flat Earth?4. Why are There No Flat Earth Whistle-Blowers?5. Why are There No Photographs of the Flat Earth?6. Why is Earth the Only Flat Planet?7. Why Can't Everyone See Mount Everest on a Flat Earth?8. Why isn't Polaris Visible from Australia?9. Why Does the Moon Appear Upside-Down in the Southern Hemisphere?10. Why Do the Sun/Moon Get Bigger Near the Horizon?11. Ships Disappear Beyond Earth's Curvature?12.

How Can Ushuaia Get 17 Hours of Daylight on a Flat Earth?30. What is Above, Below, and Beyond the Flat Earth?31. How Did You Personally Learn About Flat Earth?32. Why is Flat Earth Important?The beautiful custom designed cover art is by fellow flat earther and artist Dino.  Dino is a self-taught artist, musician &amp; teacher from Boston whose work can be found at http://www.ARTofDiNo.com (artofdino@gmail.com). Together with his wife Erin Sarah of http://www.ARTofErinSarah.com, they formed a 501c3 public charity known as Save eARTh (http://www.SaveeARTh.us) with the goal of Saving eARTh with Art and HeART forever. Each Artwork is designed to expand the minds of all people of all ages in order to help everyone envision the infinite realm of potential we are all collectively re-discovering. These visions are meticulously crafted and packed with interconnecting symbolism that weaves a timeless story based on the perceptions of the viewer.Flat Earth FAQ is the culmination of over a decade's worth of deep research and writing on this most important subject jam-packed into an easily digestible reference book available in paperback, PDF and EPub/Kindle versions.  As many of you know, I have vowed never to stop my activism until the NWO dies or I do, and I see flat Earth as the Achilles' Heel of the New World Order.  This subject, supposedly the most crackpot of all conspiracy theories, mocked and ridiculed for centuries as being an ignorant unscientific worldview, is actually one of the most easily demonstrable and empirically evidenced facts of reality.  When humanity finally wakes up to the truth of our flat Earth, it will usher in a veritable new age of enlightenment, a renaissance of common sense, and an opportunity to finally and forever expose and expunge these deceivers among us.  As with all of my books, the contents will all soon be available FREE in article, video, and audiobook forms for those who cannot afford them.  Thanks so much to everyone who has helped over the years to support me and my mission of spreading the flat Earth truth to the entire flat world by purchasing and giving away my books to anyone and everyone who will read them!  http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubay",

Each Artwork is designed to expand the minds of all people of all ages in order to help everyone envision the infinite realm of potential we are all collectively re-discovering. These visions are meticulously crafted and packed with interconnecting symbolism that weaves a timeless story based on the perceptions of the viewer.<br /><br />Flat Earth FAQ is the culmination of over a decade's worth of deep research and writing on this most important subject jam-packed into an easily digestible reference book available in paperback, PDF and EPub/Kindle versions.  As many of you know, I have vowed never to stop my activism until the NWO dies or I do, and I see flat Earth as the Achilles' Heel of the New World Order.  This subject, supposedly the most crackpot of all conspiracy theories, mocked and ridiculed for centuries as being an ignorant unscientific worldview, is actually one of the most easily demonstrable and empirically evidenced facts of reality.  When humanity finally wakes up to the truth of our flat Earth, it will usher in a veritable new age of enlightenment, a renaissance of common sense, and an opportunity to finally and forever expose and expunge these deceivers among us.  As with all of my books, the contents will all soon be available FREE in article, video, and audiobook forms for those who cannot afford them.  Thanks so much to everyone who has helped over the years to support me and my mission of spreading the flat Earth truth to the entire flat world by purchasing and giving away my books to anyone and everyone who will read them!  <a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubay<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180¬∞ opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",
