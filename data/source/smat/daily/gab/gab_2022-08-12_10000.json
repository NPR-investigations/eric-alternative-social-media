            "content": "When the FBI did an unannounced raid on Bobi Jewell’s small apartment where her son Richard was staying during the Olympics, the agents ransacked her home. <br /><br />The FBI took many items. They even took ALL of Bobi’s tupperware. <br /><br />The FBI agents took Richard’s old Toyota pickup (which still ran like a top) on a tow truck to put it on a private plane which flew the truck to Quantico where it was completely disassembled and searched. Years later, I met the pilot who flew the plane with Richard’s truck on it to Quantico. He could not believe what the FBI did to Richard. He was disgusted with the FBI’s actions. <br /><br />The FBI later re-assembled the truck and returned it to Richard after finding NO incriminating evidence on any part of the truck. <br /><br />When Richard first went to drive his truck after it was returned, the truck would not crank.<br /><br />Not surprising. After all, it was re-assembled by the FBI. <br /><br />I do not believe the FBI stooped so low in their raid on Richard’s mother’s apartment as to rummage through Bobi Jewell’s clothing. <br /><br />It is shocking that the FBI rummaged through “the First Lady’s” clothing during its raid on Mar-A-Lago. <br /><br />But after what I witnessed FBI do to Richard and his mother in 1996, I guess I should not be shocked by anything the FBI does. <br /><br />Lin 🙏❤️🇺🇸<br /><a href=\"http://www.FightBack.law\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>FightBack.law<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

Another 12.4 percent said that they weren’t sure.A large majority of Republicans (76.7 percent) believe that Trump’s political enemies were responsible for the raid, while just 11.9 percent of Democrats gave the same answer.Another 70.5 percent of Democrats said that they believed the impartial justice system was behind the Mar-a-Lago raid.Among, independent respondents, 53.9 percent said that Trump’s enemies were responsible and 35.3 percent said that it was the impartial justice system.Soon after Monday’s raid, Eric Trump announced on Truth Social that Donald Trump is raking in the donations, likely in anticipation of a sooner-rather-than-later announcement he will run again for the White House in 2024.“Breaking: http://DonaldJTrump.com is shattering all fundraising records and I’m told has raised more money in the past 24 hours than ever before in recent history!

After leaving the Trump Administration in 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government and, later, encouraged Trump to declare martial law following the 2020 election.

This generated similar objections from church leaders and progressive groups there and prompted the state attorney general to send a letter to tour organizers raising her own concerns about the event.",

They would not give her a copy of the search warrant.\"<br />He also said that the FBI brought safe crackers in to break into his father's safe, and that agents rummaged through Melania Trump's wardrobe.<br /><br />\"It's all a coordinated attack with the FBI,\" said the former president's son, insisting that President Biden approved the raid.<br />\"Do you think that the FBI director is going to raid the former president's house, especially a house as you know, kind of world renowned as Mar Lago is in a place as public as Mar Lago is without getting the approval of President [Biden]?\"<br /><br />By not turning off the security cameras, Eric said they saw the FBI raiding areas of the property that they 'shouldn't have been.'<br />Donald Trump lamented Wednesday that the FBI blocked his lawyers from the property during the raid at his Palm Beach, Florida residence and suggested that agents may have 'planted' evidence.<br /><br />Donald Trump, meanwhile, suggested in a Wednesday post to his Truth Social page that the FBI may have planted evidence.<br />\"The FBI and others from the Federal Government would not let anyone, including my lawyers, be anywhere near the areas that were rummaged and otherwise looked at during the raid on Mar-a-Lago,\" he wrote. \"Everyone was asked to leave the premises, they wanted to be left alone, without any witnesses to see what they were doing, taking or, hopefully not, 'planting,'\" he added.<br />As the Epoch Times notes, About two dozen FBI agents entered the Trump-owned resort at 9 a.m. Monday and left with “a handful of boxes of documents,” Trump spokeswoman Christina Bobb told The Epoch Times on Tuesday. “I didn’t actually get to oversee the search, they wouldn’t let anybody see what they were doing,” she said, adding that she was present when the FBI entered the premises.<br /><br />FBI agents were looking for “what they deemed to be presidential records,” Bobb continued. “I don’t think there was anything of substance.”<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.nationandstate.com/2022/08/10/fbi-had-mole-inside-mar-a-lago-report/?amp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>nationandstate.com/2022/08/10/fbi-had-mole-in<span class=\"invisible\">side-mar-a-lago-report/?amp<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

A caucus is \"a closed meeting of a group of persons belonging to the same political party or faction usually to select candidates or to decide on policy;\" also, \"a group of people united to promote an agreed-upon cause.\" Creating TRUMP caucuses would by-pass the legalities, expense and time needed to create a third party. It would be the fastest, most effective (since it would penetrate all parties) and least expensive way to compete against and defeat the traitorous Rinos of the Republican Party and the treasonous Democrats of the Democratic Party, which together comprise that diabolical conglomerate known as the Socially Woke American Marxist Party (SWAMP). Those who voted for Trump (Trumpers) can register with the political party of their choice, but to join these caucuses and become a card-carrying TRUMPer, they would need to fill out yet another registration form and agree to whatever the TRUMP platform is. By uniting people, talents and resources under one newly-created, common, political banner (TRUMP), both money and people will be siphoned off of the SWAMP---thus draining it---which would, in particular, completely gut and financially destroy the SWAMP Rinos. Once established as local, state and national TRUMPs, each TRUMP would have ELECTION INTEGRITY as its first and most important party platform principle, for without election integrity, all voting is in vain. (As a platform principle, TRUMPers would NOT vote in areas where there is no election integrity.) In every area where election integrity is established, TRUMP candidates would be put on the ballot. If any TRUMP really wants to effect radical and rapid change, then in every area where there is no election integrity it could establish the \"no taxation without representation\" principle as part of its platform and promote and support TAX REVOLTS until election integrity has been established. These and all other platform principles would be decided by the TRUMPers themselves, as they organize themselves around America First Trumpism, defining it as they see fit. If this is something you'd like to see happen, freely join this group and help to organize caucus committees throughout the land and establish this as, essentially, a 70 to 100 million strong third party that the governing elite will have to deal with.",

No serious person believes that a documents dispute was the real purpose of the raid.

Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.) and Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), who made the push, argued that OAN and two other news channels have been spreading “misinformation” related to COVID-19, an allegation all three denied. The move prompted OAN’s attorney Eric Early to write to the lawmakers last March demanding that they publicly retract their letters.In July, Verizon announced it would drop OAN, one of three television networks favored by former President Donald Trump. In a statement at that time, Verizon said it had been “unable to reach an agreement to continue carrying One America News (OAN),” without elaborating on its reasons.Project 21 suggests the decision could lead to the removal of other news channels in the future.“Allowing a political pressure campaign to decide which news and information programs Americans have access to undermines free speech and sets a precedent that will only encourage further demands,” the group said in the letter. “This is particularly dangerous as this pressure appears to only go one way–anti-conservative and, in this case, anti-black.”“You have now projected weakness, inviting those further demands,” they added.The Epoch Times has sought comment from Verizon.",

Because they had the CCTV, they were able to watch,” Bobb told “Real America’s Voice” on Thursday.Bobb previously said she was on the premises during the raid but she and other members of Trump’s team were barred from viewing the agents’ activity. Earlier this week, meanwhile, Trump’s son Eric told the Daily Mail that agents told Mar-a-Lago staff to turn off security cameras, but they didn’t.“I was stuck in the parking lot there to collect paper and answer questions,” Bobb added. “But they were able to see the whole thing. So, they actually have a better idea of what took place inside.”It’s not clear when or if Trump’s team will release the FBI search video to the public. Reports say that Trump was not in Mar-a-Lago during the raid but was at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.Another Trump lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, told CBS News on Thursday that the former commander-in-chief is considering releasing the video and photos of the search.Speaking with Fox News Thursday, Bobb said that she “actually couldn’t accompany” the FBI agents to “see what they were opening” inside Mar-a-Lago.“We know of the stories because CCTV [and] cameras were on so those in New York watching were aware, I have to take their word for it [and] know the president put the story out,” she said.WarrantEarlier that day, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Department of Justice filed a motion to unseal a warrant and related documents. It came after a judge in the case, Bruce Reinhart, told the federal government to respond to requests to unseal it.The decision on whether to unseal the records lies with Judge Reinhart, the same judge who signed off on the search warrant. The Justice Department had until Friday afternoon to tell the judge whether Trump’s lawyers agree or disagree with the proposal to make it public.“The public’s clear and powerful interest in understanding what occurred under these circumstances weighs heavily in favor of unsealing,” said a motion filed in federal court in Florida on Thursday.Both Bobb and Trump also refuted reported claims that the FBI was searching for nuclear documents at Mar-a-Lago, with Trump writing on Truth Social that the “issue is a hoax.”“Why wouldn’t the FBI allow the inspection of areas at Mar-a-Lago with our lawyers, or others, present,” he asked.",
