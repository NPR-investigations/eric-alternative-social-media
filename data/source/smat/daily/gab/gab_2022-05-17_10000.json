It’s that simple. And New York City won’t let a group of radical extremists take away health care or any human right without a fight.”Despite calling pro-life activists “radical extremists” for wanting to protect unborn children from being killed in their mothers’ wombs, Adams seems completely unaware of the fact that a majority of Americans would consider his own beliefs “radical” and extreme.When pressed about his support for abortion up until the moment of birth, he gave the typical Democrat talking points as his answer, rather than actually talking about the issue, stating: “I think women should have the right to choose [for] their bodies. Men should not have that right to choose how a woman should treat their body.”Over 400 pro-abortion protests took place across the country on Saturday, organized by groups such as Planned Parenthood, the Women’s March, and other left-wing organizations focused on abortion. The organizers of these demonstrations threatened that the protests mark the start of a potential “summer of rage” should the Supreme Court move forward with overturning Roe v. Wade.While Democrats have begun riling up their base for the midterms over the abortion issue, raising millions of dollars following the leaking of the early opinion draft indicating the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe and return the issue to the states, a recent CNN poll indicates that the decision will likely galvanize Republicans to come out and vote in the midterms more than it will Democrats.According to the poll, 56% of GOP respondents said they were “extremely/v",

          "content": "\"In the West, even without immigration, we’re becoming mixed-race. This is not speculation, but is virtually guaranteed by the rates of intermarriage occurring in many Western countries. Projections reveal that faster immigration may slow the process by bringing in racially unmixed individuals, but in a century those of mixed-race will be the largest group in countries such as Britain and the United States. In two centuries, few people living in urban areas of the West will have an unmixed racial background. Most who do will be immigrants or members of anti-modern religious groups such as ultra-Orthodox Jews. [.....]We are entering a period of cultural instability in the West attendant on our passage between two relatively stable equilibria. The first equilibrium was based on white ethnic homogeneity, the second on what the prescient centrist writer Michael Lind calls “beige” ethnicity, i.e. a racially mixed majority group. In the middle lies a turbulent multicultural interregnum. We in the West are becoming less like homogeneous Iceland and more like homogeneous mixed-race Turkmenistan. But to get there, we’ll be passing through a phase where we’ll move closer to multicultural Guyana or Mauritius. The challenge is to enable conservative whites to see a future for themselves in whiteshift—the mixture of many non-whites into the white group through voluntary assimilation. (Unmixed whiteness is not about to disappear and may return in the long run, but this is getting ahead of the story, so I hope you’ll read on.)\" - Eric KaufmannFrom Wikipedia's early life section: \"His father Steve Kaufmann is of Jewish descent\"ESThttps://quillette.com/2019/05/24/how-can-we-manage-the-process-of-western-whiteshift/",
          "contentraw": "\"In the West, even without immigration, we’re becoming mixed-race. This is not speculation, but is virtually guaranteed by the rates of intermarriage occurring in many Western countries. Projections reveal that faster immigration may slow the process by bringing in racially unmixed individuals, but in a century those of mixed-race will be the largest group in countries such as Britain and the United States. In two centuries, few people living in urban areas of the West will have an unmixed racial background. Most who do will be immigrants or members of anti-modern religious groups such as ultra-Orthodox Jews. [.....]<br /><br />We are entering a period of cultural instability in the West attendant on our passage between two relatively stable equilibria. The first equilibrium was based on white ethnic homogeneity, the second on what the prescient centrist writer Michael Lind calls “beige” ethnicity, i.e. a racially mixed majority group. In the middle lies a turbulent multicultural interregnum. We in the West are becoming less like homogeneous Iceland and more like homogeneous mixed-race Turkmenistan. But to get there, we’ll be passing through a phase where we’ll move closer to multicultural Guyana or Mauritius. The challenge is to enable conservative whites to see a future for themselves in whiteshift—the mixture of many non-whites into the white group through voluntary assimilation.

Jeffress also served as a top aide to former Attorney General Eric Holder, while current Attorney General Merrick Garland presided over the 1999 wedding of Cooper and Jeffress.Amy JeffressIn a Wednesday Zoom call, Cooper told the parties in the case that he knew Sussmann in the 1990s when both of them worked at the DOJ.“I worked in the ’90s at the deputy attorney general’s office two years following law school. Mr. Sussmann also worked at the building at the same time in the criminal division. We did not work together or socialize, but I think it’s fair to say we were professional acquaintances,” Cooper said, per the Washington Examiner. “I don’t believe that this creates a conflict, but my regular practice is to disclose these sorts of relationships with lawyers or with parties on the record. And I would advise you that I would be happy to entertain a motion if either side believes there is a conflict on that basis or any other.”Peter Strzok and Lisa Page exchanged pro-Clinton and anti-Trump text messages while investigating both Clinton and TrumpPage, a former FBI lawyer, played a central role in the investigation of former President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to Russia – a hoax created in part by the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign and spread to the media by several operatives, including Sussmann. The FBI, meanwhile, was engaging in an alleged “media leak strategy” at the same time.So – both the judge in the Sussmann case and his wife are deeply connected within the Democratic party, and have connections to key individuals involved in the attempt to take down Donald Trump. Interestingly, Cooper was also the judge in the Benghazi ringleader case, where his wife’s ties to the DOJ posed another potential conflict of interest.",

Just days ago, Joe Biden was telling Americans in Ohio about how much he misses having dinners with segregationist senators.Biden also said during the 2020 presidential election that black Americans who voted for Trump, instead of himself, “ain’t black.”Now, in another case of hatred and intolerance, New York is in the news for its own anti-Semitism, according to American Thinker.Within the past several years, there’s been a growth of an anti-Semitic wing in the Democrat Party. Sadly, NYU Law is a part of this wing.  In its Students For Justice in Palestine chapter, NYU Law took the liberty of supporting the violent murders of 3 Israeli men. Students For Justice in Palestine decided that covering these murderers made the media “Zionist.” The NYU Law chapter even justified the murders of these individuals.Ironically, this is the same type of rhetoric to come from known anti-Semites, like former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke. Duke spread countless anti-Semitic tropes and conspiracies, just as this particular chapter from NYU Law has done.Naturally, Jewish students took offense to this. In response to comments from Students For Justice in Palestine, Jewish students accused this chapter of breaking policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment.Of course, Democrats in New York (and across America) are silent about this. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) hasn’t said a word; the same also goes for NYC Mayor Eric Adams (D).If Democrats truly cared about racism and intolerance, they’d be condemning the remarks from Students For Justice in Palestine. Instead, the political left continues to look the other way.This, if nothing else, shows the true colors of the Democrat Party. They aren’t truly opposed to bigotry or hatred; they just use these things to score political points and further their own agendas.It’s easier to accuse someone of being racist or bigoted than it is to debate them in good faith on policy issues. Thus far, Students For Justice in Palestine has not walked back its statement or apologized to the Jewish students who were offended.  At this point, it’s only a matter of time before more similar incidents emerge from the political left.",

If we have a true independent audit of all 50 states I think the people will be astonished to the level of fraud from both sides. It will explain why the GOP fights as hard as the democrats to prevent it.Example on Nov 1 2020 1PM I downloaded the states registration data showing 152,666,000 registered voters with less than 60 hours until the end of the election (That is end not beginning). This number in a very strong turn out is believable. I say that because it is very close to the 75% of people truly eligible to register. The 75% matters because as a country we have not voted over 75% since 1897.However after the counting shutdown and recounts on Nov 7 2020 when the vote count had exceeded 158 million counted ballots out of over 160 million cast ballots. I went back to the database and downloaded it again. It now shows 213,799,467 registered voters. Nov 7 2020 1PM CSTNow there are several problems. First is only 22 states have same day registration. And the new registered voter total is 61,133,467. So in less than half of the states in less than 60 hours we are expected to believe there was an additional 40% of total eligible voters nation wide registered in less than half of the country? It would be an amazing result. The problem is the 22 states together only show a 19,805,154 increase. So maybe you believe the other states were just late to update the database? Problem 2. If you do a real top down analysis of the USA population (Not just roll up all the data supplied by each state which claims we have 239 million eligible voters) You will find if you are very generous at best we have 205 million people that possibly could register to vote. Start with the USA population 331 million. Remove under 18, remove ineligible felon, remove non citizens, remove prisoner (all but 2 states), remove parolees (most states), remove Probationers (most states), add back expats. With 100% (Which could never happen) the best most generous figure is 205 million.But even at 239 million 213 million would be an unbelievable 89.36% turnout. Never once in the history of the USA since 1776 have we managed that percentage of turn out. People look into what ERIC is. They have contracts in 34 states to clean the voter databases along with special access to citizens database to help (ie. DMV, Bureau of Vital Statistic, Lexus/Nexus, AI programs to verify duplicates down to a single registration). Yet after years we still have millions of registrations that have birth dates older then the oldest living American? So what are they really doing? Because it is not cleaning the databases. I have my theories but no one will like them.",

If we have a true independent audit of all 50 states I think the people will be astonished to the level of fraud from both sides. It will explain why the GOP fights as hard as the democrats to prevent it.Example on Nov 1 2020 1PM I downloaded the states registration data showing 152,666,000 registered voters with less than 60 hours until the end of the election (That is end not beginning). This number in a very strong turn out is believable. I say that because it is very close to the 75% of people truly eligible to register. The 75% matters because as a country we have not voted over 75% since 1897.However after the counting shutdown and recounts on Nov 7 2020 when the vote count had exceeded 158 million counted ballots out of over 160 million cast ballots. I went back to the database and downloaded it again. It now shows 213,799,467 registered voters. Nov 7 2020 1PM CSTNow there are several problems. First is only 22 states have same day registration. And the new registered voter total is 61,133,467. So in less than half of the states in less than 60 hours we are expected to believe there was an additional 40% of total eligible voters nation wide registered in less than half of the country? It would be an amazing result. The problem is the 22 states together only show a 19,805,154 increase. So maybe you believe the other states were just late to update the database? Problem 2. If you do a real top down analysis of the USA population (Not just roll up all the data supplied by each state which claims we have 239 million eligible voters) You will find if you are very generous at best we have 205 million people that possibly could register to vote. Start with the USA population 331 million. Remove under 18, remove ineligible felon, remove non citizens, remove prisoner (all but 2 states), remove parolees (most states), remove Probationers (most states), add back expats. With 100% (Which could never happen) the best most generous figure is 205 million.But even at 239 million 213 million would be an unbelievable 89.36% turnout. Never once in the history of the USA since 1776 have we managed that percentage of turn out. People look into what ERIC is. They have contracts in 34 states to clean the voter databases along with special access to citizens database to help (ie. DMV, Bureau of Vital Statistic, Lexus/Nexus, AI programs to verify duplicates down to a single registration). Yet after years we still have millions of registrations that have birth dates older then the oldest living American? So what are they really doing? Because it is not cleaning the databases. I have my theories but no one will like them.",

If we have a true independent audit of all 50 states I think the people will be astonished to the level of fraud from both sides. It will explain why the GOP fights as hard as the democrats to prevent it.Example on Nov 1 2020 1PM I downloaded the states registration data showing 152,666,000 registered voters with less than 60 hours until the end of the election (That is end not beginning). This number in a very strong turn out is believable. I say that because it is very close to the 75% of people truly eligible to register. The 75% matters because as a country we have not voted over 75% since 1897.However after the counting shutdown and recounts on Nov 7 2020 when the vote count had exceeded 158 million counted ballots out of over 160 million cast ballots. I went back to the database and downloaded it again. It now shows 213,799,467 registered voters. Nov 7 2020 1PM CSTNow there are several problems. First is only 22 states have same day registration. And the new registered voter total is 61,133,467. So in less than half of the states in less than 60 hours we are expected to believe there was an additional 40% of total eligible voters nation wide registered in less than half of the country? It would be an amazing result. The problem is the 22 states together only show a 19,805,154 increase. So maybe you believe the other states were just late to update the database? Problem 2. If you do a real top down analysis of the USA population (Not just roll up all the data supplied by each state which claims we have 239 million eligible voters) You will find if you are very generous at best we have 205 million people that possibly could register to vote. Start with the USA population 331 million. Remove under 18, remove ineligible felon, remove non citizens, remove prisoner (all but 2 states), remove parolees (most states), remove Probationers (most states), add back expats. With 100% (Which could never happen) the best most generous figure is 205 million.But even at 239 million 213 million would be an unbelievable 89.36% turnout. Never once in the history of the USA since 1776 have we managed that percentage of turn out. People look into what ERIC is. They have contracts in 34 states to clean the voter databases along with special access to citizens database to help (ie. DMV, Bureau of Vital Statistic, Lexus/Nexus, AI programs to verify duplicates down to a single registration). Yet after years we still have millions of registrations that have birth dates older then the oldest living American? So what are they really doing? Because it is not cleaning the databases. I have my theories but no one will like them.",

If we have a true independent audit of all 50 states I think the people will be astonished to the level of fraud from both sides. It will explain why the GOP fights as hard as the democrats to prevent it.Example on Nov 1 2020 1PM I downloaded the states registration data showing 152,666,000 registered voters with less than 60 hours until the end of the election (That is end not beginning). This number in a very strong turn out is believable. I say that because it is very close to the 75% of people truly eligible to register. The 75% matters because as a country we have not voted over 75% since 1897.However after the counting shutdown and recounts on Nov 7 2020 when the vote count had exceeded 158 million counted ballots out of over 160 million cast ballots. I went back to the database and downloaded it again. It now shows 213,799,467 registered voters. Nov 7 2020 1PM CSTNow there are several problems. First is only 22 states have same day registration. And the new registered voter total is 61,133,467. So in less than half of the states in less than 60 hours we are expected to believe there was an additional 40% of total eligible voters nation wide registered in less than half of the country? It would be an amazing result. The problem is the 22 states together only show a 19,805,154 increase. So maybe you believe the other states were just late to update the database? Problem 2. If you do a real top down analysis of the USA population (Not just roll up all the data supplied by each state which claims we have 239 million eligible voters) You will find if you are very generous at best we have 205 million people that possibly could register to vote. Start with the USA population 331 million. Remove under 18, remove ineligible felon, remove non citizens, remove prisoner (all but 2 states), remove parolees (most states), remove Probationers (most states), add back expats. With 100% (Which could never happen) the best most generous figure is 205 million.But even at 239 million 213 million would be an unbelievable 89.36% turnout. Never once in the history of the USA since 1776 have we managed that percentage of turn out. People look into what ERIC is. They have contracts in 34 states to clean the voter databases along with special access to citizens database to help (ie. DMV, Bureau of Vital Statistic, Lexus/Nexus, AI programs to verify duplicates down to a single registration). Yet after years we still have millions of registrations that have birth dates older then the oldest living American? So what are they really doing? Because it is not cleaning the databases. I have my theories but no one will like them.",
