And here we stand - fleeing to Christ as our only hope for salvation.\"I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.\" (Psalm 73)Here we stand, on the \"Five Solas\" of the great reformation in Christian theology - the \"Reformation.\"1. Sola Scriptura - The authoritative rule for religious knowledge, faith and practice is the Bible alone (and not the traditions of any church or other religious organization).2. Sola Gratia - We - all we descendents of Adam - are sinners by nature. In ourselves, we are dead and dying - and utterly helpless and hopeless to save ourselves. We are completely dependent on God's grace alone to save us.3. Sola Fide - By His great mercy, God is pleased to save those who have faith in the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ. The instrument of our salvation is faith alone (and not our efforts or work).4. Solus Christus - It is the work of Christ alone - His perfect life of completely fulfilling the Law of God, His atoning sacrifice of death on the Cross to pay for our sins, and His resurrection from the dead to conquer death - that is the only merit and basis for our salvation.5. Soli Deo Gloria - Our salvation is completely by and from God, and God alone receives the glory for our salvation.\"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it - the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction. for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.\" (Romans 3:19-26)The purpose of this group is to promote & elucidate reformed Christian theology, and in so doing, glorify God, encourage his people, and urge sinners to flee to Christ, our only eternal hope and comfort.",

It‚Äôs totally impossible to ‚Äúearn a gift‚Äù. No ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù in false religions. One doesn‚Äôt HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn‚Äôt teach anything like either ‚Äúsalvation by works‚Äù or ‚Äúreligion‚Äù (see Romans 6:23 for more information).

No artificial anything‚Äù. (‚ÄúThe Gospel message ONLY‚Äù, in other words ‚Äì Keyword: ‚ÄúONLY‚Äù). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We‚Äôre under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, GOD THE FATHER changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren‚Äôt robots.
