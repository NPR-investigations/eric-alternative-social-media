            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

No! You don’t say?! This is a stunning flip-flop from the man who said for years that we didn’t lock down hard enough to fight COVID-19, which turned out to be like a slightly more serious version of the flu. Fauci is trying to downplay his role in what may have been one of the greatest-ever crimes against humanity.Fauci made no secret of his admiration for how the Communist Chinese Party treated its civilian population during its lockdowns. The videos of CCP police welding people’s apartment doors shut and leaving them to starve to death were like an erotic dream come true for the highest-paid bureaucrat in American history.Back in 2022, Fauci was deposed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry for the Missouri v. Biden case. They questioned Fauci for seven hours, and during that time he praised the COVID “prevention” measures that were brutally implemented in China.Fauci sent his cohort from the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Clifford Lane, to Beijing to get a first-hand look at how the CCP was cracking down on people trying to go outdoors to buy groceries. Lane was reportedly dazzled by the way the jackbooted Chinese thugs were beating and arresting civilians for not complying with stay-at-home orders, and locking people in their apartments.When Lane came back to the US, he told Fauci how great the CCP lockdowns were, and recommended similar measures for us. In his deposition about the matter, Fauci told the AGs, “Dr. Lane was very impressed about how from a clinical public health standpoint, the Chinese were handling the isolation, the contact tracing, the building of facilities to take care of people, and that’s what I believed he meant when he said were managing this in a very structured organized way.”Fauci then proceeded to push lockdowns for what felt like forever for American small business owners and children in schools. The masks, social distancing, lockdowns, distance learning in schools, a generational loss of educational attainment for American kids, businesses that failed because they weren’t allowed to reopen to full capacity, and all the rest of the human misery that resulted from Fauci’s recommendations have done unimaginable damage to our country.“Were things done too long or not?” Fauci asked during a televised performance at Georgetown University this week. “But the initial decision to lock things down, unequivocally, saved a lot of lives.”That is an impossible metric to measure. There is no possible way to know whether the lockdowns saved a single life. Whose life was saved by the lockdowns? What were their names? What evidence is there that they would have died, if Dr. Lockdown had not demanded that everything be locked down? The answer is that there is no evidence.We do, however, have evidence of the incredible social harm and suicides that resulted from Fauci’s lockdowns. The suicide for teenage girls, who faced no risk from COVID whatsoever, went up by more than 50% because of the social isolation they suffered during the lockdowns. American families lost their teenage daughters to suicide because of Fauci’s lockdowns. Unlike the “lives saved” because of lockdowns, which can’t be measured, we actually can measure the deaths that Fauci’s policies caused.Fauci is now trying to get himself off the hook by saying, “Well, gee, maybe the lockdowns went on too long.” He doesn’t want to own the responsibility for what he did or face any consequences for it.

Already, international polling simultaneously of the populations within a large number of countries so that they can be compared with one-another are consistently finding that the public’s trust of Government, and of trust in the nation’s news-media, and in the percentage of the public who believe that their Government is a democracy — all of these are higher in China than anywhere else (and far higher than in America). Unlike in all other nations, where life-expectancies rise virtually every year, America’s life-expectancies have been falling ever since 2014, and are now down to where they were in 1996.The U.S. has called Russia “a gas station with nuclear weapons”, but, for some reason, ever since Putin came into power, in the year 2000, Russia’s life-expectancies and GDP per capita have been rising not only faster than in most of the world but much faster than in America. This has continued even after the U.S. regime and its allies started applying sanctions against Russia in 2012, and then escalated them after Russia resisted America’s take-over of Ukraine in 2014. And, corruption at the very top in America is massive enough so that now there are even scientific studies which back up what former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said on 28 July 2015 when asked about the Government’s corruptness:It violates the essence of what made America a great country in its political system. Now it’s just an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or being elected president. And the same thing applies to governors, and U.S. Senators and congress members. So, now we’ve just seen a subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors, who want and expect, and sometimes get, favors for themselves after the election is over. … At the present time the incumbents, Democrats and Republicans, look upon this unlimited money as a great benefit to themselves. Somebody that is already in Congress has a great deal more to sell.On 20 December 2022, the retired U.S. politician Dennis Kucinich was interviewed about how America’s arms-makers such as Lockheed Martin came to have their lock-hold over American foreign policies, and he said that when he was in Congress the kickbacks and other corruption were totally controlling, and only few members were not bought — it’s hard to stay in Congress without being bought. There are plenty of buyable candidates for the arms-companies to fund to replace you, if you won’t cooperate. It’s the way the arms-manufacturers control their markets — which are mainly the U.S. Government, but secondarily also the U.S.-‘allied’ Governments, such as in NATO. For the buyers, it’s all about controlling their markets. That’s what political competition has now come down to, in today’s America — serving not the American people, not the voters, but the sellers to the Government.Moreover, because there is far less corruptness at the top in both Russia and China (both of which have socialized their armaments firms — which consequently are controlled by their Governments, instead of controlling their Governments), Russia’s, and also China’s, military technologies are racing ahead of those in the West, notwithstanding that America spends half of the entire world’s military expenditures — most of the U.S. expenditures are just getting skimmed off in all that corruption.These are the new realities.

          "content": "Soros-Backed St. Louis Prosecutor Sanctioned By JudgeGardner Embattled Amid New ComplaintsA St. Louis judge sanctioned St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s office last week for allegedly withholding evidence in a double-murder case, while allowing the suspect out on bond, amid rising criticism about left-wing prosecutors allowing crime to flourish in major U.S. cities.Alex Heflin, 23, was held without bond since January after he was initially charged with two counts of second-degree murder and armed criminal action, local media reported. But those charges were recently reduced to involuntary and voluntary manslaughter before he was released, while his April 17 trial has been postponed until June 12.Judge Theresa Counts Burke ruled in favor of Heflin’s lawyers after they filed a motion accusing a prosecutor under Gardner of violating discovery rules. They alleged that her office did not turn over evidence, including a 911 call recording and DNA evidence.    “The court finds that there have been repeated delays by the state in obtaining discovery and providing it to the defense,” Burke wrote, according to local reports.    “There has been a lack of diligence on the part of the state in following up and providing discovery to the defendant in a timely fashion. As a result of the state’s actions and lack of diligence, the court grants defendant’s second motion for sanctions.”Under Burke’s order, Heflin will have to remain on GPS monitoring. She also ordered the circuit attorney’s office to hand over their list of witnesses within 24 hours, provide DNA test results within 24 hours, or ask a crime lab for the DNA results.The Epoch Times has contacted Gardner’s office for comment.In a statement, Gardner said that it is working with police “to bring justice on behalf of the people of the City of St. Louis, victims, and their families.” It added that her office “is dedicated to doing everything in its power to hold the defendant accountable … and will continue to work to ensure justice is served.While the St. Louis Police Department did not comment on the case and said it is working with Garnder’s office, the St. Louis Police Officers’ Association accused Gardner of misconduct.    “The St. Louis Police Officers’ Association would like to address the unfounded claims made against our members in a recent news article concerning State vs. Heflin. Kim Gardner’s office has once again failed to accept responsibility for the mistakes made within her office and chose instead to blame the hard-working men and women of the St. Louis Police Department,” the statement said.    “These repeated problems are due to the incompetence of the Circuit Attorney’s office, not from the actions of police officers.”The union added that “in this case, all the evidence had been turned over to the Circuit Attorney’s office for nearly a year prior to trial. Police officers shouldn’t be made scapegoats for an overworked, backlogged, and mismanaged Circuit Attorney’s Office.”It comes days after Gardner, a Democrat, said she will run for reelection in 2024 – even as she tries to fend off an effort by Missouri’s attorney general to force her out of office. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February filed a lawsuit asking a judge to remove Gardner from office, accusing her of incompetence.Bailey cited a low rate of convictions in homicide cases, accused Gardner of failing to keep crime victims and their families updated, and said her office is too slow to take up cases brought by police.Republicans have accused her of receiving money from groups tied to left-wing billionaire financier George Soros, who was accused of providing funding to left-wing groups during the Black Lives Matter-related unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, nearly 10 years ago. In 2016, she received campaign funding from Soros’s Safety and Justice Committee, according to the Missouri Times, while in 2017, she worked with The Vera Institute of Justice, which itself received $11 million from Soros’s Open Society Foundations, it was reported.Soros has been accused of providing funding to other left-wing district attorneys, which was highlighted by tech billionaire Elon Musk last month.    “Soros figured out a clever arbitrage opportunity: The many small political contests, such as DAs &amp; judges, have much higher impact per dollar spent than the big races, so it is far easier to sway the outcome,” he wrote in response to claims that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg received Soros cash.In 2018, the Supreme Court of Missouri ordered Gardner to be disciplined for misconduct in the 2018 prosecution of then-Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican.https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/soros-backed-st-louis-prosecutor-sanctioned-by-judge/",

Sources in General Eric M. Smith’s office have put the number of “5th Columnists” at about 500, a figure the whistleblower confirmed. They have sworn to help White Hats topple the criminal Biden regime and its corrupt Dept. of Justice.Christopher Wray, though, discovered that agents under his command were working alongside White Hats to subvert his authority, but he had no idea which agents were sharing his sinister agenda—to deprive Americans of the rights and freedoms they hold dear—with the White Hat community. The search for double agents sent a paranoid Wray plummeting headfirst down a conspiratorial rabbit hole filled with real and imagined plots to oust him from the FBI. The whistleblower said that Wray’s eternal quest to find “Trump-supporting traitors” drove him mad.In January Wray tasked group supervisors and special agents in charge in D.C., Spokane, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Oklahoma City, New York City, and Miami with ferreting out “5th Columnists,” giving them three weeks to produce a list of names. When three weeks elapsed and the supervisors and agents in charge hadn’t uncovered even a single “5th columnist,” Wray went bonkers and accused them of being spies, demanding they take polygraphs to prove they were not counterintelligence agents secretly working for Donald Trump and General Smith. They all passed, and Wray’s insanity soared to new heights; he saw spies everywhere and plots hatching around him.“It’s gotten to the point Chris Wray trusts no one; even his immediate subordinates are suspect in his eyes. If I say he’s batshit crazy, it’s an understatement. He’s used thousands of man-hours and a lot of taxpayer dollars trying without luck to figure out who we are,” the whistleblower said.Wray’s frenetic lunacy continued into February when he demoted a deputy agent in charge for insubordination and a made-up infraction: failure to address him as “sir” when in the presence of Cabinet members or high-ranking military officials.“Sometime near the end of February, and I don’t remember the date, Chris Wray—and by then he’s totally humiliated he couldn’t find any of us—meets with Lloyd Austin, a real piece of work, and brings a tenured FBI agent in charge with him. And this guy, and I don’t want to name him, has been in the Bureau for 15 years. And right in front of Austin, Wray just starts chewing this guy a new ass hole, saying he’s the reason the Bureau can’t find us. And this poor sap is just a guy who’s been doing his job. Chris Wray is dressing him down and telling Austin how he’s demoting him to desk work. And I know this because Wray bragged about it, and the special agent in charge became a pencil pusher,” the whistleblower said.Wray, he added, hid his shame by blaming others for his failures. During his meeting with Austin, Wray suggested that the FBI join Austin’s military to expose and eradicate White Hat “insurrectionists,” a label he applied to dissident agents and anyone else opposing the criminal Biden regime. He told Austin he distrusted his people and wanted soldiers to help “capture or kill” insurrectionists, and he specifically requested Special Forces fill that role. Austin was forced to admit that he no longer controlled Special Forces but offered a different solution: He said “a Biden buddy” at the USAF’s Close Precision Engagement Team would abide by his commands.Wray, the whistleblower said, chose 75 agents to work beside Austin’s 50-man unit, but in his haste to expose his enemies, wound up picking a few “5th Columnists” to attend the joint FBI-Black Hat task force, and they relayed intel to Gen. Smith’s office.The joint force trained for 60 days at the FBI’s headquarters in Quantico and at Black Hat-controlled Travis AFB, California, where they practiced marksmanship skills on range targets using President Trump and General Smith’s face in place of a bullseye. They performed insurgency drills and mock interrogations and were taught to regard all Trump supporters with suspicion.Meanwhile, Wray wrote list after list of potential offenders. He scoured the social media profiles of hundreds of agents—active and retired—for indicators of treasonous behavior, such as badmouthing Biden or espousing support for President Trump, execrable crimes, according to Wray.",
