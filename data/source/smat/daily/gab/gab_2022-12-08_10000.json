The Dutch national team has not even faced off against Morocco yet, but fans in the country battle with riot police in Amsterdam, just as they did after Morocco‚Äôs victory over Belgium.The Hague also saw chaos on the streets, with fans attacking police vehicles in the Schilderswijk neighborhood.In France, the city of Lille saw Moroccan fans starting fires and attacking police with fireworks. Riot police responded by charging the revelers in an attempt to disperse them and restore calm.Fans in the French city of Nice also fired pistols into the air, blocked streets, and terrorized residents.‚ÄúAre we still in France? Tram blocked and rocked, police attacked and cars burned. This is the result of Morocco‚Äôs victory in the streets of Nice! Zero tolerance against these criminals who defy our laws!‚Äù wrote Les Republicans politician and former presidential candidate Eric Cotti on Twitter.Brussels, the capital of Belgium, was also hit with mass riots following Morocco‚Äôs victory over Spain, with fans attacking police vehicles. Belgium has one of the largest Moroccan populations in Europe, numbering over 500,000 in a country of 11.5 million.As Remix News previously reported, Belgium and the Netherlands were hit by widespread riots following Morocco‚Äôs victory last month.",

The Dutch national team has not even faced off against Morocco yet, but fans in the country battle with riot police in Amsterdam, just as they did after Morocco‚Äôs victory over Belgium.The Hague also saw chaos on the streets, with fans attacking police vehicles in the Schilderswijk neighborhood.In France, the city of Lille saw Moroccan fans starting fires and attacking police with fireworks. Riot police responded by charging the revelers in an attempt to disperse them and restore calm.Fans in the French city of Nice also fired pistols into the air, blocked streets, and terrorized residents.‚ÄúAre we still in France? Tram blocked and rocked, police attacked and cars burned. This is the result of Morocco‚Äôs victory in the streets of Nice! Zero tolerance against these criminals who defy our laws!‚Äù wrote Les Republicans politician and former presidential candidate Eric Cotti on Twitter.Brussels, the capital of Belgium, was also hit with mass riots following Morocco‚Äôs victory over Spain, with fans attacking police vehicles.
