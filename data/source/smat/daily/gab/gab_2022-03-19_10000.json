I do both data analysis at the global level, and study the human mind. How the mind makes associations, and how those associations affect behavior. I can tell you there is a simple reason it is so difficult to get your legislators from either party interested in independent audits. They know the fraud exists. They know the fraud happens from both parties.Now I can not speak for the validity of what this woman is telling us. But notice the lack of enthusiasm she gets as a response. All auditors receive this same level of non enthusiastic involvement from the vast majority of legislators. I started with a top down analysis of the 2020 election on Nov 7 2020. The USA population can not support the 213 million registered voters listed on that date. I have since progressed to helping with state audits looking at real data.I can not speak for states that do not use (ERIC) Electronic Registration Information Center. But for the states that do. I ask a simple question. What does ERIC actually do to clean the voter rolls. They have access I was very surprised to find out about. They have access to the voter registration databases. Access to the DMV. Access to the Bureau of Vital Statistics. That should make them very efficient at cleaning the voter rolls. Especially when combined with other accesses that the average person is able to attain. You would expect after investing tons of tax payer dollars and all this special access. That the voter registration rolls should be so clean it is difficult to identify bad voter registration data. Yet within a few seconds of viewing the data any one can see bad data? How can that be? Unless ERIC is not really focused on cleaning the data? Could it be they are focused on adding un-registered voters instead? Or worse? All I am saying is hypothetically with the access ERIC has for a period of 6 months. (Time to write and test scripts to create registrations with real data. Extracted from the DMV and Bureau of Vital Statistics)(Time to write and test scripts to create ballots for registered voters). If you add admin access to the actual election voting databases live. Give me back my global programmer teams. With a delay of 3-4 hours on election night (Time run scripts to create ballots  for newly registered voters and those that had not voted yet). I could hand you what ever election winner you wanted. Later if you review the data it will all appear to be 100% legitimate. Even better then the actual election data I am looking at. The absolute only way you would be able to find the fraud. Would be to canvas and ask the actual voters if they minded discussing their cast votes. https://rumble.com/vxil0v-maria-zacks-earth-shattering-testimony-kansas-senate-hearing.html",

          "contentraw": "I know most of the conservatives on this site believe the Democrats produced fraud in the 2020 election. <br />As a person with a rather unique set of skills. I do both data analysis at the global level, and study the human mind. How the mind makes associations, and how those associations affect behavior. <br />I can tell you there is a simple reason it is so difficult to get your legislators from either party interested in independent audits. <br />They know the fraud exists. They know the fraud happens from both parties.<br />Now I can not speak for the validity of what this woman is telling us. But notice the lack of enthusiasm she gets as a response. All auditors receive this same level of non enthusiastic involvement from the vast majority of legislators. <br />I started with a top down analysis of the 2020 election on Nov 7 2020. The USA population can not support the 213 million registered voters listed on that date. <br />I have since progressed to helping with state audits looking at real data.<br />I can not speak for states that do not use (ERIC) Electronic Registration Information Center. But for the states that do. I ask a simple question. What does ERIC actually do to clean the voter rolls. They have access I was very surprised to find out about. They have access to the voter registration databases. Access to the DMV. Access to the Bureau of Vital Statistics. That should make them very efficient at cleaning the voter rolls. Especially when combined with other accesses that the average person is able to attain. You would expect after investing tons of tax payer dollars and all this special access. That the voter registration rolls should be so clean it is difficult to identify bad voter registration data. Yet within a few seconds of viewing the data any one can see bad data? How can that be? Unless ERIC is not really focused on cleaning the data? Could it be they are focused on adding un-registered voters instead? <br />Or worse? <br />All I am saying is hypothetically with the access ERIC has for a period of 6 months. (Time to write and test scripts to create registrations with real data. Extracted from the DMV and Bureau of Vital Statistics)(Time to write and test scripts to create ballots for registered voters). <br />If you add admin access to the actual election voting databases live. Give me back my global programmer teams. With a delay of 3-4 hours on election night (Time run scripts to create ballots  for newly registered voters and those that had not voted yet). I could hand you what ever election winner you wanted. Later if you review the data it will all appear to be 100% legitimate. Even better then the actual election data I am looking at. The absolute only way you would be able to find the fraud. Would be to canvas and ask the actual voters if they minded discussing their cast votes. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://rumble.com/vxil0v-maria-zacks-earth-shattering-testimony-kansas-senate-hearing.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>rumble.com/vxil0v-maria-zacks-earth-shatterin<span class=\"invisible\">g-testimony-kansas-senate-hearing.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

So after the run up right, early ‚Äò74, the punchline is that for almost 30 years, oil traded between roughly $12 to $15 a barrel and about $30 a barrel. And when oil got to $30, the Americans were raising rates and tightening policy. And when oil got down to the low end of that range, the Americans were loosening policy via fed funds.\"  <br /><br />\"So dollar goes from being pegged to gold to being pseudo pegged to oil 2005, we reach a point where between the rise of China and the geological realities that were beginning to hit in global oil fields. In short peak cheap oil, you were starting to see a number of the world‚Äôs great oil fields, start to reach peak levels and start to roll over.\"  <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.grant-williams.com/podcast/0028-luke-gromen/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>grant-williams.com/podcast/0028-luke-gromen/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

The SAR also pointed to allegations of Youssef being tied to Syrian General Maher al-Assad, the brother of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. According to the OCCRP, suspicious activity reports, or SARs, \"are secret alerts issued by bank compliance officers when there are suspicions that a transaction may be linked to crime or money laundering.

The SAR also pointed to allegations of Youssef being tied to Syrian General Maher al-Assad, the brother of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. <br /><br />According to the OCCRP, suspicious activity reports, or SARs, \"are secret alerts issued by bank compliance officers when there are suspicions that a transaction may be linked to crime or money laundering.

Credit: ¬© 2022 Jiang et al.Originally published in Journal of Experimental Medicine.https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20210739Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), have discovered that cells carrying the most common mutation found in human cancer accumulate large amounts of ferrous iron and that this ‚Äúferroaddiction‚Äù can be exploited to specifically deliver powerful anticancer drugs without harming normal, healthy cells. The therapeutic strategy, described in a study that was published on March 9, 2022, in the Journal of Experimental Medicine (JEM), could be used to treat a wide variety of cancers driven by mutations in the KRAS gene.Mutations in KRAS are found in many cancers and are particularly common in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), colorectal cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and lung adenocarcinoma. In total, KRAS mutations are thought to cause a quarter of all cancer deaths by activating cell signaling pathways that drive cell proliferation and enhance cell survival. These signaling pathways can be blocked by drugs that inhibit some of the proteins activated by KRAS, but, in addition to killing cancer cells, these drugs are highly toxic to healthy cells and tissues, limiting their use at doses needed to inhibit signaling in cancer cells.‚ÄúFor example, inhibitors of the MEK1/2 enzymes have shown clinical benefit, but the approach suffers from dose-limiting toxicities in the eye, skin, gut, and other organs,‚Äù explains Eric A. Collisson, MD, a professor in the Department of Medicine at UCSF. ‚ÄúClinical experience has shown that sustainable dosing of these inhibitors is often well below FDA-approved dose, severely hampering the dose intensity achievable in the tumor cell and ultimately limiting clinical efficacy.‚ÄùIn the new JEM study, first author Honglin Jiang and colleagues develop a method to target MEK inhibitors, and potentially other anticancer agents, to KRAS-driven tumors without harming other, healthy tissues in the body.The researchers discovered that a wide variety of KRAS-driven tumors show increased activity of genes involved in iron uptake and metabolism, and, in PDA, this increase in gene activity correlated with shorter survival times. PET scans of PDA patients showed that their tumors accumulated high levels of iron. Jiang and colleagues wondered whether this addiction to iron might provide a way to target these cancer cells more precisely.",

All federal judges‚Äîand all federal judges are presumably committed to free speech‚Äîshould carefully consider whether any student so identified should be disqualified from potential clerkships.\"The email set off a flurry of replies from Silberman's colleagues, several of whom expressed interest in discussing the matter further.\"I don't know where I come out on this yet,\" District Judge Eric Komitee of the Eastern District of New York wrote, \"but agree this is a topic of tremendous societal importance.\"The emails come amid revelations that the protest was even more disruptive than initially reported. According to Original Jurisdiction‚Äòs David Lat, students in a federal courts class across the hall reported that the \"floor was shaking,\" and students on a different floor could hear the din while they were taking an exam.The law school also had to move a faculty meeting online because attendees couldn't hear anything over the tumult. Faculty at the meeting kept looking to Heather Gerken, the Dean of Yale Law School, to confront the protesters, according to Lat, but she did nothing.After news of the protest broke, the law school released a statement on Thursday alleging that police were only \"on hand\" to ensure that the protesters quieted down, not to protect the safety of panelists. \"Fortunately,\" the statement claims, police \"assistance was not needed and the event went forward until its conclusion.\"But audio from the panel indicates it was drowned out at several points by the protesters, whose chants went on for more than 10 minutes. The din drowns out Kristen Waggoner, the general counsel of the Alliance Defending Freedom, right as she begins speaking, and chants of \"protect trans kids\" make it extremely difficult to hear the panel for several minutes.The audio also suggests that Yale police officers escorted the panelists to a patrol car outside out of concern for their safety‚Äîcontradicting Yale's claim that the police only came to ensure the protesters quieted down.",

Deborah Ross (N.C.), Adam Schiff (Calif.), Ruben Gallego (Ariz.) and Terri Sewell (Ala.) led the letter, which was also signed by Democratic Reps.
