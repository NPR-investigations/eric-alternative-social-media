He explained how elections can be very close and how leaving all of these ineligible voters on the voter rolls can lead to stolen elections. The Thomas More lawyer explained how Registers in Probate in 13 counties in WI have fought back against the motion by the Thomas More Law Society to request a form that contains PUBLIC information that would reveal how many residents are under guardianship orders. Kaardal explained that they claim it&#39;s &quot;private&quot; information. He asked the WI legislature, &quot;Why can&#39;t we get a form from the Register in Probate that&#39;s sent to the WI Election Commission that that information is then put into the WISC vote database, and meant for the public to know &#39;That person is ineligible to vote?&#39;&quot;Finally, Kaardal explains that WI Election Commission won&#39;t do anything to update their database, &quot;Because once they update the database, we will see that they all voted.&quot; He jokingly called the reason the data was being hidden from the public  &quot;The 800-pound elephant in the room.&quot;",
