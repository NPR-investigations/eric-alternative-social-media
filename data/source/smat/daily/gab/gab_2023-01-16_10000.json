Hebrews 1:1-4 is BEYOND self-explanatory that there are simply no prophets today...PERIOD. Feel free to examine it. There are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. The Old Testament prophets existed to point the way to Jesus. Simply the fact that there is a “prophetic” posting in a public setting and not in a church setting these days is tell-tale in itself that it’s NOT a prophetic word. This is the A.D. Era now.Anyone reading this, do yourself a HUGE favor and R-U-N...FAST.Those aren’t prophets.There are no apostles today.

Before his conversion on the Damascus Road, the apostle Paul was known as Saul of Tarsus.  James comes to mind. Simon Peter comes to mind. John comes to mind. Paul comes to mind. Jesus ascended into Heaven CENTURIES ago. There’s a big difference between an apostle and a disciple. 100% of everyone born again is a disciple. One fancy phrase for a disciple would be, “...a student of...” After that would come human servants. Those can be read about in 1 Corinthians 3:5-9, Ephesians 4:11-16 and so on. Someone who conducts a regular Bible study would be more of a teacher. Someone who penned a portion of The Bible would be called an apostle.According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them and according to 1 John 4:1, instructions are to test the spirits. In the case of “S8W”, it’s, “Fail,” and, “Fail,” respectively. Meanwhile, forever’s a long time. Praying those involved get it figured out in time! Spooky. The belief system is that this “Eric von Anderseck” clown proclaims himself to be the “Apostle to North America”. In other words, unless he’s the one “hearing from The Lord for you”, you’re not hearing from The Lord.",

They start looking for a safe, new home and during their adventures they come across another rabbit mound called Cowslip. There, all the rabbits are unusually large, friendly and seemingly well-fed. For a moment, the Sandleford rabbits think they've found a safe haven, writes Mark E. Jeftovic .There's just one problem: every so often one of the rabbits goes missing. It turns out that the entire rabbit hill is on a farmer's land, who feeds and cares for them, but sets snares and traps for their pelts from time to time.There's only one rule in Cowslip's Warren: no one is allowed to ask questions or talk about the missing rabbits.I want anyone reading this to come up with two numbers by asking you two questions:Question #1) How many people do you know who have died of COVID?I first heard rumors of a new Coronavirus from China in January 2020 (although it now appears that COVID was already circulating around the world in mid-2019).When I got wind of it, I emailed friends and colleagues to get N95 masks and stock up on groceries and medicine. It looked bad. In February, I was probably one of the first people in town to wear an N95 mask. In March, I started making a spreadsheet with R0, death rates, and doubling times coming from the CDC, WHO, and screaming hysterics like Eric Feigl-Ding:The famous “HMOG Tweet”.The screen grab above is the famous “Holy Mother Of God” tweet, which is sometimes speculated to have sounded the bell for the global COVID panic. Feigl-Ding himself calls it a crucial moment, and he has since deleted the tweet. This is archived here .It's still working btw...When it all happened, I was scared at first. My rough model predicted that by the end of May we would have 442,368 cases with a whopping 22,118 fatalities, and that was just in Toronto. At the end of July, there were 1.7 million cases and 88,473 deaths.I've explained before what happened and what made me a skeptic : Every day I added the new numbers of cases and deaths from the city, county, and federal government. By the fall, I knew that the number of cases was nonsense (it didn't matter how many people tested positive on a PCR test) and that lockdowns were a bigger problem than the virus.There wouldn't be 88,000 deaths nationwide, let alone Toronto (the official death toll for all of Canada is now 49,500 - and we also now know that most of those, over 90%, were with COVID and not from COVID. Toronto had about 3,700 total deaths in over two years).I naively thought this was good news. Surely everyone was looking at the data and surely everyone could see by mid-summer that, even adjusted for seasonality and assuming a new wave in the fall, this was nowhere near the THERMONUCLEAR EVENT that some analysts were promoting.We all know what happened instead: By the fall, it had become a full-fledged religion and well on its way to mass-forming psychosis.But in the early days, when things looked really bad, I thought it meant we would probably hear about once a week that someone in our extended family, circle of friends, or co-workers was going to die from this. Ditto for celebrities, the evening news would be flooded with odes and tributes to notable people who had just been felled by COVID. Perhaps one or more of my close relatives would die from this. Maybe I do. It was frightening.From our vantage point here in early 2023, I can think of only three celebs who died with COVID: John Prine, Herman Cain, and much to the delight of the zerocovid madmen: Meatloaf.On January 1, 2022, I suspected the pandemic was mostly over . During the main period of COVID, I lost about four people within my social circle, none to COVID or even to COVID. That figure does not include the two other people close to me who I knew committed suicide during the lockdowns.So without prejudice to the tragedy of those 49,000 Canadians who have succumbed to COVID, my figure for the first question is zero.Question #2) How many people do you know who have died “suddenly and unexpectedly” in the past 18 months?Recall how I expected to hear at least once a week about relatives, acquaintances and colleagues who had died of COVID, but heard nothing.However, when it comes to family members, friends and acquaintances who have died suddenly and unexpectedly from a heart attack or other unexpected medical event, in the past year to 18 months or so…well, that's a different story.Read morehttps://www.frontnieuws.com/ze-beloofden-veilig-en-effectief-we-kregen-plotseling-en-onverwacht/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=notification&amp;utm_id=812096",
