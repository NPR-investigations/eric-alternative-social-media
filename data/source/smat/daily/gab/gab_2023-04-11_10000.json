            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

            "description_html": "<p>WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they&#39;re Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov&#39;t education. Let&#39;s examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We&#39;ve shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it&#39;s an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. &quot;Antarctic Treaty&quot; prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We&#39;re at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you&#39;re no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false &quot;echo chamber&quot; stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.<\/p>",

From David Crosby Cause Of Death Revealed9 April 2023\"While many older rockers like Van Morrison and Eric Clapton took public anti-vax stances, David Crosby was one of the staunchest supporters of vaccination, taking legal action against Robert F Kennedy's Children's Health Defence Movement's unauthorised use of his music at a rally.

This alone should invalidate the bogus “crimes” against President Trump.President Trump built a huge business before ever running for president in 2016.  He was a multi-billionaire with numerous businesses in his organization.After President Trump won the 2016 election beating corrupt Hillary Clinton, and before his inauguration, President Trump signed a trust to put his businesses in and gave control of the trust to his sons, Eric and Don Jr.  This was a generous move that he didn’t have to take but he wanted to remove any conflicts of interest while he was President.The BBC reported at the time:US President-elect Donald Trump says he is handing over his business empire to his sons, Donald Jr and Eric.He told a news conference he had formally given “complete and total” control to them in a bid to avoid conflicts of interest.Mr Trump’s lawyer, Sheri Dillon said the President-elect had “isolated” himself from his businesses…… Speaking at Mr Trump’s first news conference since he was elected in November, Ms Dillon explained that all of the Trump Organization’s businesses would be transferred to a trust controlled by his sons and the chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, before Mr Trump takes power on 20 January.“Together, Don, Eric, and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump,” said Ms Dillon, whose firm Morgan, Lewis and Bockius has been instructed by Mr Trump to draw up a structure to keep his business interests separate.Ms Dillon added that an ethics adviser would be appointed to the management board of the trust to oversee any potential conflicts of interest.This past week, the corrupt Soros-backed DA in Manhattan and he Trump-hating gang of former Obama White House and Biden DOJ members, dropped a BS indictment against President Trump.  These people have no love for President Trump and no respect for the rule of law in the land.  If they did, they never would have put together this BS piece of work.The indictment is BS for many reasons but one of the major reasons surrounds the charges themselves.  Bragg and his gang believe that the accounting activities itemized in the indictment are crimes.  But the activities all occurred after President Trump handed his multi-billion dollar organization over to the control of his sons.   Below is the filing with the court where the corrupt Soros-backed DA Bragg claims that President Trump “made and caused a false entry in the business records of an enterprise”.President Trump had nothing to do with these entries in his multi-billion dollar company.  This is lunacy.None of these activities are crimes in the first place.What a crock.https://www.scribd.com/document/636106480/Donald-J-Trump-Indictment#download&amp;from_embedThe idea that President Trump, the head of a multi-billion dollar entity had anything to do with the accounting entries in his organization is lunacy.  He never did and never will have anything to do with accounting entries in his organization.  That’s what accountants are for.President Trump was not running his companies at the time of these events.  He had handed it over to the control of his sons.President Trump is not an accountant and the Soros-backed and Obama/Biden-connected attorneys behind this case are not objective and fair-minded prosecutors and they certainly aren’t accountants either.These people after President Trump are criminals involved in a conspiracy to overthrow our nation and interfere in the last and the next election. https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/04/the-timing-of-events-in-soros-backed-da-bragg-indictment-of-president-trump-invalidate-the-entire-case",

He was a multi-billionaire with numerous businesses in his organization.<br /><br />After President Trump won the 2016 election beating corrupt Hillary Clinton, and before his inauguration, President Trump signed a trust to put his businesses in and gave control of the trust to his sons, Eric and Don Jr.  This was a generous move that he didn’t have to take but he wanted to remove any conflicts of interest while he was President.<br /><br />The BBC reported at the time:<br /><br />US President-elect Donald Trump says he is handing over his business empire to his sons, Donald Jr and Eric.<br /><br />He told a news conference he had formally given “complete and total” control to them in a bid to avoid conflicts of interest.<br /><br />Mr Trump’s lawyer, Sheri Dillon said the President-elect had “isolated” himself from his businesses…<br /><br />… Speaking at Mr Trump’s first news conference since he was elected in November, Ms Dillon explained that all of the Trump Organization’s businesses would be transferred to a trust controlled by his sons and the chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, before Mr Trump takes power on 20 January.<br /><br />“Together, Don, Eric, and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump,” said Ms Dillon, whose firm Morgan, Lewis and Bockius has been instructed by Mr Trump to draw up a structure to keep his business interests separate.<br /><br />Ms Dillon added that an ethics adviser would be appointed to the management board of the trust to oversee any potential conflicts of interest.<br /><br />This past week, the corrupt Soros-backed DA in Manhattan and he Trump-hating gang of former Obama White House and Biden DOJ members, dropped a BS indictment against President Trump.  These people have no love for President Trump and no respect for the rule of law in the land.  If they did, they never would have put together this BS piece of work.<br /><br />The indictment is BS for many reasons but one of the major reasons surrounds the charges themselves.  Bragg and his gang believe that the accounting activities itemized in the indictment are crimes.  But the activities all occurred after President Trump handed his multi-billion dollar organization over to the control of his sons.   <br /><br />Below is the filing with the court where the corrupt Soros-backed DA Bragg claims that President Trump “made and caused a false entry in the business records of an enterprise”.<br /><br />President Trump had nothing to do with these entries in his multi-billion dollar company.  This is lunacy.<br /><br />None of these activities are crimes in the first place.<br /><br />What a crock.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/636106480/Donald-J-Trump-Indictment#download&amp;from_embed\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>scribd.com/document/636106480/Donald-J-Trump-<span class=\"invisible\">Indictment#download&amp;from_embed<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The idea that President Trump, the head of a multi-billion dollar entity had anything to do with the accounting entries in his organization is lunacy.  He never did and never will have anything to do with accounting entries in his organization.  That’s what accountants are for.<br /><br />President Trump was not running his companies at the time of these events.  He had handed it over to the control of his sons.<br /><br />President Trump is not an accountant and the Soros-backed and Obama/Biden-connected attorneys behind this case are not objective and fair-minded prosecutors and they certainly aren’t accountants either.<br /><br />These people after President Trump are criminals involved in a conspiracy to overthrow our nation and interfere in the last and the next election. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/04/the-timing-of-events-in-soros-backed-da-bragg-indictment-of-president-trump-invalidate-the-entire-case\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2023/04/the-timing-of-ev<span class=\"invisible\">ents-in-soros-backed-da-bragg-indictment-of-president-trump-invalidate-the-entire-case<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Excellent resource.Dr Eric Berg explains how Vitamin D affects all Human organs and tissue.It's more of a hormone than a vitamin and we can't be without it.Many people are deficient in Vitamin D (you can get tested for that and B12,another very important vitamin).Considering Vaccine injuries, 5G, Chemtrails, GMO,Flouride and more we need to make sure we have ample amounts of Vitamin D to help us stay healthy.Vitamin K2 taken in conjunction with D3 is said to help its absorption.From Columbia UniversityYou probably know vitamin D is important. It’s vital to bone health, muscle movement, nerve connections to the brain, and immune system function.  Studies suggest vitamin D also may help protect us from infections (including COVID) and major diseases like cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes, and dementia. Because it’s often in the news and is available on store shelves, vitamin D seems like an easy way to bolster your health. But is it? Endocrinologist John Bilezikian, MD, answered common questions about vitamin D to explain what it can and cannot do.What is vitamin D? Vitamin D, like all vitamins, is a nutrient that’s essential for life. Our bodies produce active vitamin D after exposure to sunlight, and we get some vitamin D from food.Vitamin D is also a hormone. Hormones help control how cells and organs function. However, we do not call vitamin D “hormone D” because without it we cannot live. Latin lesson: vita means life. Vitamins D3 v. D2 Two forms of vitamin D are available in supplements: vitamin D3 and vitamin D2. Both can help correct vitamin D deficiency, but most doctors recommend D3 because it is slightly more active and therefore slightly more effective. Vitamin D3 is naturally produced by animals, including humans. Vitamin D2 is the plant form. Using the form made in our bodies is another reason for recommending vitamin D3.  What does vitamin D do? Vitamin D makes our bodies better at absorbing other nutrients, namely calcium and phosphorus, both important for bone health. Vitamin D also helps to restore and maintain the calcium in our bones, where 99% of it resides. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become weak and fragile.  Some studies show a possible connection between vitamin D and protection against cancer, heart disease, bacterial and viral infections, COVID, and more. But more research is needed to substantiate these links.  https://www.cuimc.columbia. edu/news/whats-deal-vitamin-d",

Using the form made in our bodies is another reason for recommending vitamin D3.  <br /><br />What does vitamin D do? <br />Vitamin D makes our bodies better at absorbing other nutrients, namely calcium and phosphorus, both important for bone health. Vitamin D also helps to restore and maintain the calcium in our bones, where 99% of it resides. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become weak and fragile.  <br /><br />Some studies show a possible connection between vitamin D and protection against cancer, heart disease, bacterial and viral infections, COVID, and more. But more research is needed to substantiate these links.  <br /><br />https://www.cuimc.columbia. edu/news/whats-deal-vitamin-d",

When other countries do this, we send in Jimmy Carter and organize a color revolution to throw out the corrupt and tyrannical government. In America, the ruling class makes excuses, and the opposition party says little.A rogue and compromised D.A. accuses a former, remarkable, president of covering up non-existent crimes and the media claps like seals at “upholding democracy” while Republicans mutter about “letting the process play out.” Republicans bring a nerf gun to a real gun fight and wonder why they lose.An FEC commissioner asserted about Trump’s supposed crimes, “It’s not a campaign finance violation. It’s not a reporting violation of any kind. In a banana republic, those in charge define crimes, and it is situational, applying only to Trump and not Clinton or Biden.”Riots in the summer of 2020, “the summer of love” were cheered on by Demoorhoids and the media.  Some Republicans like Sen. Mitt Romney marched in solidarity with the rioters. There were few arrests or prosecutions, even as cities and businesses were destroyed, yet mostly peaceful protesters, aside from those antagonised by police, at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, were bashed and incarcerated by the hundreds for long periods without due process.Protest outside an abortion clinic and you get arrested. Protest outside the home of, and threaten a U.S. Supreme Court justice, and law enforcement stands down.One president, a Demoorhoid, while a senator and vice president, improperly and carelessly, without presidential authority, stored classified documents and was given a pass. Another president, a Republican, with full declassification authority, stored declassified documents under lock and key and Secret Service protection, and his home was raided by the FBI and now a special counsel is conjuring up a crime to charge the former president with.A two-tiered justice system is the new norm with the ruling class making laws on the go, to suit their needs and ambitions. Is this the Soviet Union or East Germany? No, it is, or at least was, the United States of America. Is it time to panic?Will the hapless GOP fight back or simply send out more fundraising letters and emails? Are there any Republican DA’s or attorneys general with the cojones to convene a grand jury and indict Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, the Biden family, or Nancy Pelosi? Fat chance. This is the only way to fight back but the current GOP prefers taking the high road to irrelevancy.The ruling class elites, regardless of political party, protect their own. As Trump has a double-digit lead over his presumed GOP establishment primary opponents, expect the tyrannical attacks to continue. If Trump wins the GOP nomination, every Democrat D.A. or A.G. will indict Trump for anything, tying up his campaign in court.This is what’s called “lawfare,” the new Demoorhoid blood sport where anything goes while Republicans play by Marquis of Queensbury rules and, not surprisingly, continue to be punched in the nose and lose the fight. One might ask, why vote Republican?Why is Trump, now a private citizen, attacked, and not Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson, or any other potential GOP candidate? That should speak volumes. The left fears Trump far more than they fear any other candidate who can be bought, manipulated, and will follow the “big club” rules, unlike Trump, who is the only one seriously fighting the ruling class (drain the swamp) corruption.But if Trump is taken down, who is left to continue this fight? At this point there is no fighter on par with Trump, else the elites and administrative state would be attacking that person.Given the state of the country and attacks on the best person to restore American greatness, Rush Limbaugh’s question of “Is it time to panic?” is more relevant today than at any time in recent history.Yes folks, it is time to panic, but in a quiet, reserved, and resourceful way. Controlled, clinical panic can be a ferocious and unstoppable adversary. The GOP, other than pay a bit of lip service, won’t do what is required, and that leaves President Trump and us. Don’t let him try to do it on his own. They will ultimately break him, or worse, attempt to “take him out.” Don’t underestimate them – they will.From hereon in, folks it must be complete solidarity, Trump, and us, locked tightly together, and wholesomely united in the MAGA movement. No mistakes, no missteps, no mercy for traitors. America, indeed, the world, is depending on it!!",

Controlled, clinical panic can be a ferocious and unstoppable adversary. The GOP, other than pay a bit of lip service, won’t do what is required, and that leaves President Trump and us. Don’t let him try to do it on his own. They will ultimately break him, or worse, attempt to “take him out.” Don’t underestimate them – they will.<br /><br />From hereon in, folks it must be complete solidarity, Trump, and us, locked tightly together, and wholesomely united in the MAGA movement. No mistakes, no missteps, no mercy for traitors. America, indeed, the world, is depending on it!!",

The move would be a significant escalation in the long-running war on drugs that has been raging under the auspices of the United States for many decades to the dismay of many Latin American countries.Graham continues to ignore the disastrous results of the use of force in US foreign policy as he eyes adding Mexico to his growing bucket list of interventionist missions. If previous interventions serve as examples, a US military intervention in Mexico would be just another excuse to expand national security interests and mire the country in another costly conflict.Matamoros AttackGraham’s comments on using military force in Mexico were sparked when four Americans were kidnapped in Matamoros on the Mexican side of the border with Texas. The area is known for having a heavy drug cartel presence due to its proximity to the US-Mexico border. The four Americans have been identified as Latavia “Tay” McGee, Shaeed Woodard, Zindell Brown, and Eric James Williams.McGee’s mother told reporters that her daughter was traveling to undergo a cosmetic surgical procedure with the other three. They were fired on in downtown Matamoros and loaded into a pickup truck. A local woman, Areli Pablo Servando, was also killed by a stray bullet in the attack. Brown and Woodard were eventually found dead, while Williams and McGee survived.Later, a letter of apology along with five men found with their hands tied were turned over to authorities of the Tamaulipas state law enforcement purportedly by the Scorpion faction of the Gulf Cartel. The organization extended its apology to the families of the victims and to the people of Matamoros in general for the poor decision-making and discipline of its affiliated associates.This public relations move indicated that the cartel was alarmed by the outcry following the attack and wanted to frame it as an unusual incident outside of the ordinary rules under which it operates. Chances are that the cartel wanted to do anything they could to avoid direct US military confrontation.Policymakers against the CartelsGraham told Fox News that he would introduce legislation “to make certain Mexican drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations under US law and set the stage to use military force if necessary to protect America from being poisoned by things coming out of Mexico.” This highlights the concern surrounding the trafficking of fentanyl into the US from Mexico and the deadly toll it has been having on the population, and there is a growing sentiment, especially among Republican leaders, for more to be done about it.Former attorney general Bill Barr concurred with the notion of US military action against cartels and recommended declaring the groups as “foreign terrorist organizations.” Texas representative Dan Crenshaw and Florida representative Michael Waltz have expressed their desires to authorize the president to use military force against “those responsible for trafficking fentanyl or a fentanyl-related substance into the United States or carrying out other related activities that cause regional destabilization in the Western Hemisphere.” Seventeen Republicans have cosponsored that resolution.Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on Twitter that the US “should strategically strike and take out the Mexican Cartels, not the Mexican government or their people, but the Mexican Cartels which control them all.” This common assurance that America’s execution of military plans will simply target the right people and nobody else has been used in virtually every instance of the US using force in foreign conflicts. It shows either the hubris of US foreign policy or its indifference to the lives of its innocent victims abroad.Roots of ViolenceThese calls for military intervention would serve as another layer of policies and actions already implemented by the US that have had disastrous consequences. After all, the violence in Mexico is an extension of the war on drugs started by American policy. In just the last decade, the US Drug Enforcement Administration has been found laundering millions of dollars in cash and delivering drugs for Mexican traffickers, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives was found to have illegally proliferated nearly two thousand firearms with the intention of tracking criminal elements.

Notoriously this post was held by the German agent Mathias Correa, who set up the Correa Group, which ultimately controls both the CIA and the FBI. Correa, it will be remembered, worked for the German agent James Forrestal, very properly executed by the Office of Naval Intelligence in 1949. Amongst the blood-stained Forrestal’s many crimes was facilitating the brutal executions on Saipan by the Japanese Kempeitei of intrepid American aviators Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan in 1937.Earhart and Noonan had been shot down by Mitsubishi A5M Claude fighters flying from the carrier IJN Akagi (officially in refit, although was no more than a Japanese deception operation) whilst flying on a photo reconnaissance mission for the ONI over illegal Japanese fortifications in the Marshall Islands.The execution of poor, brave Amelia Earhart in particular was one of the most brutal ever carried out in the 20th century. Noonan had been murdered first, in a fit of rage by a Kempeitei NCO after he threw feces at him, having been denied adequate sanitary facilities.The Japs opened up Fred’s grave and forced Amelia to stand by his partially decomposed body, in the full knowledge that she was about to join him. Eyewitness reports suggest that Amelia Earhart, to her eternal credit and to the credit of her great country, went to her death with remarkable composure. The truth was discovered after the liberation of Saipan by US forces in 1944 and may have prompted the mass suicide of Japanese civilians at Marpi Point.Although the decision was taken at the time to suppress the truth it is quite likely that it played a part in the perfectly proper Anglo-American decision to attack Japan with nuclear weapons the following year after fair warning had been given that the Allies were in possession of an advanced new weapon of devastating power.
