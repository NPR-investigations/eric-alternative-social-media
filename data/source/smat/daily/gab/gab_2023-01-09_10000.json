Why did Afghanistan collapse so fast? Was the Intel Committee under Adam Schiff focused on impeachment and not on the safety of America? Why are people coming across the border that are on a terrorist watch list? What are they doing about it? Their own members on that committee say it’s not happening when it’s true.

The state, the group alleged, was “‘patient dumping’ or ‘warehousing patients’ by allowing them to remain unnecessarily institutionalized,” she wrote.She also reported on a letter Republican Senate President Craig Blair sent to Gov. Jim Justice asking for a formal probe into the allegations.The fired reporter said leaders at the Health and Human Resources department had “threatened to discredit” WVPB, a publicly funded television and radio network.Instead, Knisely was allegedly let go.“It is crucial for the press to hold government agencies accountable,” Knisely said in a statement Tuesday. “It must be emphasized that these events followed my reporting on the mistreatment of people with disabilities, who are in state care.”She claimed the order came from WVPB Executive Director Butch Antolini, the former communications director for the Justice. Antolini stepped up to the job in 2021 — his predecessor was ousted after Justice overhauled the agency’s governing board. Justice himself had a history of trying to eliminate the annual $4 million in state funding for WVPB.Antolini has not commented on Knisely, but other officials denied any effort to influence coverage.West Virginia Educational Broadcasting Authority chairman William H. File III claims Knisely was not fired and still remains on the station’s payroll. He noted that Antolini “was not coerced or pressured by anyone.”Knisely claims the state asked her for a “complete retraction” on a story she wrote in November, one month after she was hired at WVPB.Though that didn’t happen, her news director, Eric Douglas, told her she could no longer cover the state’s Health and Human Resources department because the state was threatening to discredit the network.Knisely filed a human resources complaint about interference with her reporting on Dec. 15, but was told just five days later that part-time positions were being eliminated. Her email and key card stopped working around that time.Sauce: https://nypost.com/2023/01/09/west-virginia-journalist-amelia-ferrell-knisely-fired-after-investigating-alleged-abuse-at-state-facilities/",
