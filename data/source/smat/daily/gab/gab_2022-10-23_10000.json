They made a choice [not to get vaccinated]. They chose not to do a very harmless thing that protects the rest of society.  F**k ‘em. 1,400 people voluntarily quit their jobs rather than get vaccinated. They don’t deserve their jobs back. We have thousands and thousands of vacancies in city government right now. I’m worried about filling all of those jobs more than I’m worried about giving people who volunteered to leave their job back.”• Baugh: “I don’t give a sh*t. They are like, ‘This is unfair.’ F**king deal with it. We’re allowed to set the terms of employment. Period.”• Baugh: “I have no sympathy for those people. That was the rule. You had a very cushy government job…Again, no one was required to get vaccinated. You just had to get vaccinated if you had a job. So, you could have moved to Florida.”• Baugh: “The cops are mad at us though because we rolled back the private sector mandate, but we’re not rolling back the public sector mandate…COVID is over is the short answer. Why are we still doing it [vaccine mandate] for the public sector? I don’t know. We will probably stop that in a few months.”• Baugh: “Being a cop is like the cushiest gig in the city. Like, you might get shot, but otherwise it’s very good.”• Baugh: “I’ve just always joked -- New York is sort of like Hogwarts. Like, it’s a lot of fun, great opportunities, and people die.”[NEW YORK – Oct. 19, 2022] Project Veritas Action released a second video today exposing the staff and inside workings of New York City mayor Eric Adams.  Chris Baugh, an official working inside the Mayor’s office, told an undercover journalist what NYC policymakers think about public servants who lost their jobs because of the COVID vaccine mandate.“I have no sympathy for them. They made a choice [not to get vaccinated]. They chose not to do a very harmless thing that protects the rest of society.  F**k ‘em. 1,400 people voluntarily quit their jobs rather than get vaccinated. They don’t deserve their jobs back,” Baugh said.“We have thousands and thousands of vacancies in city government right now. I’m worried about filling all of those jobs more than I’m worried about giving people who volunteered to leave their job back,” he said.In several other instances, Baugh continued to double down on the lack of compassion these unvaccinated individuals deserve.“I don’t give a sh*t. They are like, ‘This is unfair.’ F**king deal with it. We’re allowed to set the terms of employment. Period,” he said.“I have no sympathy for those people. That was the rule. You had a very cushy government job…Again, no one was required to get vaccinated. You just had to get vaccinated if you had a job. So, you could have moved to Florida.”Baugh also spoke about how Mayor Adams feels about this matter.“He said, ‘They quit. Why should they get their jobs back? They quit.’”The city official went on to dismiss concerns expressed by NYPD officers.“The cops are mad at us though because we rolled back the private sector mandate, but we’re not rolling back the public sector mandate…COVID is over is the short answer. Why are we still doing it [vaccine mandate] for the public sector? I don’t know. We will probably stop that in a few months,” Baugh said.“Being a cop is like the cushiest gig in the city.
