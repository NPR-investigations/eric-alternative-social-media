By Jim HoftFor decades the Democrats and leftists have fought ferociously to prevent the cleanup of State voter registration rolls. Recognizing a potential niche, left wing activists created ERIC to clean voter rolls their way, using their rules. So in 2012 the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) was formed as a membership organization primarily for blue States. ERIC is essentially a left wing voter registration drive disguised as voter roll clean up. But it’s been gaining traction in Red States too. Originally funded by the Soros Open Society, it is now responsible for cleaning the voter rolls in 31 States, plus D.C. A top election official from each member State is appointed a seat on the ERIC Board or as an Officer, all unpaid positions.ERIC located 17 million new voters for the 2020 election, the most in the history of their organization. For comparison, they only found 5.7 million in 2012, Obama’s reelection.The ERIC database is comprehensive and would be one of the most coveted by bad actors looking to influence an election. Member States must not only submit all details on inactive and active voters to ERIC every 60 days. But they must also provide every individual in their states Motor Vehicle Department database, both licensed and ID recipients. This combo of data is breathtaking. It’s everyone who could generate a legal ballot. It includes those approaching voting age, even those here illegally yet issued an ID by their left leaning State. This data includes names, addresses, DOB, License #, last 4 of social #, voter activity, phone, email, title and type of citizenship documentation, and much more!ERIC doesn’t just manage lists, they demand action. But it’s not the action you would expect, like cleaning voter rolls. ERIC provides each member State a targeted list of people that are not registered to vote. The Membership Bylaws require the State to contact at least 95% of these people within 90 days, soliciting them to register. ERIC also wants specific registration profiles updated and requires the State to contact these voters within 90 days too. It’s essentially a left wing voter registration drive all paid for by the States, not the Democrat Party. The membership fee is $25,000 but costs can run into the millions to fund the activities and membership dues.Oddly, ERIC has no requirement or mandate that member States clean up their voter rolls. States are only “strongly encouraged” to request ERIC’s voter updates at least once a year. If a member fails to make a request in 425 days, the data will be sent automatically. What’s even more odd, and seemingly corrupt, is that ERIC does NOT want to know who is voting illegally.

Remove in eligible felons. Remove prisoners. Then you can look at the fact that this country has never voted at over 80% in it's entire existence. And not over 75% since 1897. Which puts Michigan around 2,500,000 over registered. Wow that number is very close to the change of registered voter between Nov1 2020 and Nov 7 2020. When Michigan added 2 600,000 new registered voters. Just coincidence? Just coincidence they are over registered even after giving millions to ERIC to clean the voter database? Just coincidence they quit counting in the evening? Just coincidence when they started counting in the morning the lead reversed? Just coincidence ballots were delivered to the TCF center in the middle of the night? Just coincidence Wayne County counted 125,000 mail in ballots as votes that matched no registered voter? Just coincidence Antrim County had such a big change they called human error? Just a coincidence the voting machines that the state was forced to allow an audit. Had the 2020 log files erased. Even though the 2018 and 2016 logs were intact?I do not know about you. But I was raised there are always coincidences. However 2 coincidences are very rare to happen together.

Which puts Michigan around 2,500,000 over registered. Wow that number is very close to the change of registered voter between Nov1 2020 and Nov 7 2020. When Michigan added 2 600,000 new registered voters. Just coincidence? Just coincidence they are over registered even after giving millions to ERIC to clean the voter database? Just coincidence they quit counting in the evening? Just coincidence when they started counting in the morning the lead reversed? Just coincidence ballots were delivered to the TCF center in the middle of the night? Just coincidence Wayne County counted 125,000 mail in ballots as votes that matched no registered voter? Just coincidence Antrim County had such a big change they called human error? Just a coincidence the voting machines that the state was forced to allow an audit. Had the 2020 log files erased. Even though the 2018 and 2016 logs were intact? I do not know about you. But I was raised there are always coincidences. However 2 coincidences are very rare to happen together. And 3 coincidences, well we probably are not talking coincidences any more. 8 to 10 coincidences can not even be considered.",

Aug 19, 2022For months, grassroots groups have sounded the alarm about ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center), a system used in 31 states that was originally funded by the Soros Open Society, and how it is bloating the voter rolls.Now, evidence indicates ERIC is politically compromised.Meanwhile, the clock ticks down to the 2022 election, even as the number of Michigan’s registered voters climbs dangerously—and impossibly—to 104% of its Voting Aged Population (VAP).On Monday, MI Rep. Ann Bollin (R), Chair of House Elections & Ethics Committee, announced, “We have initiated a deeper dive on our end with our legal counsel as we prep for an oversight hearing or letter of inquiry.”MI Rep. Ann Bollin’s announcement came in response to Michigan Fair Elections’ urgent warning that Verity Vote had exposed the ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center)—the organization chartered with cleaning the state’s voter rolls—as politically compromised. The Representative’s announcement followed months of citizen research and a steady rain of alarming evidence surrounding ERIC, and it signaled the ship of state may be turning. Meanwhile, the countdown clock ticks toward November’s mid-term elections, and ERIC continues to insert bias and bloat into the state’s qualified voter files. Legislative leaders are left with scant options to avert a looming election integrity crisis.People have long known that ERIC obstructs transparency. It registers noncitizens, enjoys illegal access to Michigan residents’ personal information, and fails to remove moved, ineligible and dead voters. But on June 17, http://Verityvote.us, led by citizen investigator Heather Honey, demonstrated that the left-wing organization had crossed a red line.“The primary effect of ERIC is to grow the voter rolls by converting eligible-but-unregistered (EBU) persons into registered voters.

          "contentraw": "New Evidence Shows Crooked Electronic Voter Registration System ERIC Is Politically Compromised...STUNNING 104% of Voting Aged Population In MI Is Registered To Vote! Aug 19, 2022<br /><br />For months, grassroots groups have sounded the alarm about ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center), a system used in 31 states that was originally funded by the Soros Open Society, and how it is bloating the voter rolls.<br /><br />Now, evidence indicates ERIC is politically compromised.<br />Meanwhile, the clock ticks down to the 2022 election, even as the number of Michigan’s registered voters climbs dangerously—and impossibly—to 104% of its Voting Aged Population (VAP).<br /><br />On Monday, MI Rep. Ann Bollin (R), Chair of House Elections &amp; Ethics Committee, announced, “We have initiated a deeper dive on our end with our legal counsel as we prep for an oversight hearing or letter of inquiry.”<br />MI Rep. Ann Bollin’s announcement came in response to Michigan Fair Elections’ urgent warning that Verity Vote had exposed the ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center)—the organization chartered with cleaning the state’s voter rolls—as politically compromised. The Representative’s announcement followed months of citizen research and a steady rain of alarming evidence surrounding ERIC, and it signaled the ship of state may be turning. Meanwhile, the countdown clock ticks toward November’s mid-term elections, and ERIC continues to insert bias and bloat into the state’s qualified voter files. Legislative leaders are left with scant options to avert a looming election integrity crisis.<br /><br />People have long known that ERIC obstructs transparency. It registers noncitizens, enjoys illegal access to Michigan residents’ personal information, and fails to remove moved, ineligible and dead voters. But on June 17, <a href=\"http://Verityvote.us\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>Verityvote.us<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>, led by citizen investigator Heather Honey, demonstrated that the left-wing organization had crossed a red line.<br /><br />“The primary effect of ERIC is to grow the voter rolls by converting eligible-but-unregistered (EBU) persons into registered voters. States divulge to ERIC personally identifying information of unregistered residents, including people who have declined to register for privacy reasons. FOIAs reveal that ERIC is sharing EBU records with Zuckerberg-funded CEIR.”<br /><br />In other words, ERIC not only receives residents’ legally protected information, but it also transfers that data to a fellow leftist organization. And that’s the tip of the iceberg. Wait until you read what the Center for Electronic Innovation does with the juicy information.<br /><br />Sample letter.

By agreement, they also hand over all records of individuals who went to the department of motor vehicles (DMV) and other places where people are given a chance to register to vote….Since voter registration is offered in these places, all personal information is shared with ERIC, even if the individual did not register to vote, Verity Vote found. “This appears to violate federal law,” the report says. “The NVRA prohibits states from sharing any records that relate to a declination to register to vote, or to the identity of a voter registration agency through which any particular voter is registered.” ERIC’s website says it has handled 56 million voters.Although ERIC is required to protect personally identifiable information, the report documents how ERIC shares the data with CEIR.  “CEIR is creating the lists of voters who should be targeted for voter registration efforts and laundering the lists back through ERIC for distribution to the states,” the report says.https://link.theepochtimes.com/mkt_app/report-critical-of-group-managing-voter-rolls-in-33-states_4673222.html",

How we recently went to court seeking Protection orders, of which the judge ruled that it was the wrong court so a no, but urged us to seek lawyers because we have legitimate concerns and evidence, he stated (judge Rect), \"your concerns are valid and no, neighbors can't harass and annoy because they want to\", he then chastised them and refused their testimony, he wouldn't let a single one speak, it was clear they came as a gang with no evidence and after the judge asked where everything took place \" our private property\", he in his clarity and wisdom refused them and their lawyer, Mr Whiting from speaking.<br /><br />Well, now we have Absolute evidence that the FEDS, ad in federal agents ARE staying at the very property that belongs to the 2 people we were trying to get the protection order against!!!<br /><br />Incredible! We are the victims and the feds ARE surveilling us. <br />We wondered WHY things were slightly quieter lately now we know.<br /><br />We are not criminals<br />We mind our own business<br />We stay home<br />We speak to no one because we are mocked and harassed.<br />Our dogs have been poisoned 3 times.<br />We have now fenced giant dogs into a 20x60 ft yard out of 5 acres because these mentally ill drunks, Actually Terrorize innocent animals.<br /><br />We e stayed off of here lately but now we are going to come back, if we disappear YOU will know Corrupt evil is at fault.",

When Michigan added 2 600,000 new registered voters. Just coincidence? Just coincidence they are over registered even after giving millions to ERIC to clean the voter database? Just coincidence they quit counting in the evening? Just coincidence when they started counting in the morning the lead reversed? Just coincidence ballots were delivered to the TCF center in the middle of the night? Just coincidence Wayne County counted 125,000 mail in ballots as votes that matched no registered voter? Just coincidence Antrim County had such a big change they called human error? Just a coincidence the voting machines that the state was forced to allow an audit. Had the 2020 log files erased. Even though the 2018 and 2016 logs were intact? I do not know about you. But I was raised there are always coincidences. However 2 coincidences are very rare to happen together.

Es mag zwar wahr sein, daß eine Einstellung der russischen Erdgaslieferungen einen Zusammenbruch der deutschen Volkswirtschaft auslösen könnte, aber es ist doch keinesfalls so, daß dem deutschen Rumpfstaat ohne den erneuerten amerikanischen Handelskrieg gegen Rußland eine glänzende Zukunft beschieden gewesen wäre.

            "description": "„Die alten Weisen nannten den einen klugen Kämpfer, der nicht nur siegt, sondern sich dadurch auszeichnet, daß er mit Leichtigkeit siegt. Seine Siege werden ihm aber weder den Ruf der Weisheit noch den des Mutes einbringen. Denn soweit sie durch Umstände errungen werden, die nicht ans Licht gekommen sind, wird die Allgemeinheit nichts von ihnen wissen, und deshalb wird man ihn nicht wegen seiner Weisheit loben; und wenn sich der feindliche Staat unterwirft, ehe ein Tropfen Blut geflossen ist, wird man ihn nicht für seinen Mut rühmen. Er gewinnt seine Schlachten, indem er keine Fehler macht. Keine Fehler zu machen ist die Grundlage für die Gewißheit des Sieges, denn es bedeutet, einen Feind zu besiegen, der bereits geschlagen ist. So bringt sich der umsichtige Kämpfer in eine Position, die die Niederlage unmöglich macht, und er versäumt nicht den richtigen Augenblick, den Feind zu schlagen. So sucht im Krieg der siegreiche Stratege nur dann den Kampf, wenn der Sieg bereits errungen ist, wogegen einer, der zum Untergang verurteilt ist, zuerst kämpft und danach den Sieg sucht. Eine siegreiche Armee, die gegen eine geschlagene antritt, ist ein ganzes Pfund gegen ein einziges Korn auf der Waagschale. Der Ansturm der siegreichen Streitkräfte ist wie das Hereinbrechen aufgestauter Wasser in eine tausend Faden tiefe Schlucht.“ (Sun Tzu, „Die Kunst des Krieges“)",
