They match the ones listed in the posting.Some side notes: A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not the Gospel message (1 John 3:23, 1 John 5:10). Those born again will automatically “remain” in Jesus.By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. A person ultimately only affects him or herself and forever’s a long time. We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law.Out of MANY so far, haven’t met a Roman Catholic YET who is able to correctly answer the ONE question guaranteed to give that person confidence on the Day of Judgment if heartfelt as is implied in 1 John 4:17 and to save him/her from that “second death” as Revelation 21:8 puts it while an incorrect answer guarantees the polar opposite of confidence on the Day of Judgment. Instead, sadly, it will be a matter of one “shrinking back and being destroyed” as Hebrews 10:19 implies. There's a HUGE difference between a ROMAN Catholic church and a HOLY Catholic church which is the reason for the Great Schism of 1054. Eastern Orthodoxy ended up siding with the HOLY Catholic church while Western Orthodoxy sided with ROMAN Catholic church (see also Nicene Creed for more information). I personally like how this one priest in Alaska put it once: “Yeah, but I don’t want any of that ‘Rome’ stuff.”There are –ONLY– four basic criteria from Jesus which equal salvation if given correctly while one giving them incorrectly equals no salvation. What were they again? Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm ) can answer them eventually while someone either not born again or in a cult or a false religion cannot, unfortunately. Scripture references are nice but not mandatory. The principles, on the other hand, those are MOST critical.) That’s quite important to answer since forever’s a long time. Thanks in advance!(Fill-in-the-blank time...LOL!)(One is already listed but there are 3 more.) (Exact verses are not necessary. The concepts, however, are crucial. Forever’s a long time.)(Actually, never mind. They simply avoid the question. That says something. The reason why it’s always avoided is because they do not have the ability to fill in the blank. Instead of going around and around and around and around and around and around that “avoidance” flagpole again, will instead provide the answer.)A: Mark 1:15, John 3:1-6, John 14:6, John 19:30. Again...ONLY.Those are naturally followed by Jesus’ Resurrection (Matthew 28:6, John 14:19b, Hebrews 7:23-25).(See Romans 5:10 and Galatians 2:19-21 for more information. Lest anyone forget that we are FORGIVEN through Calvary (John 19:30) but it’s His life which SAVES.)(That “no ability to answer” scenario is actually tragic because that’s a lot of individuals.)LOTS and LOTS of idolatry in Roman Catholicism. (That’s fancy talk for “LOTS and LOTS of Hebrew Roots Movement in Roman Catholicism.”) Sad. Roman Catholicism along with HRM are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking. Can only recommend for an individual’s sake alone that repentance is reached and that “Roman Catholicism” stuff is IMMEDIATELY abandoned. Somebody attempting to blend the Torah and Calvary is basically wasting your time. They do not blend. (Also see Matthew 9:16, Mark 2:22 and Romans 5:10 for more information.)",
