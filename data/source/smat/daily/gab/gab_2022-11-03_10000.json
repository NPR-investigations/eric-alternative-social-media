A Lesbian is a woman who truly prefers sex with women over sex with men, and there aren't many such women of our race. Women have good instincts. Even if they have been involved in affairs with one of their own sex, almost invariably when the right man becomes available they prefer him as a sexual partner. Just like yourself.

That seems to be what most guys want.\"\"Well, I don't know much about that, but you just said, 'a show for their guy to watch'. Seems like there's still a man at the root of things, so I still wouldn't call it Lesbianism, even though I suppose they enjoy the sex. Shirley told me that she thought most women had a secret urge to try it with another woman at some time in their life. But even if she was wrong, I know women are born actresses and they love to put on a show.\"\"For a man, you sure know a lot about women,\" Dory observed, \"and yeah, I think lots of girls want to try it with another girl at some time. I even had a crush on a teacher one time. And I wouldn't mind putting on a show for you, but no one ever saw me and Gloria.\"\"So do you think the girls in threesomes really enjoy the sex with the other gal?\" he asked.\"Oh, unless they have some hangups, they would have to. I mean, a girl's body responds to touch, especially in certain places regardless. A tongue or a finger inside her or tickling her love button, and her mind isn't thinking, and her body is just squirming around wanting it. That's as honest as I can be,\" she answered. \"Now you be honest, you would have loved to watch me and Gloria, huh?\"‚ÄúWow, you like to put me on the spot, don't you?

Convents for nuns, harem quarters, all-girl schools, for example. And of course in times of war the male population was decimated. So it appears that women often satisfied their sexual needs with each other. I believe that such relationships are wrongfully called Lesbian. They are substitutions for men. A Lesbian is a woman who truly prefers sex with women over sex with men, and there aren't many such women of our race. Women have good instincts. Even if they have been involved in affairs with one of their own sex, almost invariably when the right man becomes available they prefer him as a sexual partner. Just like yourself.

That seems to be what most guys want.\"\"Well, I don't know much about that, but you just said, 'a show for their guy to watch'. Seems like there's still a man at the root of things, so I still wouldn't call it Lesbianism, even though I suppose they enjoy the sex. Shirley told me that she thought most women had a secret urge to try it with another woman at some time in their life. But even if she was wrong, I know women are born actresses and they love to put on a show.\"\"For a man, you sure know a lot about women,\" Dory observed, \"and yeah, I think lots of girls want to try it with another girl at some time. I even had a crush on a teacher one time. And I wouldn't mind putting on a show for you, but no one ever saw me and Gloria.\"\"So do you think the girls in threesomes really enjoy the sex with the other gal?\" he asked.\"Oh, unless they have some hangups, they would have to. I mean, a girl's body responds to touch, especially in certain places regardless. A tongue or a finger inside her or tickling her love button, and her mind isn't thinking, and her body is just squirming around wanting it. That's as honest as I can be,\" she answered. \"Now you be honest, you would have loved to watch me and Gloria, huh?\"‚ÄúWow, you like to put me on the spot, don't you? Well, you were honest, so I will be, too. Men get turned on seeing women's bodies, and two are twice as exciting as one, and I am a man. But the way I feel right now, I am content with just one woman and that is you.\"Dory's radiant smile and her one-word comment (\"good\") convinced Eric that he had said the right thing.\"So it's male homosexuals the Precept is referring to?\" Dory asked.\"In my opinion, yes. Queers spread diseases and they are notoriously promiscuous. And most importantly, in times of racial peril our men must fight for women and territory.\"\"So do you kill queers?\"\"If they came out of the closet and advocated such a 'life style', I'm sure the KD would execute them.\"",

A Lesbian is a woman who truly prefers sex with women over sex with men, and there aren't many such women of our race. Women have good instincts. Even if they have been involved in affairs with one of their own sex, almost invariably when the right man becomes available they prefer him as a sexual partner. Just like yourself. You do prefer me to Gloria, don't you?\"<br /><br />\"Of course, you big dummy,\" she giggled nervously.<br /><br />Eric continued, \"Anyhow, since Wotanists don't believe in that Christian nonsense that 'sex is sin', and because nothing is more dangerous to people's freedom than unnecessary laws and nosy busy-bodies, neither Lesbianism nor substituting a woman for a man are worth making a big deal about.\"<br /><br />\"What about threesomes, two girls and a guy, with the girls putting on a show with each other for him to watch? That seems to be what most guys want.\"<br /><br />\"Well, I don't know much about that, but you just said, 'a show for their guy to watch'. Seems like there's still a man at the root of things, so I still wouldn't call it Lesbianism, even though I suppose they enjoy the sex. Shirley told me that she thought most women had a secret urge to try it with another woman at some time in their life. But even if she was wrong, I know women are born actresses and they love to put on a show.\"<br /><br />\"For a man, you sure know a lot about women,\" Dory observed, \"and yeah, I think lots of girls want to try it with another girl at some time. I even had a crush on a teacher one time. And I wouldn't mind putting on a show for you, but no one ever saw me and Gloria.\"<br /><br />\"So do you think the girls in threesomes really enjoy the sex with the other gal?\" he asked.<br /><br />\"Oh, unless they have some hangups, they would have to. I mean, a girl's body responds to touch, especially in certain places regardless. A tongue or a finger inside her or tickling her love button, and her mind isn't thinking, and her body is just squirming around wanting it. That's as honest as I can be,\" she answered. \"Now you be honest, you would have loved to watch me and Gloria, huh?\"<br /><br />‚ÄúWow, you like to put me on the spot, don't you? Well, you were honest, so I will be, too. Men get turned on seeing women's bodies, and two are twice as exciting as one, and I am a man. But the way I feel right now, I am content with just one woman and that is you.\"<br /><br />Dory's radiant smile and her one-word comment (\"good\") convinced Eric that he had said the right thing.<br /><br />\"So it's male homosexuals the Precept is referring to?\" Dory asked.<br /><br />\"In my opinion, yes. Queers spread diseases and they are notoriously promiscuous. And most importantly, in times of racial peril our men must fight for women and territory.\"<br /><br />\"So do you kill queers?\"<br /><br />\"If they came out of the closet and advocated such a 'life style', I'm sure the KD would execute them.\"",

(With hard data.)For example, New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport, all run by Democratic mayors, had a collective murder rate in 2019 of 28.1 per 100,000, more than three times the 8.3-per-100,000 rate in the rest of Louisiana. That drove up the statewide count by 41%, to 11.7 per 100,000.Among the 50 largest US cities, homicide rates were 68% higher in blue vs. red ones. Similarly, per the Manhattan Institute‚Äôs Robert VerBruggen and Christos Makridis: ‚ÄúCounties with a higher share of GOP voters not only have lower homicide rates but also a lower growth in homicide rates between 2019 and 2020.‚ÄùHochul is desperate to have New Yorkers think the crime surge is all in their head. She even asked her rival for governor, Rep. Lee Zeldin, why locking up criminals is ‚Äúso important‚Äù to him.Never mind that citywide murders last year were 67% higher than in 2017, and that, though they‚Äôve fallen slightly this year, other crimes continue to soar: As of Sunday, rapes in Gotham were up 10.9% over last year, robberies 32.4%, grand larcenies 38.5% and car thefts 34.5%.The gov has totally caved to her party‚Äôs radicals, who refuse to admit that their policies (mandatory no-bail releases, defunding the police, easier parole) have set crime ablaze. They cling to cherry-picked stats supposedly proving that their catastrophic bail reform is irrelevant to the carnage, yet numerous critics ‚Äî from Democratic Mayor Eric Adams to left-leaning Albany District Attorney David Soares to ex-Queens prosecutor Jim Quinn (not to mention us) ‚Äî have all cited comprehensive data thoroughly debunking that claim.",

Similarly, per the Manhattan Institute‚Äôs Robert VerBruggen and <br />Christos Makridis: ‚ÄúCounties with a higher share of GOP voters not only have lower homicide rates but also a lower growth in homicide rates between <br />2019 and 2020.‚Äù<br />Hochul is desperate to have New Yorkers think the crime surge is all in their head. She even asked her rival for governor, Rep. Lee Zeldin, why <br />locking up criminals is ‚Äúso important‚Äù to him.<br />Never mind that citywide murders last year were 67% higher than in 2017, and that, though they‚Äôve fallen slightly this year, other crimes continue to <br />soar: As of Sunday, rapes in Gotham were up 10.9% over last year, robberies 32.4%, grand larcenies 38.5% and car thefts 34.5%.<br />The gov has totally caved to her party‚Äôs radicals, who refuse to admit that their policies (mandatory no-bail releases, defunding the police, easier <br />parole) have set crime ablaze. They cling to cherry-picked stats supposedly proving that their catastrophic bail reform is irrelevant to the carnage, <br />yet numerous critics ‚Äî from Democratic Mayor Eric Adams to left-leaning Albany District Attorney David Soares to ex-Queens prosecutor Jim Quinn <br />(not to mention us) ‚Äî have all cited comprehensive data thoroughly debunking that claim.",
