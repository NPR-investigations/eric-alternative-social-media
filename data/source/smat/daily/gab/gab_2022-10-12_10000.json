Determined to stop his high-octane lethal feud is Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen.\r\nPredictably, the inquisition starts in the city’s police headquarters. There, the veteran cop finds nailing a jelly to the wall far easier than stopping a merc’ on a mission.\r\nIn the predator’s cross-hairs are the most sinister but successful sinners of Liverpool’s underworld. ‘Mess with the best, die like the rest’ appears to be Jack Scarlett’s maxim as after being crossed in love and trust he evens the score.\r\nThe killer question is, can Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen stop Jack Scarlett, and does he really want to. That is for you to decide.",

Dehmlow serves as the unit chief for the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF), and Chan is the head of the FBI’s San Francisco cyber division.Campaign finance records on the Federal Election Commission website show that both Dehmlow and Chan have contributed to the Democratic Party. In particular, Dehmlow donated a total of $60 to the Democratic National Committee in 2020, and Chan donated $50 each to Sens. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) ahead of their runoff election in November 2020.News of the FBI agents’ donations to the Democrats comes amid longstanding concerns of political bias in the domestic security service.

The county’s former registrar, Michele White, was recently indicted on corruption charges related to the 2020 cycle, but state and local officials are refusing to explain what the case is about.The new Prince William controversy centers on a state law that gives local political parties oversight of who’s serving as election officers and extra power to designate who should serve as chief and assistant chief election officers. The law requires parties to submit nominees for officers of election early in the year and instructs registrars to pull from those lists “if practicable” and prioritize partisan nominees for the chief roles.Republicans suggested Olsen was overreacting to a request that he follow a law that they said prohibits Prince William from using more experienced nonpartisan election officers if a Republican, no matter their experience level, is available.Source:  http://virginiamercury.com",

Wormuth also defended the Army’s DEI programs as “important.”“We get criticized, frankly, sometimes for being ‘woke.’ I’m not sure what ‘woke’ means. I think ‘woke’ means a lot of different things to different people,” said the secretary. “But, first of all, if ‘woke’ means we are not focused on warfighting, we are not focused on readiness, that doesn’t reflect what I see at installations all around the country or overseas when I go and visit.” Wormuth did not cite any examples of the readiness she claimed to be in place.“I do think we do have a wide range of soldiers in our Army, and we’ve got to make them all feel included,” Wormuth continued. “And that’s why a lot of our diversity, equity and inclusion programs are important.”Her comments were made as the entirety of the U.S. military shifts hard to the Left on race- and gender-based identity politics, a directive ordered by the Biden White House shortly after Joe Biden took power. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin once testified under oath that he would make sure that the Department of Defense rooted out so-called “White supremacists” within the military’s ranks, while Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said under oath that he wanted to teach the concept of “White rage” to the military.Most recently, the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado has been heavily criticized for showing cadets a diversity training lecture titled “Diversity &amp; Inclusion: What it is, why we care, &amp; what we can do.” The slides featured in the lecture ordered cadets to use “person-centered” language that “includes all genders,” and to refrain from using such gendered words as “mom” and “dad.”An Air Force Academy spokesman defended the training by claiming that it would improve the cadets’ “warfighting readiness.”“As part of the Diversity &amp; Inclusion Cadet Leadership Program, this conversation was developed by cadet leaders and USAFA staff to introduce all cadets to Department of the Air Force definitions of diversity and inclusion,” the spokesman said, “as well as how these concepts enhance our warfighting effectiveness.”",
