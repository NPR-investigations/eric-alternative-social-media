In addition, it seems ERIC doesn’t exist to purge or update voter rolls so much as to inflate them, identifying 17 million new voters in 2020 compared to purging just 3 million from state voter rolls. Despite its failure to clean voter rolls, a majority of states are still using the system, which is run by a left-wing activist named David Becker.

            "description": "Thank you for joining us for another episode of the Low Carb MD Podcast. Eric Edmeades is a serial entrepreneur with experience including wireless networking, military research, Hollywood film production, and award-winning and life-saving medical simulation. Today, Eric is a leading authority in Behavioral Change Dynamics. Eric has created and consulted on some of the most effective, transformative, and highly rated educational products and live events in the world. Eric is often referred to as the “Indiana Jones” of the professional speaker world because of his love of the African bush and his extensive visits with various tribes in Africa. In 2007 Eric established a friendship with the Hadza people — one of the last truly hunter/gatherer tribes left on earth and has visited them frequently over the last 10 years. In their conversation, Tro and Eric talk about the lifestyle and dietary habits of the Hadza tribe, the primary dietary predictors of disease and obesity, the natural impulse to seek out sweet foods, the social food culture of the Hadza tribe, the way that food companies play on this impulse to effect your diet, and Eric’s work in nutritional anthropology. For more information, please see the links below. Thank you for listening! Links: Eric Edmeades:      Dr. Brian Lenzkes:     Dr. Tro Kalayjian:      ",

Circuit Judge Jennifer Howell released McKinney from jail on his own recognizance on May 20.On Aug. 4, McKinney was arrested in Franklin County and charged with first-degree rape and incest involving a 16-year-old female. Franklin County Sheriff Shannon Oliver told reporters the victim claimed to have been raped multiple times and McKinney confessed when questioned by investigators. McKinney and the victim lived in the same Phil Campbell home, he said.\"The bottom line is that this gentleman should have never been released on his own recognizance — period,\" Morgan County District Attorney Scott Anderson said last week.Howell, however, said Anderson knew a motion to reduce bond was pending and had a month to object to it before she released McKinney on May 20.Anderson on Aug. 5, the day after the Franklin County arrest, filed a stinging motion to revoke McKinney's bond, which Howell granted 13 minutes later. The motion complained that Howell gave no notice to prosecutors before releasing McKinney and that she released him \"without ordering supervision of the Community Corrections Pretrial Release program.\"",

These people are unprincipled cage-fighters animated by their seething lust to destroy Orange Man Bad. Our upper echelon law enforcement has been transformed into an iron fist, and we’ve taken unprecedented blow after unprecedented blow for years now — presidential candidate Trump wiretapped, the Russia Hoax, two impeachments on the flimsiest of grounds, FBI raids of conservative journalists and political enemies (especially those in Trump’s orbit, including his attorneys Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani), and most recently, the reprehensible raid of the Trump family’s beloved home. Why on earth would you think these people will stop there?And because it’s unimaginable to conservatives to politicize and weaponize the DOJ and FBI to this extent, we’ve been caught flat-footed every time the establishment demolishes yet another norm of American civility.Did you think partisan Leftists are conducting all these endless trumped-up malicious prosecutions for fun? While that is undoubtedly part of it, there is now an all-out race to be the Historic™ first prosecutor to hack off a presidential scalp. The mad dash is on! Who will take that victory lap?

Either way, make no mistake: every one of these hacks is gunning for Trump’s head.What has always been unimaginable in the United States is now pretty much guaranteed: Yes, there will be an indictment of a former president. Leftists are saying it out loud now. Obama wingman and former weaponized AG Eric Holder said as much on Thursday, in an interview with Joe Madison on SiriusXM:My guess is that by the end of this process, you’re going to see indictments involving high-level people in the White House, you’re going to see indictments against people outside the White House who were advising them with regard to the attempt to steal the election, and I think ultimately you’re probably going to see the President, former President of the United States indicted as well.",
