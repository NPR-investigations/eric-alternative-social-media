THUS GAB MAY PUT YOUR POST INTO A MODERATION BASKET, WHICH DELAYS IT APPEARING HERE.PASSWORD IS CMUSIC.  Group for sharing & discussing CHRISTIAN MUSIC (primarily Christian SONGS).  That does not include promoting the idolatrous \"mass,\", nor idolatrous music worshipping (or \"venerating\") saints or Mary, nor the promotion of sacramentalism.  And this site is not for crack-pot false prophets to peddle their pretended prophecy.  Also this site is not for sermons & sermonettes which do not pertain to Christian Music -- nor such links/advertisements. A sister site is Bible & Born Again Christianity https://gab.com/groups/1884 . A step-sister group is Christian Poetry Plus.  Christian Poetry which lacks music is welcome there (also tear-jerker dog poems). https://gab.com/groups/1877 . Since some post really great Classical Music here, where it does not belong unless Christian Music, I started a Classical Music Group for Classical Music: https://gab.com/groups/1952 . If you want to post on COVID or vaccine issues, please do it at https://gab.com/groups/1892 . 4 Requests:1. PLEASE ID YOUR POST AS ABOUT CHRISTIAN MUSIC.  We get many posts which are OFF TOPIC. So help us out by NOT merely posting a link to some song without writing something to ID it as Christian Music.   If you are posting a link to a SONG which on the face of it, has no appearance of being Christian, but in fact it is, please write the lyrics so we won't misjudge it.  Some rock or modern songs have been posted here with incomprehensible lyrics which seem to have nothing Christian in them.  If you are posting the LYRICS of a song, please say so; then we will know that your post is about MUSIC & not just poetry.2. If the song you post has incomprehensible lyrics, please write out the lyrics.  (Attention: fans of heavy metal w/ incomprehensible screaming for lyrics).3. If your song is not in English or Spanish, you are thanked for providing a translation.4. If you post a Bible verse for our edification, please relate it to a song -- this group is for Christian MUSIC.  It is recommended that you link an appropriate song to your Bible verse.  Since the Word says to sing praises with understanding, it is fine to discuss the accuracy of words in a song (deliver us from super-spiritual pietism claiming \"just sing it, don't criticize it.\"",

Then, “By extra-constitutionally changing the franchise to over represent the landed nobility and propertied classes, Stolypin had acquired the parliament with which he believed he could work.”So, the Third Duma (1907-1912) was elected on a completely distorted franchise: “The vast majority of Russia’s people had been effectively disenfranchised.” That is the way it stayed till the end of the feudal autocratic tsarist empire.Suny observes that “The classical (what some would call ‘orthodox’) Marxist view of the nation, as articulated by most Social Democrats of the early twentieth century, began with the supposition that nations were products of history, not of nature, and that they were generated by material processes such as the need for national markets, state policies protecting those markets, and long-distance trade. Therefore, nations were objective, real, material, not merely the product of consciousness or a national spirit (Geist). …Nationalism, on the other hand, was a form of consciousness that arose as a nation was being formed, a subjective expression of the nation. This chronology - nation before nationalism - would be reversed in late twentieth-century nationalism theory in the work both of non-Marxists, like Elie Kedourie and Ernest Gellner, and Marxists, like Benedict Anderson and Eric Hobsbawm. They would propose that nations were a product of human action, of invention and imagination, as much if not more than of historical processes and greater social communication.”Late twentieth-century nationalism theory was in fact just a reversion to discredited old idealist theory, that ideas not realities determine history. That Anderson and Hobsbawm agreed with liberal anti-Marxists like Kedourie and Gellner shows that Anderson and Hobsbawm had abandoned Marxism.Suny notes that “Rosa Luxemburg … believed that Social Democrats should not defend the right of nations to self-determination since nations were kinds of fictions that in the real world were divided into classes.” So, Luxemburg agreed with the anti-Marxists. As a result, she opposed wars of national liberation, concluding absurdly that in the age of imperialism, “national wars can no longer exist.”",
