Orchestras, video game soundtracks, backing tracks of pop classics with ONLY the instruments audible, and so forth.\r\n\r\nUse of voices as an instrument (as in \"doobie doo\", \"la la la\", \"ahhhh\", or even \"hey\") is allowed, but not recommended due to the potential difficulty in determining what's a foreign language and what's just stringing syllables together.\r\n\r\nDigitally-isolated instrumentals are strongly discouraged since you tend to still be able to hear the lyrics when using headphones. Karaoke remakes are also discouraged due to their typically mediocre quality (and tendency to show the lyrics on-screen in their videos).\r\n\r\nGroup created and run by @Zebulan.",

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

The  goal is to follow in the foot steps of the book of ACTS.  Also to obey Revelation 18:4'Come out of her, my people,' so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues;  Feel free to post political articles that show why we must come out of her. Not just mentally but physically. I want you to think community in the sense of the Free State Project, Hasidic communities, Amish communities, etc...  There is much to say on the topic. Just know this is not a new concept and only for those that are truly called by GOD and want to do his will. \n\nTHE GROUP IS NOT FOR DEBATING ! \nITS FOR MOTIVATION AND BEING ABOUT THE FATHER BUSINESS !\nONLY KINGDOM BUILDING !
