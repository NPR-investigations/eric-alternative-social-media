The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

Let’s look at the facts as of now. The FBI raided Mar-a-Lago, looking for alleged classified documents, while Donald Trump was not present. The FBI reportedly did not find the alleged “classified” documents they were looking for, but they did take 15 boxes of documents from Trump’s home. The FBI did not reveal the reasonable cause to Trump’s legal team, Trump must sue for the right to see that apparently.",

Eric Trump said that the security cameras at Mar-a-Lago caught FBI agents behaving improperly during Monday’s raid, alleging that investigators were accessing parts of former President Donald Trump’s Florida residence that they “shouldn’t have been.”In an interview with DailyMail. com, Eric Trump said that because staff refused to turn off the surveillance cameras at the request of the FBI, the Mar-a-Lago cameras captured agents raiding areas that they weren’t authorized to.“There’s 30 agents there,” he recalled on Wednesday. “They told our lawyer…’You have to leave the property right now. Turn off all security cameras.'”Eric Trump said that the FBI refused to give Trump’s lawyer, Christina Bobb, a copy of the search warrant but “showed it to her from about 10 feet away,” DailyMail. com reported. He also said he would be “thrilled” to find out if there was a valid reason for the search.https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/08/update-eric-trump-says-mar-lago-security-cameras-captured-fbi-agents-behaving-improperly/",

Let’s look at the facts as of now. The FBI raided Mar-a-Lago, looking for alleged classified documents, while Donald Trump was not present. The FBI reportedly did not find the alleged “classified” documents they were looking for, but they did take 15 boxes of documents from Trump’s home. The FBI did not reveal the reasonable cause to Trump’s legal team, Trump must sue for the right to see that apparently.",

He didn’t even have anything in the safe,” the younger Trump told Fox News Sean Hannity on Monday.Eric declared that the raid was conducted to see whether his father possessed any potential confidential documents from his time in office. He also said the breach was likely politically motivated because Democrats don’t want his father to run again for president in 2024.“They started coming after him … the day he won [in] 2016,” Eric told the network, referencing Donald Trump becoming a politically motivated target.“It’s gone on past politics,” the second son of the 45th U.S. president added. “Look at the attorney generals, … district attorney’s all over the country—all they want to do is, they want to get Donald Trump.”“And they do it for one reason,” he noted. “Because they don’t want Donald Trump to run and win again in 2024.”SIGN UP FOR NTD DAILY What you need to know, summarized in one email.

Let’s look at the facts as of now. The FBI raided Mar-a-Lago, looking for alleged classified documents, while Donald Trump was not present. The FBI reportedly did not find the alleged “classified” documents they were looking for, but they did take 15 boxes of documents from Trump’s home. The FBI did not reveal the reasonable cause to Trump’s legal team, Trump must sue for the right to see that apparently.",

Trump told the Daily Mail that the FBI refused to to hand over the search warrant for their raid on the Florida residence.He also recalled about 30 FBI agents kicking his attorney off the property.&gt;&gt;“So they showed it to her from about 10 feet away. They would not give her a copy of the search warrant,” Trump said. &gt;&gt;“There’s 30 agents there… They told our lawyer … you have to leave the property right now. Turn off all security cameras,” Trump said. He said that the former president’s attorney Christina Bobb was forced to stand at the end of the Mar-a-Lago’s driveway during the raid. Calling the event another “coordinated attack” on his father, Trump said Bobb was confused why a lawyer for the person's home being raided by the FBI was not able to see or obtain a copy of the search warrant.He questioned whether a real warrant even existed, saying that he would be “thrilled” to know. &gt;&gt;\"When I arrived and kind of announced myself as the legal representation for President Trump.

'They told our lawyer… you have to leave the property right now. Turn off all security cameras.''They would not give her the search warrant,' he claimed.

It is part of a real insurrection, an insurrection that both swept an established, duly elected (and successful) government out of power and then attempted to intimidate, “cancel,” and terrorize that government’s supporters. It was -- and is -- an insurrection against the American people and American values.If it ultimately proves successful, it is the end of the republic.The same FBI and DoJ that have been trying to get Trump since the day he took office, even signing off on fake documents/dossiers, has now crossed the Rubicon and taken an enormous risk.

It is part of a real insurrection, an insurrection that both swept an established, duly elected (and successful) government out of power and then attempted to intimidate, “cancel,” and terrorize that government’s supporters. It was -- and is -- an insurrection against the American people and American values.<br /><br />If it ultimately proves successful, it is the end of the republic.<br /><br />The same FBI and DoJ that have been trying to get Trump since the day he took office, even signing off on fake documents/dossiers, has now crossed the Rubicon and taken an enormous risk.

Under the UN Charter, aggressive war is the supreme crime. So colonial conquests - stealing nations' rights to self-determination - are criminal.Most of the essays are about colonial conquests, for example, the German destruction of the Herero in 1904-08, France's assault on Algeria 1954-62 and the USA's attack on Vietnam in 1963-75, killing three million people. But there is no mention of the crimes committed abroad by the British ruling class, the slave trade, the recurrent famines in British India, its endless colonial wars, nor of the US-British attacks on China and King Leopold's pillage of the Congo in the 19th century, Japan's assault on China in the 1930s, the USA's attacks on Korea in 1950-53, killing two million civilians, or apartheid South Africa's wars against its neighbours.The editor includes Eric Langenbacher's misguided essay describing the Allied bombing of Nazi Germany as genocide. Yet it cut Germany's industrial production in 1944-45 by a fifth. Albert Speer, Hitler's minister for munitions, called the bombing the 'cause of all our setbacks'. It was a legitimate contribution to the just war against Nazism.The US and British states backed the slaughters in Guatemala from 1954, in Indonesia in 1965 (a million killed), Chile in 1973, Somalia in 1988, Rwanda in the 1990s, the sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s (killing an estimated 1.5 million people), Colombia now.In the 1991 US-British attack on Iraq, US forces used 940,000 DU shells and 62,000 cluster bombs, all illegal under the Geneva Conventions. The US-British attack on Yugoslavia in 1999 included attacks on civilians and the use of 31,000 DU rounds and 1,400 cluster bombs. The attack was illegal under the UN Charter and the US Constitution. The recent US-British attacks on Iraq and Afghanistan have killed respectively at least 100,000 and 3,600 civilians.As Marx wrote, capitalism was born in 'plundering, piracy, kidnapping slaves, and colonial conquest'. Now it is dying in 'plundering, piracy, kidnapping slaves, and colonial conquest'. Only by destroying capitalism will we end war.",

One lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, told Fox News on Thursday that agents are believed to have searched Trump’s bedroom, office, and a storage room.Because the FBI allegedly “didn’t allow anybody to supervise what they were doing, and they specifically requested to turn off the security cameras,” Kimbery Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.’s fiancée and an advisor to the former president’s 2020 campaign, told Newsmax. “Why? Because they didn’t want to be caught with what they were doing. How do you know there weren’t listening devices planted or evidence planted there?“It’s something that has to be investigated and checked out, and we want to see the affidavit and what was their probable cause to be able to go in there and break into the president’s home,” she added. For her claim, Guilfoyle did not provide evidence.Trump’s son Eric Trump told the Daily Mail on Wednesday that security cameras remained on when the agents carried out their search, accusing the agents of refusing to hand over a warrant and kicking lawyers off the premises. Agents, he said, told Trump’s team to turn off the cameras but they remained on, and those agents went to places “they shouldn’t have been.”No ResponseThe FBI and Department of Justice have not responded to requests for comment. The judge who approved the FBI warrant, Bruce Reinhart, ordered the Justice Department on Wednesday to respond to requests to unseal the warrant in the case.The White House said President Joe Biden was not aware of the FBI search before it was announced earlier this week. Top Republicans have called on the Department of Justice to release documents pertaining to the raid or to have Attorney General Merrick Garland speak about the matter.Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray have remained silent on the Mar-a-Lago search.
