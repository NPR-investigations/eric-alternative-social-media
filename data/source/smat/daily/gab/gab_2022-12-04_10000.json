            "description": "This group embraces the traditionalism of those pioneers of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s known as the New Conservatives. The New Conservatives were a loose group of conservative academics and scholars who after the crisis of World War II revived interest in Western civilization and American cultural renewal. The New Conservatives also brought about a renaissance in the study of the life and work of Anglo-Irish statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke. Their immediate forebears included the New Humanists, the Distributists, T. S. Eliot, Ralph Adams Cram, C. S. Lewis, Herbert Agar, Bernard Iddings Bell, Christopher Dawson, and the Southern Agrarians.\nArticles:\n\"Understanding Traditionalist Conservatism\" by Mark C.

          "content": "Federal Court Blocks Biden’s Attempt To Force Christian Doctors To Perform AbortionsThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Biden abortion mandate on August 26,&nbsp;ruling&nbsp;that religious doctors could not be required to perform procedures like abortion that violate their beliefs.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials had planned to revoke a Trump administration rule that protected pro-life medical workers from being forced to kill unborn babies in elective abortions.After establishing a new division to safeguard healthcare workers’ freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, the Trump Administration formalized protections for those who decline to participate in certain medical treatments like abortion, sterilization, or assisted suicide due to their faith or moral convictions.Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys filed suit presenting Christian doctors challenging two Biden administration mandates. They say the mandate forces religious nonprofit and for-profit employers to pay for and perform surgeries, procedures, counseling, and treatments that seek to alter one’s biological sex and to do abortions — actions that violate their religious beliefs.The Christian Medical &amp; Dental Associations told LifeNews that the end of the Biden mandate is a major victory for pro-life physicians to protect the religious beliefs of healthcare professionals from being forced to perform gender-transition procedures or abortions against their conscience and best medical judgment.“This key legal battle is a hard-fought victory that impacts and protects the rights of healthcare professionals across this country,” said CMDA CEO Mike Chupp, MD, FACS.“CMDA’s&nbsp;national polling&nbsp;proves that healthcare professionals of faith are committed to caring for all patients with dignity and respect,” said CMDA Senior Vice President of Bioethics and Public Policy Jeffrey Barrows, DO, MA (Ethics), who is an OBGYN.“No one should be forced to violate their conscience or sincere religious beliefs,” said Dr. Barrows. “Most importantly, each patient we treat is better off when healthcare professionals who are motivated by their convictions are free to provide quality care without being forced to check those convictions at the door.”“All employers, including those in the Christian Employers Alliance, have the constitutional right to conduct their business in a manner consistent with their deeply held religious beliefs.”“The employers we represent believe that God purposefully created humans as either male or female, and so it would violate their religious beliefs to pay for or perform life-altering medical procedures or surgeries that seek to change one’s biological sex. We urge the court to immediately halt enforcement of these unlawful mandates that disrespect people of faith”.The&nbsp;lawsuit&nbsp;explains that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is misinterpreting and improperly enforcing discrimination based on sex in Title VII to force religious employers to pay for and provide health insurance coverage for such surgeries and procedures. Additionally, the lawsuit challenges the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ reinterpretation of “sex” in federal law to include gender identity, thereby forcing religious healthcare providers to physically perform or facilitate surgeries and procedures that conflict with their deeply held beliefs.The HHS mandate also compels religious healthcare providers to speak positively about these procedures even if they disagree with them and prohibits them from sharing their medical opinions or objections. Neither the EEOC nor HHS provides religious exemptions to these mandates. If CEA members fail to comply with these mandates, they face loss of federal funds, the prospect of expensive and burdensome litigation, and in some cases fines, criminal penalties, and attorneys’ fees and costs.“Doctors, nurses, and other medical providers should enjoy this same constitutional protection, free to live and work in a manner consistent with their faith,” Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Matt Bowman said in a statement. “Yet the Biden administration’s proposed rule would abandon health care professionals to being forced to perform medical procedures that directly violate their religious beliefs or risk losing their jobs.”“This is an illegal and gross overreach of executive power, and we urge the administration to withdraw this harmful proposal immediately,” Bowman said.The Biden administration had until November 25th to appeal the ruling and failed to do so — meaning the mandate is now blocked by the appellate court.https://finishtherace.com/eric/federal-court-blocks-bidens-attempt-to-force-christian-doctors-to-do-abortions/?utm_source=FTR%20Newsletter%201&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=subscriber_id:42331951&amp;utm_campaign=Federal%20Judge%20Hands%20Down%20HUGE%20Win%20For%20Conservatives,%20Shoots%20Down%20Biden%27s%20Audacious%20Mandate%20(Duplicate%20%231)",
