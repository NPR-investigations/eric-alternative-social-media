Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored.Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it&#39;s an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The &quot;Antarctic Treaty&quot; prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, other lands beyond Antarctica ?This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language). Accounts set to &#39;Private&#39;, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers.This group has never, and will never, ask for a dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the multitudes of facts with undeniable evidence evoking our true Level and Stationary Earth Plane. Truth is like a breath of fresh air, Truth will break you free from the Echo Chamber of Deception.<br /><\/li><\/ul>",

Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored.Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it&#39;s an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The &quot;Antarctic Treaty&quot; prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, other lands beyond Antarctica ?This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language). Accounts set to &#39;Private&#39;, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers.This group has never, and will never, ask for a dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the multitudes of facts with undeniable evidence evoking our true Level and Stationary Earth Plane. Truth is like a breath of fresh air, Truth will break you free from the Echo Chamber of Deception.<br /><\/li><\/ul>",

Greitens denied the allegations and Gardner never produced any evidence.During Greitens’ felony invasion of privacy trial in May 2018, a forensic examiner extracted data from Greitens’ cellphone and email account. The examination revealed no photograph of Sneed was ever taken or deleted by Greitens.Gardner withdrew her indictment of Greitens when the judge ordered that Gardner herself would have to testify in the case.

          "content": "2 of 2 -A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story) but it fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on.(SIDE NOTE: Both the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.)By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:3-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm )  is only qualified to teach the new covenant (study 2 Corinthians 3:4-11).

          "contentraw": "2 of 2 -<br />A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story) but it fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on.<br />(SIDE NOTE: Both the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.)<br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”).

Pick any major story of the past three years - e.g. Lab Leak, Jussie Smollett, Russiagate, Ukrainian Biolabs, Ivermectin, Hospitalizations From COVID v. With Covid, January 6th, ‘Transitory’ Inflation, and of course Hunter’s Laptop - and you will find absolutely hysterical narrative pushing up front followed by retractions, corrections, and outright denials as reality became undeniable. In the meanwhile, our civilization was ripped apart, our citizens were gaslit and impoverished, and in countries across the Western world, innocent people were removed from polite society, branded as lepers, and fired from their jobs. Why? Because there is one story that just won’t die and for which no corrections have been issued - the shibboleth that vaccination can prevent infection, transmission, and help “end” COVID.While there is never an excuse for hateful rhetoric towards, and intervention in, the personal medical choices of law-abiding Americans, perhaps one could have, kinda sorta, understood the campaign if the new vaccines had provided long-lasting immunity and prevented community transmission. They do not. Early on we were told: “Nine out of ten [vaccinated] people won’t get sick” (Columbia University feat. Run-DMC, February 12th, 2021, no this is not a joke); “Vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don`t get sick” (Dr. Rochelle Walensky, March 29th, 2021); “When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected” (Dr. Anthony Fauci, May 17th, 2021). And by mid-summer, 2021, we were still being told that unequivocally, these vaccines were a resounding success worthy of uncritical support. On July 27th in Scientific American, Dr. Eric Topol wrote, “Vaccination is the closest thing to a sure thing we have in this pandemic.” Not to be outdone, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the NIAID told CBS on August 1st, that the unvaccinated were responsible for “propagating this outbreak.” But on July 29th, 2021, the Washington Post reported a scoop that the CDC was privately acknowledging that the vaccinated could spread COVID as easily as the unvaccinated. Occasionally, they are forced to report inconvenient facts. And August 5th, CDC Director Walensky told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that, “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death — they prevent it. But what they can’t do anymore is prevent transmission.”[rest @ link] https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/insufferable-arrogance-constantly-wrong",

If thought through, it’s also a Biblical description of CULTS.Verse 2 is a Biblical description of a person who is the genuine article and not some fake like can be seen in verse 1.In verses 3 through 5, the “gatekeeper” is God the Father and the “for Him” part is a reference to Jesus. The “sheep” are, again, a Biblical description of a person who is the genuine article and not some fake.One is either in Jesus (100% forgiven - “Sheep”) or in Adam (0% forgiven - “Goats”). There is no such thing as a “Geep”: No one is ever “50% forgiven”. There will never again be another Calvary or Resurrection. No need. They were effective the first time. Both Matthew 25:31-46 as well as Galatians 6:15-16 are self-explanatory as to who “sheep” are as well as who “goats” are.A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story) but it fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on.(SIDE NOTE: Both the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.)By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:3-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm )  is only qualified to teach the new covenant. Forever’s a long time.JOHN 6:29 (GNT)Jesus answered, “What God wants you to do is to believe in the one he sent.”HEBREWS 10:14 (GNT)With one sacrifice, then, he has made perfect forever those who are purified from sin.https://www.biblegateway.com/",
