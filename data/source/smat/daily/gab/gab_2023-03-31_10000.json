On March 23, the Chicago Blackhawks decided against having players wear Pride-themed warmup jerseys for their upcoming Pride night, citing an anti-gay law in Russia.The Staal brothers and San Jose&#39;s James Reimer ‚Äî who are Canadian ‚Äî and Philadelphia&#39;s Ivan Provorov, who is Russian, all pointed to their religious beliefs for refusing to take part in warmups.&#39;We carry no judgement on how people choose to live their lives, and believe that all people should be welcome in all aspects of the game of hockey,&#39; Eric and Marc Staal said in a statement. &#39;Having said that, we feel that by us wearing a Pride jersey, it goes against our Christian beliefs.&#39;Nashville Predators prospect Luke Prokop, who in 2021 made history as the first player signed to an NHL contract to come out as gay, called the Pride night incidents a &#39;step back&#39; for hockey.Bettman addressed the issue last month.&#39;Whether or not you choose to embrace and make a statement on behalf of a cause affirmatively, if you choose not to do that, it doesn&#39;t necessarily make you a bigot,&#39; Bettman said last month. &#39;I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t endorse every single charity that solicits you, and you don&#39;t participate in every social cause.
