            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

            "description": "This group is based on \"Historical Revisionism\" so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal. That much is obvious!

Doughty agreed, finding the plaintiffs “have proven that Jennifer Psaki has personal knowledge about the issue concerning censorship across social media as it related to COVID-19 and ancillary issues of COVID-19.”He also said that “any burden on Psaki is outweighed by the need to determine whether free speech has been suppressed.”Psaki sought to quash the subpoena, saying it would unduly burden her because she would need to spend several days preparing for and participating in the deposition.Psaki filed the motion in federal court in Virginia, where she lives. Doughty is based in Louisiana.U.S. Magistrate Judge Ivan Davis of Virginia turned down Psaki’s request during a Nov. 18 hearing and transferred the motion to Doughty.Government lawyers then asked Doughty to quickly rule on the motion and, if he ruled against it, to stay the ruling while they appealed the ruling.In the new order, Doughty rejected the motion and the attempt to stay it.Doughty noted that he already acknowledged sitting for depositions would burden officials but pointed to federal rules that say people fighting subpoenas must prove an “undue burden,” not just a burden.“Having to prepare for the deposition and to give the deposition are examples of ‘burdens,’ not ‘undue burdens.’ Were the Court to find Psaki has an undue burden here, every person subject to a deposition subpoena would have grounds to quash,” Doughty said.“Preparing for and giving a deposition is part of the normal process for every person subpoenaed for a deposition. It is not an undue burden,” he added.Psaki had said in a declaration: “Sitting for a deposition in this matter would be extremely burdensome for me. Among other things, I understand that I would need to devote several days to preparing for the deposition, as well as attending the deposition itself, and that would be highly disruptive to both my work and my family.”Plaintiffs, including Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Republican Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, had said that Psaki’s motion should be rejected because her statements “only express the strongly-held desire by all deponents that they would rather be somewhere else.” Plaintiffs said they had already moved the deposition twice in an attempt to accommodate Psaki, minimizing any “logistical burden.”Motion for StayThe motion for a stay, meanwhile, stated that if Doughty rejected Psaki’s efforts, he should stay the order until an appeals court hands down its ruling on the matter.“Subjecting a high-ranking official to a deposition, which cannot later be reversed at a later stage of the litigation, establishes irreparable harm,” government lawyers said in a motion that was supported by Psaki.A stay pending appeal has four factors, including whether an applicant will be irreparably harmed without a stay.Doughty said that neither Psaki nor the government has shown they will likely succeed in their fight against the subpoena. He also said that because there is not an undue burden for Psaki, there is also no irreparable harm. The third factor doesn’t apply because there are no other parties at issue.“Fourth, the public interest lies in determining whether First Amendment free speech rights have been suppressed. Therefore, Psaki and Federal Defendants’ Motion to Stay Deposition is DENIED,” Doughty said.The ruling is the latest loss for the government, which has been trying to shield various former and current officials from answering questions under oath.Doughty recently denied a motion to quash the subpoena for Elvin Chan, an FBI agent based in California who has been described as being involved in communications that led to Facebook suppressing the original Hunter Biden laptop story.Doughty also turned down a request for a stay pending appeal of depositions of Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, a Biden appointee; Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly, a Biden appointee; and Rob Flaherty, a deputy assistant to the president.",
