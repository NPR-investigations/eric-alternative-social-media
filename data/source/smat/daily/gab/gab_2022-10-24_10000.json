We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",

But I’m with you today to talk about something very important. And that’s Eric Schmitt – he’s a fantastic attorney general; the job he’s done is incredible.”In August, Schmitt won the GOP nomination for the Missouri Senate race, edging out a field of Republican competitors. As previously reported by RSBN, Trump endorsed two candidates in the Senate ahead of that primary race by issuing an ambiguous endorsement: “I trust the Great People of Missouri, on this one, to make up their own minds, much as they did when they gave me landslide victories in the 2016 and 2020 Elections, and I am therefore proud to announce that ERIC has my Complete and Total Endorsement!”To clarify, both Attorney General Eric Schmitt and former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens faced off against each other in the Senate primary.Continuing his glowing remarks about Schmitt, Trump said, “He’s for protecting your state – and that is a great state.”“Missouri. I won it twice, and I love it, and we’ll always be with you,” the 45th president added. “But Eric wants to protect your border, he wants to lower your taxes, he wants to do all of the things that you have to have done. And number one, he wants to protect you from crime, and also from inflation, which is destroying our country.”He continued, “We have come so far down over the last two years, nobody’s seen anything like it…now you have Russia-Ukraine, which would have never happened. You have Taiwan, that’ll be next.”Trump also touched on the destruction of American energy independence and the Biden-led disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, drawing a comparison between the glory years of America First policies and today’s devastating politics.“What a disaster,” Trump remarked of the rising crime and chaos in America today.“Eric will NEVER ALLOW these things to happen,” Trump concluded. “He’ll fight for you, and he’ll fight hard. I’ve been with him for a long time. I’ve known him for a long time, and he’s a great guy for a great state. Vote for Eric Schmitt. As you know, he has my complete and total endorsement. Thank you.”",

Their families have been put into “It’s important to you people admit what they said was wrong? Cooper asked, “CBS reported on Sunday. “It’s important to me. It’s important to all the people whose families have been impacted by this. Anderson, my kids still are not allowed to get any package from the front door until we verify that it’s actually from a trusted sender,” Poulos said.Days after the 2020 presidential election, lawyers supporting then-President Donald Trump, including Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, began spreading unsubstantiated claims that Dominion Voting Systems, an American company, had rigged the election. They said Dominion was backed by Venezuela and that its machines and software switched millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.They never showed any evidence, but that didn’t stop pro-Trump attorneys from making baseless claims, or conservative news networks from giving them plenty of airtime,” CBS reported. Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit slammed Cooper, in his coverage of the program, for not showing journalist integrity enough to follow up with the questions about things that have been exposed about Dominion.Hoft showed that video footage has been available about the Dominion machines and vomiting systems, which should cause natural journalist scrutiny and raise questions of transparency with anyone who is looking for the truth.Here is more of Hoft’s coverage:“Poulos told a disinterested and gullible Anderson Cooper that Dominion machines cannot switch votes.Apparently, Anderson Cooper did not do his homework or he would have known Poulos is lying in a quick online search.There is video of 19,958 votes switched on election night from President Trump to Joe Biden in Pennsylvania.”On live TV exactly 19,958 votes taken from Trump and switched to Biden in Pennsylvania. Watch the PA totals change http://pic.twitter.com/TnBs7ZjUyW— robert mandry (@MandryRobert) November 10, 2020Hoft continued:“And we previously reported on two different videos of Dominion’s anti-Trump former executive Eric Coomer showing election officials how to switch votes.Dr. Eric Coomer who is responsible for the strategy and Security at Dominion Voting Systems.In 2016 Coomer told the Illinois States Board of Elections that it was possible to bypass election systems software.Here is more from the 2016 article at the Post and Email:Dr. Coomer’s statement brings to light a very serious issue all voters should understand. Voting systems must be re-certified each time they make changes to the hardware or software. Recertification is an expensive and time-consuming process. What Dr. Coomer told the Board is that Dominion Voting does not go back for recertification of software when threats to their code are discovered. Rather, they rely on post-election audits and providing advice to election jurisdictions about security. I have reviewed all of the recertification documents produced by Dominion, and I do not recall any software adjustments for security purposes.This is the reality of the security of your vote. Software systems that count and record the vote across Illinois and throughout the USA are not updated to address security problems, and even if they were, the software can be completely bypassed by going to the data tables that drive the systems.”And in 2017 Eric Coomer explained how to alter votes in the Dominion Voting Systems in a Chicago demonstration.A video turned up from 2017 where Dr. Eric Coomer from Dominion Voting explained to Chicago elections officials how to alter votes in the Dominion voting machines.This then is the SECOND VIDEO of top Dominion executive explaining to elections officials how to alter votes with the Dominion machines!This was a separate demonstration in the Chicago area (notice he is wearing a dark jacket and is without the wrist protector.)🤡2017 DR. ERIC COOMER EXPLAINS HOW TO ALTER VOTES IN THE DOMINION VOTING SYSTEM🙄THIS SEEMS ABSOLUTELY RIPE FOR FRAUD👿“Don’t worry about the election, Trump’s not gonna win.

          "content": "Court Orders Depositions of Top Biden Officials in Missouri AG’s CaseOctober 24, 2022Contact: Constituent ServicesOffice: 573-751-3321JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced today that the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana granted Missouri and Louisiana’s request for depositions from top-ranking officials in the federal government. This is movement in his lawsuit against top-ranking Biden Administration officials for allegedly colluding to suppress freedom of speech. The list of granted depositions includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, Director of White House Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, CISA Director Jen Easterly, and FBI Supervisory Special Agent Elvis Chan.“After finding documentation of a collusive relationship between the Biden Administration and social media companies to censor free speech, we immediately filed a motion to get these officials under oath,” said Attorney General Schmitt. “It is high time we shine a light on this censorship enterprise and force these officials to come clean to the American people, and this ruling will allow us to do just that. We’ll keep pressing for the truth.”The original lawsuit was filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry on May 5, 2022. Missouri and Louisiana filed a Motion for Expedited Preliminary Injunction-Related Discovery on June 17, 2022, and that motion was granted on July 12, 2022, clearing the way for Missouri and Louisiana to gather discovery and documents from Biden Administration officials and social media companies.The request for depositions was filed on October 10, 2022, and that motion was granted on October 21, 2022, allowing Missouri and Louisiana to depose top-ranking officials in the federal government under oath.The full ruling can be read here: https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/doc-90---order-regarding-witness-depositions.pdf?sfvrsn=24c99caa_2   ",

That changed Sunday night on 60 Minutes when Poulos sat down with Anderson Cooper, saying irreparable damage has been done to his company and his employees.“People have been put into danger. Their families have been put into danger. Their lives have been upended and all because of lies,” Poulos said. “It was a very clear calculation that they knew they were lies. And they were repeating them and endorsing them.”“It’s important to you people admit what they said was wrong? Cooper asked, “CBS reported on Sunday. “It’s important to me. It’s important to all the people whose families have been impacted by this. Anderson, my kids still are not allowed to get any package from the front door until we verify that it’s actually from a trusted sender,” Poulos said.Days after the 2020 presidential election, lawyers supporting then-President Donald Trump, including Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, began spreading unsubstantiated claims that Dominion Voting Systems, an American company, had rigged the election. They said Dominion was backed by Venezuela and that its machines and software switched millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.They never showed any evidence, but that didn’t stop pro-Trump attorneys from making baseless claims, or conservative news networks from giving them plenty of airtime,” CBS reported. Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit slammed Cooper, in his coverage of the program, for not showing journalist integrity enough to follow up with the questions about things that have been exposed about Dominion.Hoft showed that video footage has been available about the Dominion machines and vomiting systems, which should cause natural journalist scrutiny and raise questions of transparency with anyone who is looking for the truth.Here is more of Hoft’s coverage:“Poulos told a disinterested and gullible Anderson Cooper that Dominion machines cannot switch votes.Apparently, Anderson Cooper did not do his homework or he would have known Poulos is lying in a quick online search.There is video of 19,958 votes switched on election night from President Trump to Joe Biden in Pennsylvania.”On live TV exactly 19,958 votes taken from Trump and switched to Biden in Pennsylvania. Watch the PA totals change http://pic.twitter.com/TnBs7ZjUyW— robert mandry (@MandryRobert) November 10, 2020Hoft continued:“And we previously reported on two different videos of Dominion’s anti-Trump former executive Eric Coomer showing election officials how to switch votes.Dr. Eric Coomer who is responsible for the strategy and Security at Dominion Voting Systems.In 2016 Coomer told the Illinois States Board of Elections that it was possible to bypass election systems software.Here is more from the 2016 article at the Post and Email:Dr. Coomer’s statement brings to light a very serious issue all voters should understand. Voting systems must be re-certified each time they make changes to the hardware or software. Recertification is an expensive and time-consuming process. What Dr. Coomer told the Board is that Dominion Voting does not go back for recertification of software when threats to their code are discovered. Rather, they rely on post-election audits and providing advice to election jurisdictions about security. I have reviewed all of the recertification documents produced by Dominion, and I do not recall any software adjustments for security purposes.This is the reality of the security of your vote. Software systems that count and record the vote across Illinois and throughout the USA are not updated to address security problems, and even if they were, the software can be completely bypassed by going to the data tables that drive the systems.”And in 2017 Eric Coomer explained how to alter votes in the Dominion Voting Systems in a Chicago demonstration.A video turned up from 2017 where Dr. Eric Coomer from Dominion Voting explained to Chicago elections officials how to alter votes in the Dominion voting machines.This then ...........",

          "content": "David Eden Lane, #14Words: I have often pictured in my mind the reaction of my ancestors, in both Viking Scandinavia and Teutonic Europe, to the present-day tyranny of the Zionist Occupation Government (ZOG) of the United States.Can you, for instance, picture a 10th century Jerome Kurtz, former Jew head of the I.R.S., arriving at the longhut of one Eric the Fierce? Here, the kosher tax collector presents a document asserting that it is now the “Law” of the land that Eric and his clan must turn over half of their worldly possessions, and in the future must submit half of the fruits of their labor, to the tax collector. Furthermore, announces the tax collector, the tax money will be used to import Negroes and Mexicans as breeding stock to mix with your children. Is there anyone so naive as to doubt the certainty that the head of the forefather of Kosher Kurtz would soon have decorated a pole near the door of Eric’s abode, both as punishment for such impudence and as a warning to any of the parasitic tribe who might follow in his footsteps?Picture, if you can, a Teutonic tribe in Northern Europe in the 2nd century, headed by a chieftain named Balder. One day a certain Richard Cohen, head of the Civil Rights division of Northern Europe, arrives. Mr. Cohen announces that in a neighboring province, just two hours sleigh ride away, the government has created a village of imported Negroes. It is now the “Law” of the land, announces Mr. Cohen, that every member of your tribe must supply a sleigh and horses five days a week so we can transport your children to school in the new village of Ape-Eden. There your sons will be taught to feel guilty for being White, and your daughters will become the sexual attraction of the Negroes. To what avail, I wonder, would Mr. Cohen’s Civil Rights Laws have been when Balder cleaved the Jew from scalp to scrotum with his battle-axe?Now we, of course, would never advocate disobedience to the Jew laws of our land, but merely contemplate the differences between generations. Today’s conservatives have submitted to the things mentioned above, and worse. Furthermore, in the near future they will submit to far more degrading laws. When the laws come, as they will, that all remaining White men must pay for, and attend, a sensitivity training class, if they want to hold a job in the Jewnited States, they will arrive dutifully at the appointed place and time with money in hand. They will be wearing kneepads for crawling; they will have their ears pushed out like pistol grips, and they will have their lips puckered up like fish, and, quite literally, they will kiss the buttocks of the Jews’ assorted foot soldiers, for, after all, it will be the “Law.”When it becomes the “Law” of the land that every White man with a daughter between 12 and 17 years of age must bring her to an inter-racial, bi-sexual sensitivity class, he will obey – for it is the “Law.” There, his daughter will alternately be raped and brutalized by Negroes and bull dyke Jewesses, but the conservative can console himself with the knowledge that he obeyed the “Law.”It is now the “Law” that you must sell your Race in order to have a job. If you want a government job, you must agree to promote race-mixing. To get a license to sell real estate, you must agree to promote race-mixing. To be a teacher, or be recognized as a church, you must promote race-mixing. As a Race, we go to our death as responsible conservatives – obeying the “Law.”In the religion of our Norse and Teutonic ancestors, the highest duty and honor of a man was the protection of his kin and family, even unto death. Either we as a people will abandon the foolishness of an Oriental religion, i.e., “love your enemies,” “turn the other cheek,” “be meek and humble,” “resist not evil,” and return to the healthy laws of the Gods of our Fathers, or we and our civilization are dead and gone like the dodo bird. If we fail to do so, the last Whites, as they are being slaughtered by the Jewnited States Army and their Christian hand-maidens, can proudly proclaim to the end, “We obeyed the Law.”I must mention Don and Dan Nichols, the two so-called Mountain Men, who abducted a woman, intending to make her a wife for the younger Nichols. The problem they faced is common to hundreds of thousands of White men at this time. As the White men drop, or are forced, out of the system, many return to the mountains or forests which fit their racial soul. The White women, who are the most beautiful and most desired of all the females on this earth, however, are staying behind in the cities. https://racialrealism.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/it-is-the-law/",

Here, the kosher tax collector presents a document asserting that it is now the “Law” of the land that Eric and his clan must turn over half of their worldly possessions, and in the future must submit half of the fruits of their labor, to the tax collector. Furthermore, announces the tax collector, the tax money will be used to import Negroes and Mexicans as breeding stock to mix with your children. Is there anyone so naive as to doubt the certainty that the head of the forefather of Kosher Kurtz would soon have decorated a pole near the door of Eric’s abode, both as punishment for such impudence and as a warning to any of the parasitic tribe who might follow in his footsteps?Picture, if you can, a Teutonic tribe in Northern Europe in the 2nd century, headed by a chieftain named Balder. One day a certain Richard Cohen, head of the Civil Rights division of Northern Europe, arrives. Mr. Cohen announces that in a neighboring province, just two hours sleigh ride away, the government has created a village of imported Negroes. It is now the “Law” of the land, announces Mr. Cohen, that every member of your tribe must supply a sleigh and horses five days a week so we can transport your children to school in the new village of Ape-Eden. There your sons will be taught to feel guilty for being White, and your daughters will become the sexual attraction of the Negroes. To what avail, I wonder, would Mr. Cohen’s Civil Rights Laws have been when Balder cleaved the Jew from scalp to scrotum with his battle-axe?Now we, of course, would never advocate disobedience to the Jew laws of our land, but merely contemplate the differences between generations. Today’s conservatives have submitted to the things mentioned above, and worse. Furthermore, in the near future they will submit to far more degrading laws. When the laws come, as they will, that all remaining White men must pay for, and attend, a sensitivity training class, if they want to hold a job in the Jewnited States, they will arrive dutifully at the appointed place and time with money in hand. They will be wearing kneepads for crawling; they will have their ears pushed out like pistol grips, and they will have their lips puckered up like fish, and, quite literally, they will kiss the buttocks of the Jews’ assorted foot soldiers, for, after all, it will be the “Law.”When it becomes the “Law” of the land that every White man with a daughter between 12 and 17 years of age must bring her to an inter-racial, bi-sexual sensitivity class, he will obey – for it is the “Law.” There, his daughter will alternately be raped and brutalized by Negroes and bull dyke Jewesses, but the conservative can console himself with the knowledge that he obeyed the “Law.”It is now the “Law” that you must sell your Race in order to have a job. If you want a government job, you must agree to promote race-mixing. To get a license to sell real estate, you must agree to promote race-mixing. To be a teacher, or be recognized as a church, you must promote race-mixing. As a Race, we go to our death as responsible conservatives – obeying the “Law.”In the religion of our Norse and Teutonic ancestors, the highest duty and honor of a man was the protection of his kin and family, even unto death. Either we as a people will abandon the foolishness of an Oriental religion, i.e., “love your enemies,” “turn the other cheek,” “be meek and humble,” “resist not evil,” and return to the healthy laws of the Gods of our Fathers, or we and our civilization are dead and gone like the dodo bird. If we fail to do so, the last Whites, as they are being slaughtered by the Jewnited States Army and their Christian hand-maidens, can proudly proclaim to the end, “We obeyed the Law.”I must mention Don and Dan Nichols, the two so-called Mountain Men, who abducted a woman, intending to make her a wife for the younger Nichols. The problem they faced is common to hundreds of thousands of White men at this time. As the White men drop, or are forced, out of the system, many return to the mountains or forests which fit their racial soul. The White women, who are the most beautiful and most desired of all the females on this earth, however, are staying behind in the cities. https://racialrealism.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/it-is-the-law/",

When the bakers refuse to make the cakes, these activists sue under anti-discrimination laws, hoping to secure favorable legal precedents.In Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018), the Supreme Court sided with a Christian baker whom a gay couple had asked to create a custom cake to celebrate their union. A state human rights commission violated Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips’s First Amendment right to free exercise of religion by ruling against him, the court found. The high court will hear a similar case, 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, on Dec. 5.The new ruling (pdf) by Judge Eric Bradshaw of the Superior Court of California in Kern County came on Oct. 21 in Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) v. Cathy’s Creations Inc.DFEH claimed that Cathy Miller and Cathy’s Creations, which runs a small bakery called Tastries in Bakersfield, California, violated state civil rights law and discriminated against Eileen Rodriguez-del Rio and Mireya Rodriguez-del Rio because of their sexual orientation. The two were married in California in December 2016. Miller refused to bake a cake honoring their marriage, citing her sincerely held religious belief that marriage is intended to be between a man and a woman, but referred the couple to another bakery.But DFEH “failed to prove the discriminatory intent required” by state law, Bradshaw determined.“The evidence also affirmatively showed that defendants offered full and equal service to [the couple] by referring them to a comparable bakery,” he wrote.Miller’s “pure and expressive speech is entitled to protection under the First Amendment.” The baking of a wedding cake by Tastries is “labor-intensive” and “artistic,” according to Bradshaw.DFEH is “barred by defendants’ right to Free Speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution from enforcing the [state law] to compel or prohibit defendants’ speech.”“We applaud the court for this decision,” one of Miller’s lawyers, Charles LiMandri, partner at LiMandri and Jonna, said in a statement.“The freedom to practice one’s religion is enshrined in the First Amendment, and the United States Supreme Court has long upheld the freedom of artistic expression,” said LiMandri, who’s also special counsel to the Thomas More Society, the public interest law firm that acted for Miller’s.“There’s a certain irony there that a law intended to protect individuals from religious discrimination was used to discriminate against Cathy for her religious beliefs,” said Paul Jonna, who’s also a partner at LiMandri and Jonna and special counsel to the Thomas More Society.Jonna said Miller has mainstream Christian beliefs that are entitled to be respected by the courts.“Cathy believes in the Bible,” he said in a statement. “The state was actually questioning the sincerity of Cathy’s faith.”Jonna noted that Tastries is adorned with Christian decor and plays Christian music over its sound system.“The fact that they called Miller’s open and sincerely held beliefs into question is almost as disturbing as quibbling over her status as an artist,” he said.The Epoch Times reached out to DFEH for comment but didn’t receive a reply as of press time.https://www.theepochtimes.com/california-judge-refuses-to-force-christian-baker-to-make-wedding-cake-celebrating-same-sex-marriage_4815159.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",

          "content": "A federal court ordered on Oct. 21 that Dr. Anthony Fauci and other top officials testify under oath at depositions in a case that has uncovered evidence of alleged federal government collusion with Big Tech companies to censor users.The attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri and other plaintiffs allege that Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, and other defendants colluded and coerced social media companies to “suppress disfavored speakers, viewpoints, and content” regarding COVID-19.U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty went a step further than a previous ruling that forced written testimonies and ordered Fauci and other defendants to testify under oath at depositions.“After finding documentation of a collusive relationship between the Biden Administration and social media companies to censor free speech, we immediately filed a motion to get these officials under oath,” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement.“It is high time we shine a light on this censorship enterprise and force these officials to come clean to the American people, and this ruling will allow us to do just that. We’ll keep pressing for the truth.”The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) joined the lawsuit in August, representing renowned epidemiologists Drs. Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, as well as Dr. Aaron Kheriaty and Jill Hines.NCLA attorney Jenin Younes said she looks forward to learning just how far the accused government officials went to push their COVID-19 “perspective.”“For the first time, Dr. Fauci and seven other federal officials responsible for running an unlawful censorship enterprise will have to answer questions under oath about the nature and extent of their communications with tech companies,” Younes said in a statement to The Epoch Times.Doughty also ordered the depositions of former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, White House Director of Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy,  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly, and FBI Supervisory Special Agent Elvis Chan.Fauci’s ‘Self-Serving Blanket Denials’In his ruling, Doughty said he agreed with plaintiffs that Fauci’s previous “self-serving blanket denials” about his role in censoring views on social media couldn’t be taken at face value.“Plaintiffs argue that even if Dr. Fauci can prove he never communicated with social media platforms about censorship, there are compelling reasons that suggest Dr. Fauci has acted through intermediaries, and acted on behalf of others, in procuring the social-media censorship of credible scientific opinions,” Doughty said in his ruling (pdf). “Plaintiffs argue that even if Dr. Fauci acted indirectly or as an intermediary on behalf of others, it is still relevant to Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion. The Court agrees.“Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Fauci’s credibility has been in question on matters related to supposed COVID-19 ‘misinformation’ since 2020. Specifically, Plaintiffs state that Dr. Fauci has made public statements on the efficacy of masks, the percentage of the population needed for herd immunity, NIAID’s funding of ‘gain-of-function’ virus research in Wuhan, the lab-leak theory, and more.“Plaintiffs urge that his comments on these important issues are relevant to the matter at hand and are further reasons why Dr. Fauci should be deposed. Plaintiffs assert that they should not be required to simply accept Dr. Fauci’s ‘self-serving blanket denials’ that were issued from someone other than himself at face value. The Court agrees.”Censoring Lab Leak TheoryThe plaintiffs argued that Fauci allegedly insisted on the censorship of “speech backed by great scientific credibility and with enormous potential nationwide impact” that contradicted his views.For example, he communicated in a long-shielded phone call with some scientists to discredit any theory that COVID-19 was the result of a “lab leak” in Wuhan, China. The scientists went on to write a paper severely reprimanding others who were open to the theory.If the lab leak theory were true, in turn, it would mean that Fauci could be potentially implicated in funding the research on viruses that caused the COVID-19 pandemic that killed millions of people worldwide, the plaintiffs argued. This is because he funded risky “gain-of-function” research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology through intermediaries such as EcoHealth Alliance.[Click on my reply for rest of article]https://www.theepochtimes.com/judge-orders-fauci-psaki-top-officials-be-deposed-in-big-tech-censorship-case_4813336.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",

          "content": "The Republicans could see large gains in both chambers of Congress in November, according to Epoch Times contributor and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.“I would say we’ll be between plus three and plus seven … in the Senate; and we’ll be between plus 20 and plus 50 in the House, with the most likely number being plus 44,” Gingrich told The Epoch Times.The GOP needs to flip five seats to win back House control. In the evenly-divided Senate, Republicans need to win one more seat to claim the majority.With the November election day fast approaching, Democratic optimism appears to be fading as GOP candidates close in on key races across the country.In New Hampshire, Republican challenger Don Bolduc has narrowed the gap between him and Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan down to 2 points, according to an Oct. 20 poll by GOP pollster Fabrezio, Lee and Associates, well within the 4 percent margin of error. The poll, which was commissioned by Bolduc’s campaign, placed Hassan at 49 percent to Buldoc’s 47 percent.In Arizona, the Trump-backed Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters is gaining ground after earlier stumbles. Polling data aggregator RealClearPolitics predicts the state to be a tossup, and gives the Democrat incumbent only a 2.5-point lead.In Pennsylvania, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman’s double-digit edge has evaporated in recent weeks. A recent AARP Pennsylvania poll conducted by Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research showed Fetterman with a 48 percent to 46 percent lead, which is within the margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.In Georgia, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock’s lead over the Republican nominee Herschel Walker is sliding too. A recent Landmark Communication poll had the two tied at 46 percent, while an InsiderAdvantage survey showed Warnock only 2 points ahead, within the margin of error of 4.2 percent.“Almost everywhere in the country, races are showing the Republicans tightening up,” said Gingrich. And according to him, Democrats have only themselves to blame.Key Voter ConcernsCrime, inflation, border security, and “woke policies,” he said, all “coming together” against Democrats’ favor.“When you have sort of insane left-wing Democrats who believe that you don’t need prisons and that things can be dealt with by just being nice to murderers, I think the average person just thinks this is crazy,” he said, pointing to the crime concerns in New York as an example.For gubernatorial candidate Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), who has made crime a campaign focus, the issue hit close to home on Oct. 9 when a shooting wounded two minors outside of his front porch with Zeldin’s two 16-year-old daughters inside the house. Zeldin, who was out campaigning at the time, said that one bullet landed 30 feet away from the kitchen table where his two teenage daughters were doing homework.With near-daily press conferences to highlight the city’s crime crisis and his opponent’s failure to address it, Zeldin’s been closing in on Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul in the gubernatorial contest, with the gap tightening to low single digits, positioning him for a potential upset victory in a deep blue state.Hochul, facing political pressure, on Oct. 22 announced a plan with New York City Mayor Eric Adams to hire another 1,200 officers to address transit crime.Inflation, crime, and immigration are Republicans’ key campaign issues. In a handful of recent polls, voters appear to find them their biggest concerns at the moment.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Oct. 18 claimed that a New York Times/Siena poll showing that the economy and inflation ranked as voters’ top two concerns was an “outlier,” and that abortion is on top of voters’ minds.“I can tell you that women’s concerns about their freedom are very, very much still very significant in terms of how they will vote,” she told MSNBC. “It’s a matter of who turns out to vote,” she said, adding that she feels “pretty good” about her party’s chances.Abortion Issue Not Paying Off for DemocratsThe abortion issue, however, is unlikely to help the Democrats as much as Pelosi and other Democratics may think, according to Gingrich.“Republicans are actually winning the argument, because it’s a question of who’s the more extreme,” he said.The former speaker pointed to the position of Warnock, the Democratic senator from Georgia who has described himself as a “pro-choice pastor.” Warnock has sought to portray his challenger Walker’s pro-life stance as extreme, but has himself remained silent on whether he supports any limits on abortion. Walker said during an Oct. 14 debate that he agrees with the state’s law that prohibits abortion after six weeks, and allows exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.[Click on my replies below for rest od article]https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-gop-could-gain-up-to-7-seats-in-senate-50-seats-in-house-gingrich_4814897.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",

Zeldin, who was out campaigning at the time, said that one bullet landed 30 feet away from the kitchen table where his two teenage daughters were doing homework.<br /><br />With near-daily press conferences to highlight the city’s crime crisis and his opponent’s failure to address it, Zeldin’s been closing in on Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul in the gubernatorial contest, with the gap tightening to low single digits, positioning him for a potential upset victory in a deep blue state.<br /><br />Hochul, facing political pressure, on Oct. 22 announced a plan with New York City Mayor Eric Adams to hire another 1,200 officers to address transit crime.<br /><br />Inflation, crime, and immigration are Republicans’ key campaign issues. In a handful of recent polls, voters appear to find them their biggest concerns at the moment.<br /><br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Oct. 18 claimed that a New York Times/Siena poll showing that the economy and inflation ranked as voters’ top two concerns was an “outlier,” and that abortion is on top of voters’ minds.<br /><br />“I can tell you that women’s concerns about their freedom are very, very much still very significant in terms of how they will vote,” she told MSNBC. “It’s a matter of who turns out to vote,” she said, adding that she feels “pretty good” about her party’s chances.<br /><br />Abortion Issue Not Paying Off for Democrats<br /><br />The abortion issue, however, is unlikely to help the Democrats as much as Pelosi and other Democratics may think, according to Gingrich.<br /><br /><br />“Republicans are actually winning the argument, because it’s a question of who’s the more extreme,” he said.<br /><br />The former speaker pointed to the position of Warnock, the Democratic senator from Georgia who has described himself as a “pro-choice pastor.” Warnock has sought to portray his challenger Walker’s pro-life stance as extreme, but has himself remained silent on whether he supports any limits on abortion. Walker said during an Oct. 14 debate that he agrees with the state’s law that prohibits abortion after six weeks, and allows exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.<br /><br />[Click on my replies below for rest od article]<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-gop-could-gain-up-to-7-seats-in-senate-50-seats-in-house-gingrich_4814897.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theepochtimes.com/exclusive-gop-could-gain-up<span class=\"invisible\">-to-7-seats-in-senate-50-seats-in-house-gingrich_4814897.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
