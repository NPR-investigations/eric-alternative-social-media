With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election. Each one has varying views on the 2020 election between then-President Trump and current President Biden.

If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process.

With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. <br /><br />In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.<br /><br />These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.<br /><br />Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election. Each one has varying views on the 2020 election between then-President Trump and current President Biden. <br /><br />WATCH NOW:<br /><br />'2000 Mules' trailer: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5c69MN8qpEI\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>youtu.be/5c69MN8qpEI<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />'2000 Mules' website:  <a href=\"https://2000mules.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>2000mules.com<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election. Each one has varying views on the 2020 election between then-President Trump and current President Biden.

With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election. Each one has varying views on the 2020 election between then-President Trump and current President Biden.

With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election. Each one has varying views on the 2020 election between then-President Trump and current President Biden.

With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election. Each one has varying views on the 2020 election between then-President Trump and current President Biden.

With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election.

With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election. Each one has varying views on the 2020 election between then-President Trump and current President Biden.

With resources from True The Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht, D‚ÄôSouza sees security footage that exposes something shocking at ballot boxes across these key states. In Georgia for example, True the Vote alleges there were 242 traffickers who made 5,662 trips to ballot drop boxes between the early morning hours of 12AM and 5AM, potentially unloading hundreds of thousands of illegally harvested ballots over the course of several weeks.These 5 states showed more illegal votes from this strategy alone than Biden‚Äôs winning margin, based on True the Vote‚Äôs high bar in defining a mule (at least 10 visits to drop boxes). If the bar is lowered to count those making at least 5 visits, the estimated affected votes increases by more than double.Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza takes you on a journey through the voting process. D‚ÄôSouza speaks with several heavy hitters from Conservative media including Charlie Kirk, Eric Metaxes, Dennis Prager, Sebastian Gorka, Larry Elder, and others on the 2020 election.

Click to ask your U.S. House Representative to Support HR419, which would defund the WHO and call your local U.S. Senator asking them to do their job to offer oversight so that the current administration does not destroy our U.S. constitution when it comes to public health.

Click to ask your U.S. House Representative to Support HR419, which would defund the WHO and call your local U.S. Senator asking them to do their job to offer oversight so that the current administration does not destroy our U.S. constitution when it comes to public health.
