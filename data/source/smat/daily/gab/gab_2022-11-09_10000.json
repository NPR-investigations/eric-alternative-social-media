Stop The Steal movements have become a target of the media and platforms like Facebook have banned any mention of STS, so naturally this group could become a target of agent provocateurs.

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

According to the documents, the “service providers” that have seen such illegals placed in their care are in Texas and Arizona.The findings further highlight the Biden Administration’s open-borders and pro-amnesty immigration policy, which he has enacted since rising to power. In addition to severely reducing enforcement of existing immigration laws, the Biden Administration has gone out of its way to provide taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals, something that Biden promised he would do on the campaign trail.He previously vowed to provide illegals with taxpayer-funded healthcare, housing, and education, among other benefits; this move is widely seen as a political ploy meant to pander to illegals, to ensure that they will vote for the Democratic Party once they are given amnesty and subsequently are allowed to vote in American elections.",

While Maxey has been talking about these connections for some time, the story has been largely overlooked.He explained the connection between the first son and the Wuhan lab during an appearance on the “Sovereign Soul Show”:“Let’s go back to COVID. Literally, Hunter Biden and his partners raised millions of dollars from Metabiota. Metabiota was a privatized company that the U.S. intelligence used to run the biolabs in Ukraine which I have uncovered, [they are] also deeply involved inside the Wuhan lab,” Maxey claims.“You can find papers written by Metabiota describing them as bat and corona experts. And Hunter had a secretary in Beijing, named Xiaoyang, her last name is Zeng, spelled Z E N G, and her husband is a guy named Fu Gao, or George Gao, senior, top guy in the Chinese CDC. And Hunter hooks this guy up with Metabiota, and they essentially run the gain of function experiments inside the Wuhan lab that gave us COVID!” he added.“U.S. intel and disgusting characters like Tony Fauci et al. are just as responsible for the COVID outbreak as the Chinese Communists because we off-shored their Frankenstein experiments to China because they weren’t under law allowed to engage in these experiments inside the United States,” Maxey charged.“And they went completely rogue, and now millions of people around the world lost their lives; the economy of the world lost trillions and trillions of lost opportunities, family businesses destroyed: these people need to be held to account,” he said.The outlet noted further:A little research into the connection between Metabiota and the bat and corona research can confirm Maxey’s claims. See here for a 2017 study on bats and coronaviruses with Metabiota involvement; as well as another here.By August of this year, Maxey had already developed and presented his thesis quite extensively.At a political rally in Bloomsburg, Pa., Aug. 27, Maxey called Metabiota “the prime contractor inside all these Ukrainian labs.” He then cited a specific email that he discovered on Hunter Biden’s laptop “between Eric Schwerin, Hunter’s broker-dealer manager and Hunter [Biden], which says: ‘Hunter, we gotta get a hold of Xiaoying’s husband, because I think he and the CDC could be really helpful for Metabiota.’”“Xiaoying, as it turns out this woman’s name: Xiaoying Zeng – or Zung, as they pronounce it, it is spelled Z E N G – she is a daughter inside the major Shanghai – CCP crime family, called the Zungs, who runs something called the ‘Shanghai clique’, and they have a lot of overlaps in Shanghai with another group called the – surprise – ‘oil clique,'” Maxey continued at the rally.“And, guess what, her husband is a guy named Fu Gao or George Gao, trained either at Oxford or Cambridge, [who] spent a bunch of years in the United States, and he is a top guy at the Chinese CDC,” he added, going on to explain that Metabiota “was created by U.S. intelligence.”Well, like everything else under President [George W.] Bush, they realized that by privatizing it, somebody could get rich. So they created Metabiota,” he claimed. “It is sort of like Blackwater, right? And Metabiota is the prime contractor inside all those Ukrainian labs that they now admit that there are 20 some of them.”https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-11-08-shocking-connection-hunter-biden-ukraine-biolabs-origin-of-covid-pandemic.html",

You are helping the CFR &amp; their 1% ruling elite deep state cohorts in other nations to make the US part of a 1% ruling elite international ruling order. An order where the rules of God and natural law are replaced by 1% ruling elite rules and which the lower working class folk will have to live by even if they are against their religious values and which can be used to prevent their right to free speech by branding their speech as hate speech. Proud of yourself Jimbo? BTW have you blocked or muted me yet. You never respond to anything I have to say. Is that because you have no way to counter what I am saying?",

Proud of yourself Jimbo? BTW have you blocked or muted me yet. You never respond to anything I have to say. Is that because you have no way to counter what I am saying?<br />.",

Once Marco Antonio Rubio had to dispute with Trump at the Republican Party Congress, and now he is snapping back to support Trump, Will there be any conspiracy?Is Marco Antonio Rubio really Trump's \"people around\" or not?Former U.S. President Donald Trump was previously raided by the FBI, which searched former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to investigate whether he brought classified records from the White House to his residence in Florida.Dozens of U.S. FBI agents executed a raid on Trump's residence at the Sea Lake estate and took 10 to 15 boxes of documents. Trump said in a statement that the FBI agents even opened his personal safe during the search.While the FBI and the U.S. Federal Department of Justice have remained silent on the cause of the incident, a large number of U.S. media outlets as well as Trump's son Eric have said that it is related to the alleged violation of the Presidential Records Act for the documents Trump brought from the White House to the Sea Lake estate. This means that Trump may have allegedly violated the U.S. Counterintelligence Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, and may even add up to another 20 years for obstruction of justice.Many Americans are currently excitedly speculating about the identity of this person who denounced Trump. And from the British \"Independent\" report on the matter, some quite disgusted Trump's American Internet celebrity, social celebrities and ordinary netizens, but also took the opportunity to disgust up the Trump side, flirting that the person who denounced Trump is likely to be his closest family members around.However, Marco Antonio Rubio, who had been in a tit-for-tat relationship with Trump everywhere before, was also included in the suspect.

I think that in this case, Trump will be arrested and imprisoned, so it must be the people who are usually opposite to Trump.Mrs.Rubio had been attacked by Trump and swallow humiliation and bear a heavy loadTrump previously posted a tweet accusing Rubio's campaign of using nude photos of his wife to smear himself, according to the UK's Daily Mail website.Trump said: \"Marco Antonio Rubio who loves to lie actually used a photo taken by my wife in GQ magazine to make discredit my campaign advertisement.
