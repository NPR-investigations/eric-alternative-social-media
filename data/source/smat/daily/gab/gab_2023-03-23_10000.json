          "content": "3/23/23 The Rise and Fall of ERIChttp://www.liberato.us/commentary.htmlRecent news shows it‚Äôs possible to undo the Democrats‚Äô weaponization of our elections apparatus.  Florida, Missouri, and West Virginia joined Louisiana and Alabama in leaving ERIC, the voter registration data clearinghouse conservatives say is really a get-out-the-vote drive for Democrats.  ERIC is the Electronic Registration Information Center, initially funded with George Soros money [more documentation here] and, until recently, overseen by a high-profile Democrat election lawyer.  ERIC is supposed to help member states scrub their voter rolls of deceased and moved-away voters, but one of the complaints is that ERIC does a bad job, leaving the rolls bloated and elections vulnerable to fraud as a result.  Ohio and Iowa are the latest states to leave ERIC.  Alaska and Texas may follow.  States are leaving for many reasons.  One of the reasons Louisiana gave was the overall Democrat tilt to the entire operation.  Alabama was worried about a private group having access to voter data, among other things.  Ohio had asked for changes and left when none were forthcoming.  At this point, ERIC only serves the interests of the Democrats, Ohio‚Äôs Secretary of State said in a letter. These are not the only problems with ERIC.  It recently came to light ERIC has been sharing data with a left-wing nonprofit - the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) - run by the very same high-profile Democrat election lawyer mentioned earlier (David Becker) who founded and only recently departed ERIC.  The data pinpointed likely Democrat voters who had not yet registered to vote so they could be targeted for partisan registration drives.  As if illicit data sharing were not enough, ERIC also restricts states from acting against noncitizens registered to vote and tells states to keep their list maintenance data secret even though federal law requires it be made public.  Other critics point out states are legally obligated to maintain their voter rolls and nothing in law allows them to outsource that function to outside private third parties, to begin with.  In addition, according to an election integrity activist in my network, ERIC also requires member states to move to \"online only\" voter registration to eliminate signed voter registration documents.  This completely frustrates signature verification requirements between registration documents and mail-in ballots in those states that require such verification.  Still other critics reinforce the perception, stated at the outset, that ERIC is far more effective at identifying potential voters for the Democrats than keeping the voter rolls up to date.  States are scrambling for alternatives.  Texas is developing an interstate crosscheck system to eliminate duplicate registrations.

We will remove a post according to our interpretation (written by us) of the guidelines below. If there is any confusion, please DM.***My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God‚Äôs mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.‚Äù Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n\r\n***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING: Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n\r\n***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else's well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? \r\n\r\nWith that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.\r\n\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n\r\n***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n\r\n***‚ÄúThe Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. ‚ÄúSo shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.‚Äù Numbers 6:24-27 ESV\r\n\r\n***Group Creator:  @Micaiah\r\nAdmins/Mods: @Shooglenifty, @riustan",

The new trove of emails unearthed by a lawsuit against the Archives shows Biden and Hunter coordinated through their respective associates in response to questions from reporters about if Hunter‚Äôs position on Burisma‚Äôs board undermined then-Vice President Biden‚Äôs credibility in pushing anti-corruption measures.In April 2014, Hunter joined the board of Burisma, just two years before Joe Biden stated he forced the firing of Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. Despite Hunter‚Äôs lack of experience in Ukraine or the energy sector, he was paid $83,000 per month by the energy company, or $1 million per year ‚Äî just weeks after his father was announced ‚Äúpoint person‚Äù on U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.Emails previously released from the Archives show Hunter advised the Office of Vice President Biden in 2014 on how to handle media inquiries regarding his position on the board of Burisma, a potential violation of federal law due to Hunter failing to register as a foreign agent.That trend appears to have continued well into 2015 when Kate Bedingfield, Biden‚Äôs former communications director, told Hunter‚Äôs top financial lieutenant Eric Schwerin via email that Joe Biden approved a statement regarding Hunter‚Äôs board position.Notably, Bedingfield departed the White House in 2023 just as the House Oversight Committee probe into Joe Biden heated up.‚ÄúVP signed off on this ‚Äî will give this quote to reporters in my name shortly,‚Äù she said, including the quote below in the email:‚ÄúHunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer.

The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party‚Äôs founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party‚Äôs first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party‚Äôs first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party‚Äôs presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party‚Äôs national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party‚Äôs Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer‚Äôs Party to ‚ÄúConstitution Party‚Äù to better reflect the party‚Äôs primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‚Äòalternative‚Äô parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode‚Äôs running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle‚Äôs running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

Dirty Democrats will do anything to destroy this country.They‚Äôve proven all of this is true with the looming indictment and arrest of President Donald Trump on ‚Äútrumped up‚Äù charges. They‚Äôve proven Democrat DA‚Äôs funded by George Soros, combined with Democrat judges and Democrat grand juries, in a deep blue city, filled with liberal loonies and thugs with  ‚ÄúTrump Derangement Syndrome,‚Äù can indict a ham sandwich (as the saying goes).But the real problem is Republicans are weak, feckless, cowards who bring knives to gun fights. Actually, the GOP is more likely to bring golf clubs and a white flag to a gunfight. Our team is afraid of their own shadow and unwilling to hit back hard.The time for being nice and gentlemanly is over. Any indictment, arrest and arraignment of Trump is a declaration of war. They want a war. Let‚Äôs give them a war. And I know how to fight back. Legally.The Soros-funded Democrat scumbag DA of Manhattan‚Ä¶who lets violent criminals walk without bail‚Ä¶even murderers and rapists and attempted cop killers‚Ä¶who has presided over a massive crime wave that has turned Manhattan into a killing field‚Ä¶wants to indict and arrest the former President of the United States, for a 17-year old crime that was never a crime‚Ä¶well beyond the statute of limitations‚Ä¶and out of jurisdiction. So why not do the exact same thing to Democrats?I‚Äôm looking for a few brilliant, ambitious, conservative, patriot DAs and Attorney Generals around the country with cajones. Willing to do the same exact thing to Democrats, as Democrats are doing to Trump. Here is what red city DAs and red state AGs must do‚Ä¶*Indict, arrest and perp walk Hillary Clinton for her crimes. Including the same supposed crime as Trump- campaign finance violations. She used campaign funds to frame Trump for Russian collusion. Hillary has already admitted guilt. Her campaign paid a $115,000 fine.Now it‚Äôs time to indict her in Texas for her crimes. Or Florida. Or Alabama. Or any red city, or red state with cajones.*Indict Obama. He illegally spied on Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign and then on the Trump White House. That‚Äôs treason. Any red state DAs or AGs willing to indict, arrest and perp walk Obama? Why not? He‚Äôs a real criminal. He‚Äôs a traitor to our country.*Indict Bill Clinton. He paid off Paula Jones to coverup an affair. It‚Äôs about sex‚Ä¶it‚Äôs beyond the statute of limitations‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs not a local issue in Texas or Florida. Perfect! It matches this Trump indictment. Extradite Bill to Texas for arraignment.*Indict George Soros. For conspiracy to overthrow USA by funding the open borders invasion and funding woke Marxist DAs who have unleashed a crime wave upon our once great nation.*Indict Eric Holder. He was never prosecuted or punished in any way for committing ‚ÄúContempt of Congress.‚Äù*Indict Mark Zuckerberg. For using $400 million of ‚ÄúZuckerbucks‚Äù to rig and steal the 2020 election.*Indict Nancy Pelosi. For committing fraud and entrapment upon thousands of peaceful protestors on January 6.*Indict Dr. Fauci for mass murder. Do I need to say a thing?*Indict Hunter Biden. For at least 100 federal crimes- including bribery and extortion of foreign governments, on behalf of Vice President Biden.*Of course, Indict Hunter‚Äôs dad Joe. For being ‚Äúthe Big Guy.‚Äù Biden extorted money from China and Ukraine as Vice President. He betrayed the citizens of America and disgraced his office. And to top it off, I‚Äôm betting he committed tax evasion- the same crime as Al Capone. All that money went into offshore accounts. I guarantee you he didn‚Äôt pay taxes.*Lastly, indict Biden, Kamala and Mayorkas. For dereliction of duty, reckless endangerment, and treason for intentionally leaving the border open, and encouraging the illegal foreign invasion of the United States of America.Trump did nothing wrong. But these are all REAL crimes, serious crimes, treason. It‚Äôs time for red city DAs and red state AGs to step up and indict all these dirty Democrat traitors.It‚Äôs time to go nuclear. You want a war, we‚Äôre gonna give you a war. It‚Äôs time for balls, cajones, and big boy pants. Two can play at this game.All of those crimes above are federal crimes, not city, or state.Most are long past the statute of limitations.Just like the Trump case. It‚Äôs time for Democrats to swallow their own medicine.Indict a few of these dirty Democrats and watch Soros funded DA Alvin Bragg drop the Trump case in a New York minute. End of story.",

It‚Äôs about sex‚Ä¶it‚Äôs beyond the statute of limitations‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs not a local issue in Texas or Florida. Perfect! It matches this Trump indictment. Extradite Bill to Texas for arraignment.<br /><br />*Indict George Soros. For conspiracy to overthrow USA by funding the open borders invasion and funding woke Marxist DAs who have unleashed a crime wave upon our once great nation.<br /><br />*Indict Eric Holder. He was never prosecuted or punished in any way for committing ‚ÄúContempt of Congress.‚Äù<br /><br />*Indict Mark Zuckerberg. For using $400 million of ‚ÄúZuckerbucks‚Äù to rig and steal the 2020 election.<br /><br />*Indict Nancy Pelosi. For committing fraud and entrapment upon thousands of peaceful protestors on January 6.<br /><br />*Indict Dr. Fauci for mass murder. Do I need to say a thing?<br /><br />*Indict Hunter Biden. For at least 100 federal crimes- including bribery and extortion of foreign governments, on behalf of Vice President Biden.<br /><br />*Of course, Indict Hunter‚Äôs dad Joe. For being ‚Äúthe Big Guy.‚Äù Biden extorted money from China and Ukraine as Vice President. He betrayed the citizens of America and disgraced his office. And to top it off, I‚Äôm betting he committed tax evasion- the same crime as Al Capone. All that money went into offshore accounts. I guarantee you he didn‚Äôt pay taxes.<br /><br />*Lastly, indict Biden, Kamala and Mayorkas. For dereliction of duty, reckless endangerment, and treason for intentionally leaving the border open, and encouraging the illegal foreign invasion of the United States of America.<br /><br />Trump did nothing wrong. But these are all REAL crimes, serious crimes, treason. It‚Äôs time for red city DAs and red state AGs to step up and indict all these dirty Democrat traitors.<br /><br />It‚Äôs time to go nuclear. You want a war, we‚Äôre gonna give you a war. It‚Äôs time for balls, cajones, and big boy pants. Two can play at this game.<br /><br />All of those crimes above are federal crimes, not city, or state.<br /><br />Most are long past the statute of limitations.<br /><br />Just like the Trump case. It‚Äôs time for Democrats to swallow their own medicine.<br /><br />Indict a few of these dirty Democrats and watch Soros funded DA Alvin Bragg drop the Trump case in a New York minute. End of story.",
