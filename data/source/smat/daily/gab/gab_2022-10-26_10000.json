Our goal is to present and show the real NSDAP as it really truly was. The Hollywood version is a lie and everything we learned in school is a lie. Even our current media is a lie. So if you are browsing through this group, join us and you'll see that what we present here is very different from what you will see out there in other social networks. Why? We show you the real truth! Not propaganda and lies.

That way the Kikes can't evade them.

We hope to add more backup groups here, so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here. We can never have too many backup groups.

We will remove a post according to our interpretation (written by us) of the guidelines below. If there is any confusion, please DM.\n***My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” Ephesians 3:20 TPT\n\n***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING: Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\n\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\n\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\n\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \n\n***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else's well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? \n\nWith that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\n1. Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\n\n2. Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.\n\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\n\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \n\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\n\n***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\n\n***“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.” Numbers 6:24-27 ESV\n\n***Group Creator:  @Micaiah\nAdmins/Mods: @Shooglenifty, @riustan",

It doesn't matter what woke politicians like Kathy Hochul and Eric Adams, or woke publications like The New York Times, say. When you actually fight for your beliefs, instead of being cowed into silence, you're much more likely to win. Excerpt:New York City’s controversial COVID-19 vaccine mandate for municipal workers was enacted illegally and employees who were fired for refusing to comply must be immediately reinstated with back pay, a state judge has ruled.“It is time for the City of New York to do what is right and what is just,” Staten Island Supreme Court Justice Ralph Porzio wrote in a decision made public Tuesday.More than 1,750 city workers were fired for refusing to get vaccinated, including 36 members of the NYPD and more than 950 Department of Education employees.In his 13-page ruling, Porzio said then-city Health Commissioner David Chokshi’s Oct. 20, 2021, order “violates the separation of powers doctrine” enshrined in the state constitution.Chokshi also violated the workers’ “substantive and procedural due process rights” and didn’t have “the power and authority to permanently exclude [them] from their workplace,” Porzio said.And Chokshi’s order, another that extended the mandate to private employers and a related executive order issued by Mayor Eric Adams were “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of state law, the judge said. Adams’ March 24 executive order exempted athletes and performing artists from the vaccine mandate.“The vaccination mandate for City employees was not just about safety and public health; it was about compliance,” Porzio wrote.“If it was about safety and public health, unvaccinated workers would have been placed on leave the moment the order was issued. If it was about safety and public health, the Health Commissioner would have issued city-wide mandates for all residents.”Porzio also noted the Big Apple’s “nearly 80% vaccination rate” before saying that “we shouldn’t be penalizing the people who showed up to work, at great risk to themselves and their families, while we were locked down.”https://nypost.com/2022/10/25/judge-tosses-nyc-vaccine-mandate-orders-workers-backpay/",

The 84th district consists of Greenfield, Hales corners, and parts of Milwaukee.Clearly, the main Wisconsin focus has been on the big three races, Ron Johnson, Tim Michels, and Eric Toney. But, if we are able to sweep the big races, we MUST have Bob Donovan in the Assembly, because Milwaukee will be a major factor in turning our state around.For years, Donovan was a conservative firebrand on the Milwaukee Common Council This makes him uniquely qualified to bridge the Wisconsin state government with the City of Milwaukee Government.As Tim Michels said in his debate with Tony Evers, ‘Milwaukee is NOT the problem, Milwaukee HAS a problem, and we’re going to fix it.’Having Bob Donovan in the State Assembly would give a Michels Administration a powerful tool to help fix what’s broken in Milwaukee.Back in July, I wrote about the importance of voting for Bob Donovan in the August primary for the 84th Assembly District. Not only did he get through the primary, but he trounced his opponent. This is a testament to the fact that Bob Donovan is still a formidable political force.Bob Donovan is a rare breed in the Wisconsin political scene. He’s one of the very few who is not in it for power and popularity, but he is in it TO SERVE; pure and simple. With Bob Donovan, what you see is what you get, PROVEN leadership, Compassion, and integrity.Because of this, he has commanded the respect of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.

          "content": "The Republicans could see large gains in both chambers of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections, according to Epoch Times contributor and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.“I would say we’ll be between plus three and plus seven … in the Senate; and we’ll be between plus 20 and plus 50 in the House, with the most likely number being plus 44,” Gingrich told The Epoch Times.The GOP needs to flip five seats to win back House control. In the evenly divided Senate, Republicans need a net gain of one seat to claim the majority.With Election Day fast approaching, Democratic optimism appears to be fading as Republican candidates gain late momentum in key races across the country.In New Hampshire, Republican challenger Don Bolduc has narrowed the gap between himself and Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan to 2 points, according to an Oct. 20 poll by GOP pollster Fabrizio, Lee and Associates, well within the 4 percentage point margin of error. The poll, which was commissioned by Bolduc’s campaign, placed Hassan at 49 percent to Bolduc’s 47 percent.In Arizona, Trump-backed Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters is gaining ground in the stretch run. Polling data aggregator RealClearPolitics predicts the race to be a tossup and gives the Democrat incumbent, Mark Kelly, only a 2.5-point lead.In Pennsylvania, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman’s double-digit edge has evaporated in recent weeks. A recent AARP Pennsylvania poll conducted by Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research showed Fetterman with a 48 percent to 46 percent lead, which is within the margin of error of 4.4 points.In Georgia, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock’s lead over Republican nominee Herschel Walker is sliding, too. A recent Landmark Communication poll had the two tied at 46 percent, while an InsiderAdvantage survey showed Warnock 2 points ahead, within the margin of error of 4.2 percentage points.“Almost everywhere in the country, races are showing the Republicans tightening up,” Gingrich said. He says Democrats have only themselves to blame.Key Voter ConcernsCrime, inflation, border security, and “woke policies,” he said, are all “coming together” in a backlash against Democrats.“When you have sort of insane left-wing Democrats who believe that you don’t need prisons and that things can be dealt with by just being nice to murderers, I think the average person just thinks this is crazy,” he said, pointing to the crime concerns in New York as an example.For New York gubernatorial candidate Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), who has made crime a campaign focus, the issue hit close to home on Oct. 9 when two minors were wounded in a shooting outside his house, while Zeldin’s two 16-year-old daughters were inside. Zeldin, who was out campaigning at the time, said that one bullet landed 30 feet from the kitchen table where his daughters were doing homework.With near-daily press conferences to highlight the city’s crime crisis and his opponent’s failure to address it, Zeldin’s been closing on Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul in the contest, with the gap tightening to low single digits, positioning him for a potential upset victory in a deep-blue state.Hochul, facing political pressure, announced a plan on Oct. 22 with New York City Mayor Eric Adams to hire another 1,200 officers to address transit crime.Inflation, crime, and immigration are Republicans’ key campaign issues. In a handful of recent polls, voters appear to find them their biggest concerns at the moment.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Oct. 18 claimed that a New York Times/Siena poll showing that the economy and inflation ranked as voters’ top two concerns was an “outlier,” and that abortion is on top of voters’ minds.“I can tell you that women’s concerns about their freedom are very, very much still very significant in terms of how they will vote,” she told MSNBC. “It’s a matter of who turns out to vote,” she said, adding that she feels “pretty good” about her party’s chances.Abortion Issue Not Paying Off for Democrats[Click on my reply for rest of articl]https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-gop-could-gain-up-to-7-seats-in-senate-50-seats-in-house-gingrich_4814897.html?utm_source=ref_share&amp;utm_campaign=copy&amp;rs=SHRDKNKM",
