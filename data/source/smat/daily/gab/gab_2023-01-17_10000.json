          "content": "Flashes on the Sun Could Help Scientists Predict Solar FlaresIn the blazing upper atmosphere of the Sun, a team of scientists have found new clues that could help predict when and where the Sun’s next flare might explode.Using data from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, researchers from NorthWest Research Associates, or NWRA, identified small signals in the upper layers of the solar atmosphere, the corona, that can help identify which regions on the Sun are more likely to produce solar flares – energetic bursts of light and particles released from the Sun.They found that above the regions about to flare, the corona produced small-scale flashes – like small sparklers before the big fireworks.This information could eventually help improve predictions of flares and space weather storms – the disrupted conditions in space caused by the Sun’s activity. Space weather can affect Earth in many ways: producing auroras, endangering astronauts, disrupting radio communications, and even causing large electrical blackouts.Scientists have previously studied how activity in lower layers of the Sun’s atmosphere – such as the photosphere and chromosphere – can indicate impending flare activity in active regions, which are often marked by groups of sunspots, or strong magnetic regions on the surface of the Sun that are darker and cooler compared to their surroundings. The new findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal, add to that picture.“We can get some very different information in the corona than we get from the photosphere, or ‘surface’ of the Sun,” said KD Leka, lead author on the new study who is also a designated foreign professor at Nagoya University in Japan. “Our results may give us a new marker to distinguish which active regions are likely to flare soon and which will stay quiet over an upcoming period of time.”For their research, the scientists used a newly created image database of the Sun’s active regions captured by SDO. The publicly available resource, described in a companion paper also in The Astrophysical Journal, combines over eight years of images taken of active regions in ultraviolet and extreme-ultraviolet light. Led by Karin Dissauer and engineered by Eric L. Wagner, the NWRA team’s new database makes it easier for scientists to use data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO for large statistical studies.“It&#39;s the first time a database like this is readily available for the scientific community, and it will be very useful for studying many topics, not just flare-ready active regions,” Dissauer said.The NWRA team studied a large sample of active regions from the database, using statistical methods developed by team member Graham Barnes. The analysis revealed small flashes in the corona preceded each flare. These and other new insights will give researchers a better understanding of the physics taking place in these magnetically active regions, with the goal of developing new tools to predict solar flares.“With this research, we are really starting to dig deeper,” Dissauer said. “Down the road, combining all this information from the surface up through the corona should allow forecasters to make better predictions about when and where solar flares will happen.”",

The Lord is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.(SIDE NOTE - The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you. It’s more accurate and allowing Him to live in you is more feasible than merely trying to imitate behavior(s).According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them and according to 1 John 4:1, instructions are to test the spirits.There’s only one way to be saved, period (Mark 1:15, John 3:1-6).(SIDE NOTE - 100% of everyone’s born of water. Just think of every mom: Odds are that it got expressed at one time or another - “We need to get to the hospital. My water just broke.”)Jesus at Calvary is the only way anyone is ever forgiven, again, period (John 14:6, John 19:30 and Galatians 2:19-21).(ANOTHER SIDE NOTE - The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Because of Jesus and His substitute sacrifice at Calvary (Matthew 20:28, Mark 10:45), your forgiveness is justified and the wrath of The Lord is turned away from you. Logically, it’s followed by His resurrection which means you live because He lives (Matthew 28:6, John 14:19b, Hebrews 7:24-25).  (Lest anyone forget that we are FORGIVEN through Calvary (John 19:30) but it’s His life which saves (Romans 5:10).)Forgiveness is once for all (Hebrews 10:14), and it means it’s past, present and future (John 5:24, John 10:28, 2 Corinthians 5:19, Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 2:13-14, 1 John 2:12, 2 Peter 1:5-9, Jude 1:24-25, etc. Only one is needed since there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.). There’s no need to “keep a tally” or “visit some confession booth”. That’s all above and beyond of how loved and accepted you really are and why you are told to love and forgive others in return (Romans 5:8).People come to Jesus to be forgiven and have resurrection life, not in order to have a fat wallet, great health, cool car, nice job, big house, etc.JOHN 1:29 (RSV)The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!(”)JOHN 6:29 (RSV)Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”ROMANS 5:10 (RSV)For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.https://www.biblegateway.com/",
