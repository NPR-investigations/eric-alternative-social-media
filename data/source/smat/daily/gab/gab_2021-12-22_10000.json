The archbishops of the ADL the CRIF, the Keren Hayesod are trembling in the tundra of Birobidzhan and pouring sweat in the jungles of Manaus. The gabbais who tell America where to point its guns, the gvirs who decide the contents of our laws, the hakhams who brainwash generations of children into compliant shabbat goys, are crumpled up whimpering in the growing shadow of an approaching giant. Oy Gevalt! Will the world stop turning, will the sun rise in the West, will the Earth and Sky exchange places? Regular Jews are tempted by Zemmour like Christ",

          "content": "Pure government over reach shut down by a judge.<br /><br /><br />A judge dismissed a charge Tuesday against a Georgia state lawmaker, saying his failure to call 911 when a friend called him about a fatal wreck is not a crime.<br /><br />Polk County Superior Court Senior Judge Stephen Schuster ruled Rep. Trey Kelley could not be charged with reckless conduct because prosecutors did not claim the Cedartown Republican had committed an underlying crime.<br /><br />“No reading of either the hit and run statute or the reckless conduct statute leaves a reasonable person with the impression that a disinterested third party, not present for an automobile accident, who later learns of the purported accident is under a legal duty pursuant to the reckless conduct statute to immediately contact 911,” Schuster wrote.<br /><br />Ralph “Ryan” Dover III hit Eric Keais on Sept. 13, 2019, in Cedartown with his SUV. Instead of calling 911, he called his friend, Kelley, officials have said. Kelley in turn called Cedartown Police Chief Jamie Newsome at home, according to authorities.<br /><br />An officer was sent to the area, unaware someone may have been injured, and eventually found Keais lying in a ditch, gravely wounded. Keais died from his injuries soon afterward.<br /><br />Kelley, who represents all of Polk and parts of Floyd and Haralson counties, was indicted last year on a charge of reckless conduct, alleging he wrongly did not report the crash. Dover was indicted on charges of felony hit-and-run and reckless conduct.<br /><br />Schuster said prosecutors were impermissibly stretching the law to create a “judicially crafted crime” by combining some elements of the hit-and-run law, even though Kelley was not charged with that offense, with the reckless conduct law.<br /><br />“The hit and run statute does not apply to Kelley because he was not the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident, in the vehicle, or at the scene at the time of the accident,” Schuster wrote. “The law imposes no duty upon Kelley to contact law enforcement.”<br /><br />The charges against Dover still stand. There’s also a federal lawsuit filed by Eric Keais’ father, Manfred Keais, seeking money damages from Dover, Kelley, Newsome, and the city of Cedartown. The defendants deny wrongdoing and are currently trying to get the case dismissed.<br /><br />Kelley’s lawyer, Lester Tate, said in a statement that the ruling is “long-awaited vindication of the fact that Trey Kelley did nothing wrong.”<br /><br />“We would first, again, offer our condolences and prayers to the family and friends of Eric Keais who tragically lost his life in September of 2019,” Tate said. “But we have always said and always believed that Rep. Kelley broke no law that night. He was not in the car when Mr. Keais was involved in the accident and did not know what had been hit when he arrived at the scene.”<br /><br />Kelley this year stepped down from his post as House majority whip after he was indicted and his wife filed for divorce.",

Schmitt and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, both Republicans, on Oct. 29 co-led the 10 states in suing the Biden administration over the mandate, calling it “unconstitutional, unlawful, and unwise.”<br /><br />“It will not harm the federal government to maintain the status quo while the courts decide the issues of the President’s authority and the implications for federalism. The Court concludes that, on balance, consideration of the harms and the public interest weigh in favor of a preliminary injunction,” reads the Monday preliminary injunction order from U.S. Magistrate Judge David Noce",

Vaxxed or unvaxxed, the probability of death is statistically insignificant. So why be vaxxed? <br /><br />In many commercial and public venues I have to show \"my papers\" to be served and soon state and federal benefits that were \"earned\" while working, like retirement, social security etc will be tied to the vaxx status - it is on the table.<br /><br />I lost a teaching position because I refuse to be forced to pollute my body with a substance with no longitudinal studies to forecast long term effects.  <br /><br />The contrived COVID smokescreen and the media induced mass intellectual coma of the American public has led to a totalitarian state in which all the institutions of government, media, military and academia have hijacked a Republic and turned it into a CCP modeled oligarchic, fascist state. <br /><br />So, as many of us try to celebrate the birth of Christ, even though Fauci says to shun the unvaxxed at family gatherings, I can only pray for another Savior to eliminate this democratic/progressive evil that means to enslave us and enrich themselves.",

However considering that TRS requires you to basically use their paywall to get most of their content and that's $120 a year. At minimum lets say they have 1,000 people paying (lets be real here its far more than that) then that's $120,000 just off of that per year alone. This isn't even accounting for things like donations or party dues for members of the NJP and more. <br /><br />So its easy to state that they're getting $120,000 at absolute bare minimum. Which no one should have an issue if someone is making money. Anyone who solely complains on that is just arguing in bad faith and they just don't like said individual. The more money within our movement the better. The question is, how are they spending this? From what we can gather, we can't say for certain. We don't know anyone involved with TRS and we won't rumor spread. <br /><br />However to ourselves it is suspect that they're making this much money and the only real things that they're doing with it besides paying for TRS and National Justice is using the money to fund further fundraising events like the NJP meetings where you come in and listen to Mike Enoch do his speeches and give more money. Hopefully we're wrong here but on speculation alone it seems pretty suspect that they're pulling in all this cash and not really doing much with it. <br /><br />Like with their news site, National Justice being basically just Eric Striker posting articles once in a while. Which is weird. Even the National Alliance, despite being a skeleton of what the organization once was and no one really gives a fuck about them anymore since Dr. Pierce died. With the few left, they're still up to date in posting articles <a href=\"https://nationalvanguard.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>nationalvanguard.org/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>. Most of TRS's focus it seems, seems to be in making content you have to use the paywall for.<br /><br />Though this is a personal thing. With The American Futurist, we've always published the results of our fundraisers as well as what we're doing with money we do manage to get donated to us. Such as paying for site costs or other projects. Unless TRS publishes what they're doing with the money they're using. It's all speculation.",

          "content": "Commie California Gov. Newsom Mandates Booster Shots for Health Care Workers<br /><br />California will require health care workers to receive COVID-19 booster shots in order to retain their fully vaccinated status, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Tuesday.<br /><br />“California will require healthcare workers to get their booster,” Newsom said on Twitter. “With Omicron on the rise, we’re taking immediate actions to protect Californians and ensure our hospitals are prepared.”<br /><br />“Omicron is spreading rapidly and we must do all we can to keep staff at hospitals and medical facilities healthy and safe to protect Californians during a potential winter surge,” his office further said.<br /><br />The Democratic governor said more details of the requirement would be released on Wednesday. Newsom has scheduled a news conference in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br /><br />The Epoch Times has contacted Newsom’s office for comment.<br /><br />The state is poised for a surge in new infections amid holiday parties and family gatherings forced indoors by a series of winter storms.<br /><br />Last week, Newsom, who imposed the first statewide shutdown order in March 2020, warned that cases would likely rise and re-imposed a rule requiring everyone to wear masks at public indoor gatherings. Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest city, once again canceled its in-person New Year’s Eve celebration.<br /><br />The governor’s announcement came shortly after federal officials said the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is now the dominant source of new infections in the United States, accounting for roughly 73 percent of new infections nationwide, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br /><br />Health officials cited CDC figures for the week ending Dec. 18 that showed a nearly six-fold increase in Omicron’s share of infections in only one week.<br /><br />The variant was first detected by doctors in Africa first less than a month ago, and on Nov. 26, the World Health Organization designated it as a “variant of concern.” The variant has since been reported in around 90 countries.<br /><br />Few Omicron-related deaths have been officially confirmed so far worldwide. Officials on Monday said an unvaccinated man in Texas died after contracting the Omicron variant of COVID-19. It’s not clear if any other Omicron-related deaths have been reported in the United States.<br /><br />South African ministry of health officials last week said that their rates of hospitalization due to Omicron are about one-tenth of the hospitalization rate for the Delta wave earlier this year.<br /><br />Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said on Tuesday that he didn’t anticipate another lockdown because “I think we’re so much better protected than we were.”<br /><br />However, he said he believes restrictions such as masking indoors will continue into February and perhaps even March, depending on vaccination, hospitalization, and infection rates.<br /><br />New Mexico has also mandated booster shots for health care workers.",

Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing depends on your point of view, but it seems silly to expect a traditionalist Catholic politics to emerge when the most vital right-of-center forces in the Catholic Church are deeply at odds with the Roman pontiff.<br />Douthat continues:<br /><em>And here I think the analogy to the new progressivism especially fails. What gets called “wokeness” is particularly powerful among elites, yes, but the shift in attitudes on, say, racism is broader than that; if similar numbers of previously secular Americans were suddenly endorsing Christian doctrine we would rightly call it a revival. Well before it began to impose itself on the doubtful and reluctant, the new progressivism ascended — first within the church-like structures of academia, and then in liberal culture more broadly — precisely because it had conviction on its side, as against the more careerist and soulless aspects of liberal meritocracy.<\/em><\/p><p><em>Social justice activists did not triumph, in other words, by first getting an opportunistically woke politician elected president and having her impose their doctrines by fiat. Their cultural advance has had political assistance, but it began with that most ancient power — the power of belief.<\/em><br />Read the rest of Dreher here -- <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/can-politics-save-christianity-douthat/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theamericanconservative.com/dreher/can-politi<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">cs-save-christianity-douthat/<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br />Read the rest of Douthat here -- <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/18/opinion/christianity-politics.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>nytimes.com/2021/12/18/opinion/christianity-p<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">olitics.html<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><\/p>"

The well-meaning author uses the label “traditional Catholics” to refer to Catholics who are simply pro-life. The consequence of this sort of rhetoric, even when well-intended, paints pro-abortion Catholic politicians, such as Biden and Pelosi, as ordinary, devout, or even “deeply Catholic” Catholics, as if belief in the sanctity of life were somehow optional. Meanwhile, those pro-life Catholics, they are just traditionalists (read: extremists). <br /><br />What is the result of this rhetoric? Division. “And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand” (Mark 3:25). All Catholics—regardless of what Mass they attend—ought to defend the Church’s traditions and teachings, lest they also find themselves in the ghetto just in time to feel the flames. <br /><br />We ought to refuse to label the unchanging core beliefs of the Church as if they were somehow not the eternal roots for all of us. We ought to refuse to label the practices of the vast majority of ordinary Catholics, Saints, and martyrs for well over a thousand years as something somehow fringe or unordinary within the Church herself. It obscures the fact that the Church’s teachings and the Roman Rite belong to Roman Catholics simply.<br /><br />The Vatican cries for unity within the Roman Rite. If it is unity that we want, it is time to dig down even deeper to our Roman roots. For it is Romanitas, the Roman spirit—not traditional this or progressive that—that unites us Roman Catholics in Christ.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.crisismagazine.com/2021/is-it-time-to-stop-using-the-label-traditional-catholic?mc_cid=b83e733c27&amp;mc_eid=88c2534e67\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>crisismagazine.com/2021/is-it-time-to-stop-us<span class=\"invisible\">ing-the-label-traditional-catholic?mc_cid=b83e733c27&amp;mc_eid=88c2534e67<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Power Behind Big News &amp; the founding fathers of propaganda  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmKiiY_HqsY\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>youtube.com/watch?v=fmKiiY_HqsY<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>    <br /><br />The CFR and the Media <a href=\"https://cfrmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>cfrmedia.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>  <br /><br />Here is a great series on Bernays <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040218/http:/smellslikehumanspirit.com/edward-bernays-propaganda\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>web.archive.org/web/20160304040218/http:/smel<span class=\"invisible\">lslikehumanspirit.com/edward-bernays-propaganda<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
