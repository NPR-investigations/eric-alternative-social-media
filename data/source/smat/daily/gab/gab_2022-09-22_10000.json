The suspect is out of jail after paying a $900 fee to the bondsman, according to Houston Crime Stoppers.180th Criminal District Court Judge DaSean Jones lowered the bond for accused murderer Eric Todd Semien from $50,000 to $9,000, Fox 26 Houston’s Randy Wallace reported. Seiman’s bond had been reduced two other times and in both cases, the bonds were revoked for breaking bond conditions.Semien is accused of murdering Javier Moreno and Rober Pantoja in May 2016. Three others are charged in connection with the murders.“They killed two people, and they also put a gun to a young mother with a 2-month-old, they put a gun to her head as well,” Houston Crime Stoppers Andy Kahn told Fox 26.In 2017, Semien walked out of jail after posting a $150,000 bond but ended up back in jail four months later after violating the conditions of his bond, Wallace reported.“They (the court) reinstate the bond, but they lower the bond to $50,000,” Kahan explained. “Normally when you get your bond revoked, they raise the amount. But this one went dramatically down.”Semien ended back up in jail again after being convicted for evading arrest. That court sentenced him to 60 days in county jail.Judge Jones then lowered his bond yet again. This time to $9,000.“I have never in my life seen a bond that low for capital murder,” Kahn stated. “I’ve never seen a bond that low for murder.”Houston businessman, attorney, and columnist Bill King said he has never seen anything like this.“Capital murder is one of the clear exceptions in Texas law that you can completely deny bond,” King stated. “A $9,000 bond, you pay the bondsman $900. So for $900 he was able to get out and is roaming around the city of Houston right now.”Judge DaSean Jones, a Democrat, took the bench of the 180th Criminal District Court in January 2019. He is currently on the November general election ballot in Harris County. Jones faces Republican challenger Tami Pierce. Jones was not opposed in the 2022 Democrat Primary election in March.Fox 26 sent a news crew to Semien’s apartment in northwest Harris County to try and get a comment.“Judging by the eviction notice on the door and all the stuff outside, Eric Semien is long gone,” Wallace reported.Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior news contributor for the Breitbart Texas-Border team.

But somewhere along the line, the office went completely off the rails. Eliot Spitzer was elected AG in 1998, and spent his two terms in frightening misuse of the office to further his naked political ambitions, mainly through shaking down financial institutions on the thinnest of pretexts. After eight years improperly using this tactic to keep his name in the headlines, he was then elected Governor; whereupon his successor — Andrew Cuomo — followed the same playbook for one term, and with the same result of becoming Governor. The next guy, Eric Schneiderman, was, if this is even possible, the worst of the three in the category of politicized prosecutions and shakedowns. Mercifully, Schneiderman was forced from office in a sex scandal before he could move up to the governorship.In the 2018 election, we got a woman named Letitia James. By this time, all pretense that the Attorney General ought to be an impartial law enforcement officer had been long forgotten. James not only made no secret, but actually bragged and campaigned on her intention to misuse the powers of the office to go after political enemies, most particularly Donald Trump, who was President at the time. And, she promised, she would not just sue Trump in his capacity as President for allegedly exceeding his constitutional powers, but she would go after him personally in any way she could, to try to destroy him. The following quote is a summary from the Buffalo News on October 30, 2018, in the run-up to that election:Democrat Letitia James promises much more than simply opposing President Trump should she win her Nov. 6 election for New York attorney general against Republican Keith Wofford. Indeed, she will continue current Attorney General Barbara Underwood’s litigation against Trump policies on immigration, civil rights, the environment and minorities. But she promises even more scrutiny of the president’s personal and corporate finances, his real estate holdings, whether he has dodged taxes, and more.That was just under four years ago. In the intervening years, there have been public indications from time to time that some kind of big investigation was going on (for example, court filings involving Trump’s accounting firm Mazars), but never any charges. Meanwhile, there was a companion criminal investigation of Trump going on in the Manhattan DA’s office. (In New York, the AG has only certain limited criminal jurisdiction, and most criminal jurisdiction rests in the county DAs.). The Manhattan DA conducting that investigation, Cyrus Vance, Jr., retired at the end of 2021, and a new guy, Alvin Bragg, took over at the start of this year. Bragg promptly held a review of his office’s Trump criminal investigation, and decided to walk away from it. I covered that subject in a March 11 post here.But Letitia James is running for re-election in November, less than two months away. She needs to get her name in the news. Does she have anything at all to show for her four years of effort pursuing Trump?This morning James held a big press conference to announce the filing of a 214 page Complaint against Trump.

It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile. This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”LUKE 9:26 (NLT)If anyone is ashamed of me and my message, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels.https://www.biblegateway.com/Why is it that many twist these passages to somehow imply, “Now get out there and witness to earn some brownie points.

          "contentraw": "Self-explanatory, and begs a $10,000 question –<br /><br />ROMANS 1:16-17 (NLT)<br />For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile. This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”<br />LUKE 9:26 (NLT)<br />If anyone is ashamed of me and my message, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels.<br /><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>biblegateway.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Why is it that many twist these passages to somehow imply, “Now get out there and witness to earn some brownie points. After all, you need to be a good Christian.”?<br /><br />A cult is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection.
