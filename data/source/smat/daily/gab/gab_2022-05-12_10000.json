That directly contradicts his statement to Congress.On May 3, 2011, Holder told a Judiciary Committee hearing, \"I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks.\"Yet internal Justice Department documents show that at least ten months before that hearing, Holder began receiving frequent memos discussing Fast and Furious. The documents came from the head of the National Drug Intelligence Center and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer.In Fast and Furious, ATF agents allegedly allowed thousands of weapons to cross the border and fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels.Gunwalking scandal uncovered at ATFIt's called letting guns \"walk,\" and it remained secret to the public until Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was murdered last December.

In fiscal year 2014, for instance, $36 million was paid out and that is on average $21,100 per scientist,” Andrzejewski said.\n\n“We also find that during this period, leadership at NIH was involved in receiving third-party payments. For instance, Francis Collins, the immediate past director of NIH, received 14 payments. Dr. Anthony Fauci received 23 payments and his deputy, Clifford Lane, received eight payments.”",

While a new breed of politicians--Constitutional Populists, I call them--are winning important victories, Pharma Mitch McConnell and Liz Cheney’s dear friend, Kevin McCarthy, are busily stabbing them in the back. <br /><br />THE SCRIPTURE &amp; SCRIPTURAL RESOURCES: <br /><br />Jeremiah 6:14-15 <br /><br />14 They dress the wound of my people<br /><br />    as though it were not serious.<br /><br />‘Peace, peace,’ they say,<br /><br />    when there is no peace.<br /><br />15 Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct?<br /><br />    No, they have no shame at all;<br /><br />    they do not even know how to blush.<br /><br />So they will fall among the fallen;<br /><br />    they will be brought down when I punish them,”<br /><br />says the Lord.<br /><br />THE NEWS &amp; COMMENT:<br /><br />J.D. Vance And The New Right Are Racking Up Wins, While The Establishment Stabs At Their Backs<br /><br />Attitudes on abortions have changed as people have grown to understand the reality of the procedure. <br /><br />CNN Poll: \"As a Registered Voter Enthusiastic about the Midterm vote, will you be Happy or Angry if Roe v Wade is overturned\"?<br /><br />HAPPY: 38% (+18)<br /><br />ANGRY: 20% <br /><br />But, do we see Mitch and Kevin getting in front of this battle? No. As always, the leftist portion of The Party is taking it head on. The most corrupt AG in history, Eric Holder is on it:<br /><br />[AUDIO] - CBS Chats With Holder About Plan to SHRED Constitution to Help Dems<br /><br />Do we see Mitch and Kevin demanding their dear friend, Chuck Schumer disavow the mobs outside the homes of Supreme Court Justices?",

In response to the eminently reasonable law, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former cop who should know better, has spent taxpayer dollars on billboards in Florida to lure gay Floridians to move to New York.

'If I had to do it all over again, she would be prosecuted in adult court.'However, his critics say his apparent remorse is just a public stunt as recall efforts against him grow.'He knew Fox was going to run with those tapes. It was damage-control time,' Eric Siddall, a deputy district attorney and outspoken critic of the DA, told the Times.Amid growing frustration with the progressive prosecutor, more than 600 deputy district attorneys throughout LA county endorsed his recall Tuesday during an Association of Deputy District Attorneys meeting.Gascón was sworn in as LA County's 43rd district attorney in December 2020, and critics have blamed him for a spike in violent crime in the region.Los Angeles has seen a 54 percent increase in murders since 2019, a rise in the number of street shootings since 2020, and an increase in the number of armed holdups.",
