            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Determined to stop his high-octane lethal feud is Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen.\r\nPredictably, the inquisition starts in the city’s police headquarters. There, the veteran cop finds nailing a jelly to the wall far easier than stopping a merc’ on a mission.\r\nIn the predator’s cross-hairs are the most sinister but successful sinners of Liverpool’s underworld. ‘Mess with the best, die like the rest’ appears to be Jack Scarlett’s maxim as after being crossed in love and trust he evens the score.\r\nThe killer question is, can Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen stop Jack Scarlett, and does he really want to. That is for you to decide.",

We will remove a post according to our interpretation (written by us) of the guidelines below. If there is any confusion, please DM.\n***My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” Ephesians 3:20 TPT\n\n***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING: Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\n\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\n\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\n\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \n\n***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else's well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? \n\nWith that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\n1. Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\n\n2. Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.\n\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\n\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\n\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\n\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \n\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\n\n***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\n\n***“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.” Numbers 6:24-27 ESV\n\n***Group Creator:  @Micaiah\nAdmins/Mods: @Shooglenifty, @riustan",

If there is any confusion, please DM.<br />*<\/em>*My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: &quot;Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” Ephesians 3:20 TPT<\/p><p>***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING: Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):<\/p><ol><li><p>Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don&#39;t respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don&#39;t post it. <\/p><\/li><\/ol><p>***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God&#39;s heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else&#39;s well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? <\/p><p>With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:<\/p><ol><li><p>Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)<\/p><\/li><li><p>Posts that don&#39;t meet the criteria mentioned above<\/p><\/li><li><p>Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. <\/p><\/li><li><p>All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.<\/p><\/li><\/ol><p>***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.<\/p><p>***“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.” Numbers 6:24-27 ESV<\/p><p>***Group Creator:  <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/Micaiah\" class=\"mention\">@Micaiah<\/a><br />Admins/Mods: <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/Shooglenifty\" class=\"mention\">@Shooglenifty<\/a>, <a data-focusable=\"true\" role=\"link\" href=\"https://gab.com/riustan\" class=\"mention\">@riustan<\/a><\/p>",

In part 1, he explains that prior to JWST, the Big Bang theory’s predictions were contradicted by 16 different sets of observations and confirmed by only one—the abundance of deuterium. Papers summarizing why the Big Bang hypothesis is invalid have been censored by major journals and even by the open pre-print website arXiv.

Meanwhile, imports totaled 336,307 TEUs – down 28 percent year-over-year.The biggest drag was from incoming cargo that has shifted to the East and Gulf coasts due to protracted labor negotiations between West Coast port workers and their employers, Port of L.A. Executive Director Gene Seroka said during a news conference on Tuesday, Nov. 15.This marks the lowest October import tally since the global financial crisis in 2009 and the lowest monthly imports since May 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns. This year’s October imports were down 14 percent from October 2019.According to Seroka, the steep decline is mainly due to three factors: a lack of a West Coast port labor contract, an early peak season and lower consumer spending on durables compared to purchases during the pandemic.The port executive, as well as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, repeatedly highlighted the labor issue during the news conference.Seroka said he has been “knocking on doors,” speaking to shippers and carriers in the U.S., Asia and Europe and “looking to get that allocation back to Los Angeles.” But he admitted that “it starts with getting a labor agreement.”Garcetti, meanwhile, insisted that there will not be a strike. “I don’t say this as someone trying to market [Los Angeles], but the remaining issues are so much more minor than in past years when we’ve been able to resolve this,” the mayor said.Recent reports said the Port of New York/New Jersey has unseated L.A. as America’s busiest port. But Seroka isn’t worried. (Related: Freight companies expect “muted peak season” due to waning retailer demand.)“We have been in the No. 1 position for 22 consecutive years and one or two months [in second place] is not going to create a trend. Our dwell times have improved and the shipping backlog is nearly gone. We’re eager to ramp volume back up,” he said.October imports at Port of Long Beach also declineThe Port of Long Beach also reported a 24 percent year-on-year drop in October imports to 293,924 TEUs, which makes for the port’s lowest import number in any month since April 2020 and its lowest import total for the month of October since 2012. The decline was 13 percent from October 2019.Port officials blamed the reduced consumer demand, which has caused retailers to cut back on their imports. “After having brought in large quantities of merchandise earlier in the year, retail inventories are high contributing to the slowdown,” one official said.Port of Long Beach executives also acknowledged that there has been a shift of imported goods toward the Gulf and East coast ports, which many industry analysts attribute to the prior backlogs in Southern California as well as the fears of potential labor actions as the contract negotiations for Pacific Coast dockworkers have dragged on since their contract expired on July 1.But Port of Long Beach Executive Director Mario Cordero believes that the supply chain will be back to normal and cargo will continue to move.“I am optimistic that store shelves will be stocked and goods will be available for delivery during the holiday season. Over the long term, the San Pedro Bay ports complex will continue to be a competitive, strategic and sustainable gateway for trans-Pacific trade,” Cordero stated.http://Collapse.news has more on the collapsing transportation and freight industries in the United States.This video talks about ocean freight rates in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.This video is from the What is happening channel on http://Brighteon.com.More related stories:Shipping rates drop 75% amid plummeting US retail demand.Shipping cost from Asia to US West Coast drops 84% year-over-year as consumer demand plunges.Companies now looking at INVENTORY SURPLUS in certain products as demand dwindles.Port of Los Angeles director: US supply chain at risk if rail service does not improve.https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-11-17-la-port-october-imports-drop-28percent-yoy.html",

One day after securing leadership in the US House, Republicans held a major press conference to detail the complexity of the Biden crime family’s impact around the world.GOP leaders claim that Democrat President Joe Biden was involved in his son Hunter’s controversial foreign business deals, which allegedly span 50 different countries, proving a massive conflict of interest, so this is about to get very interesting for Democrats.Joe Biden has long denied involvement in and knowledge of his son’s foreign dealings, which have been under investigation for years.Rep. James Comer accused President Biden, in a brutal smackdown, of being ‘chairman of the board’ of his family’s business dealings and even claimed the White House spent taxpayer funds of more than $250,000 to deflect negative stories about Hunter and his bizarre behavior and corruption.‘This is an investigation of Joe Biden,’ he said. ‘I think we’ve laid out the evidence as to why we feel it’s important, and we’re going to move forward with that.’Comer said later, ‘We’re trying to stay focused on – was Joe Biden directly involved with Hunter Biden’s business deals, and is he compromised?’ adding that he’d even like members of the Biden family to testify before the House when asked, but said the main focus of their probe right now was to access bank records.That is going to freak the Democrats out for sure- but Republicans now have control.‘As part of our investigation, we have evidence that the finances, credit cards, and bank accounts of Hunter and Joe Biden were commingled, if not shared,’ Comer said.‘One of Hunter’s closest associates, Eric Schwerin, was accessing Joe Biden’s money and writing checks to reimburse Hunter.’The Daily Mail reported on the newest developments:Hunter Biden’s business dealings are the subject of the House GOP’s first announced investigation of the party’s new majority in Congress’ lower chamber.“At least one of those red flags, known as ‘SARs,’ allegedly ‘connects Hunter Biden and his business associates to international human trafficking, among other illegal activities,’ Comer said.‘We have repeatedly called on the Biden Treasury Department to release additional financial documents to committee Republicans, but thus far Treasury has refused,’ the lawmaker said. ‘We want to know what the Biden administration has tried to hide from the American people and why they are not being transparent.’Hunter ally Schwerin was reportedly head of the president’s son’s company and handed the majority of his finances – and appointed to a position within the Obama administration, when Joe Biden was vice president.‘After an apparent falling out with Schwerin, Hunter began coordinating business himself – and increasingly the deals brought in Joe Biden as a direct equity holder,’ Comer said.He claimed Hunter went a step further and tried to get these bank alerts quashed – allegedly with the help of a Clinton administration official.Comer also took a swipe at more holistic coverage of the president’s son that puts Hunter’s questionable ethics into context with his battle against drug addiction.‘Hunter Biden isn’t this guy who just got a bad rap because he’s got a drug problem,’ Comer said.The lawmakers said a report detailing their investigation and evidence thus far – which appears to largely be made up of whistleblower testimony – would be forthcoming.The troubling scope of Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine and China came to light when the New York Post, and subsequently http://DailyMail.com, authenticated the contents of a laptop hard drive purportedly belonging to the president’s only surviving son.He received a lucrative salary while on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, despite having no experience in the industry, while his father was vice president and leading a coalition to crack down on corruption there.Emails recovered from the laptop also show Hunter discussing with associates the beginnings of a business deal in China – where one message discussing equity stakes carves out 10 percent ‘for the big guy.’Republicans on Thursday alleged that ‘the big guy’ is the US president.‘At a time when Americans are suffering from high energy prices, because of this administration’s terrible energy policy, we find evidence that Hunter Biden and Joe Biden were involved in a scheme to try to get China to buy liquefied natural gas, and from a whistleblower, to try to get their foot in the door with China starting to purchase an interest in natural gas drillers,’ Comer said.Read morehttps://republicbrief.com/joe-biden-was-the-chairman-of-the-board-involved-in-hunters-foreign-deals-white-house-spent-250k-to-deflect-stories-on-son/",
