I wanted to select someone outside USA so maybe the French Eric Zemmour who was a famous TV presenter and lately candidate for the French presidency. Jayda Fransen is the head of the far-right party British Freedom Party in Britain.What amazes me in these people is their ability to behave by deceit in the same way without having really a central comandment. This reminds me of the movie that I always refer to of John Carpenter \"They Live\" who shows the Jews as an Alien race wearing a kind of magical watches with wich they can communicate to organize against Humans or the Goyim.There are many other famous and influential people on the social media and Alternative media, even on the mainstream media. It is impossible that they don't know about the Jewish role in everything, but they intentionally hide it. I can in most cases support the work of these people on the average sleeping Goy who is starting to wake up or just feeling the smell of conspiracies in mainstream narrative. We need such right-wingers who don't talk about Jews to make the beginners cross the gate. They will sooner or later discover the full truth.Probably the most important is not to forget the Jewishness of these people especially when they steer us against other secondary or fake enemies. Take the example of many anti-Muslim right-Wingers in Europe like Eric Zemmour who never mentions that his people are those who bring the Muslims to France. Such people might have a role later to misguide and also to use the Nationalist feeling of ethno-Europeans in order to use them in clashes or political pressure in the democratic game.We are probably very trapped in a mental Gulag and the attacks of Jewry is intensifying day after day. They are closing Channels not only on Youtube, but also on Bitchute and Odysee  while distracting us with racial clashes with the millions of people they have been bringing since the last 3-4 decades.What about your country, your city? Who is trending now as a \"right wing\" Jewish activist / politician?Btw Stefan Molineux of Canada is a great example, and sure the famous Alex Jones who believes in all conspiracies and tells us \"the Nazis are coming\". I think he is right, we are coming, not an army but as common people in homes and companies from everywhere, even the grandma and grandpa. Those evil \"Nazis\".",

Rittenhouse was acquitted of the murder last year. He was also cleared for shooting dead one other person and wounding another. Huber's girlfriend, Hannah Gittings, requested the memorial be put up earlier this month, public documents filed by the commission show, on a tree in Anderson Park.The proposal garnered national attention earlier this week, after Kevin Mathewson, a former Kenosha alderman who now works as an investigative journalist, received a tip early Monday morning about the then-unreported request.Mathewson, who served on the commission with three of the five current aldermen - including chair Eric Haugaard - then sent out an email blast about the proposal's existence, and wrote about it on his website, Kenosha County Eye.The proposal soon became the subject of scrutiny by both the press and outraged citizens of Kenosha - who showed up in droves to the commission meeting to voice their opposition to the planned tribute.Mathewson, who also attended the meeting and recorded the proceedings to post to YouTube, told http://DailyMail.com Thursday that he believes the council members planned to quietly the proposal Monday, and would have if its existence had remained under the radar.'There's not a doubt in my mind it would have passed,' Matthewson told http://DailyMail.com in an interview, noting the meetings usually don't garner such attendance. 'They didn't expect a bunch of people to be there.'Mathewson's footage of the meeting, which was streamed live and has since garnered more than 35,000 views, shows a slew of citizens voicing their concerns regarding the memorial, spurring the city officials to vote 3-2 to table the proposal.",

Miquiel Guerrero, 23, was arrested on March 30 after he and five others surrounded the unidentified victim, 53, and his car after they crashed into each other on Exterior Street in the Grand Concourse neighborhood.A man cops say is Guerrero was then filmed brutally-attacking his victim while wearing knuckle-dusters while his posse jumped on the man's car and stole it. The van driver made no attempt to fight back.  Shockingly, Guerrero has since been freed back onto the streets, despite the horrific nature of the violence meted out on his alleged victim. He's due back in court May 23 on a misdemeanor charge, amid ongoing fury over New York's soft-on-crime laws that critics blame for a recent spike in violent crime. Surveillance footage shows the group circling the victim, with one jumping on top of the car, as Guerrero swings the driver's door open and begins to violently punch the victim. Police records indicate Guerrero wrapped a metal object around his knuckles when he pummeled the man, who suffered a shattered left eye and bruising in the face, nose and back. Officials did not specify what the object Guerroro used was. It is also unclear if he has any prior convictions.  After being beaten, the 53-year-old can be seen running away from the scene and two men enter his Kia and begin to drive off with it. While three others hop in an unoccupied Honda that was caught in the crash, according to the New York Post.  Guerrero, who stayed on the scene for unknown reasons, was later arrested and charged with assault, menacing, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment. Police are now looking for the other group members, all aged between 18 and 25, according to authorities. The victim was transported to Jacobi Medical Center and was treated for a fractured eye socket and facial cuts. 'It's clear what we are confronting: A perception among criminals that there are no consequences, even for serious crime. We need tangible changes,' added Sewell. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has now vowed to crack down on transit crimes, which is up more than 60 percent, but also lazy officers patrolling subway stations. Adams made the plea at a press conference Tuesday when asked by a journalist about reports of multiple uniformed cops being spotted scrolling through phones while on duty guarding the city's crime-ridden transport network.",
