The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

It is without a doubt that he needs a second term as Governor of Florida and strong consideration for President. I hope everyone enjoys!

Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

The sources allege that employees at Facebook have been red-flagging any suspicious private messages over the last 19 months, sending the information directly to the FBI’s domestic terrorism operational unit in Washington, D.C. These actions have been carried out without the use of an official subpoena.“It was done outside the legal process and without probable cause,” said one of the anonymous sources. “Facebook provides the FBI with private conversations which are protected by the First Amendment without any subpoena.”Subsequently, the contents of these messages would be sent out to various FBI field offices across the country as potential “leads,” leading to official subpoena requests from the relevant U.S. Attorney’s offices so that the FBI could officially obtain the conversations for their records.The sources further detailed that the targets of such surveillance operations were overwhelmingly “conservative, right-wing individuals.”“They were gun-toting, red-blooded Americans [who were] angry after the election and shooting off their mouths and talking about staging protests. There was nothing criminal, nothing about violence or massacring or assassinating anyone,” the source continued. “As soon as a subpoena was requested, within an hour, Facebook sent back gigabytes of data and photos. It was ready to go. They were just waiting for that legal process so they could send it.”Even though many of the subsequent subpoenas failed to yield any signs of violence or terrorism, Facebook would nevertheless cooperate with the FBI and continue handing over even more information.Report Ad Report Ad “As soon as a subpoena was requested, within an hour, Facebook sent back gigabytes of data and photos.

Still, 50% of employers anticipate job cuts in the next six months.<br />Feds have raised the interest rates 4 times this year. For the first time since 2008, mortgage interest rates are over 6%.

No welcome wagon? <br />Eric Adams has opened 14 luxury hotels in NYC free to the illegals. Nearly 5 MILLION illegals have skipped across Joe's border already.

            "description": "Donoso Cortés on Gab: '@bomber_harris Au contraire, refuser la liberté d'expression de quelqu'un au motif qu'il y est opposé est une attitude aux antipodes de la liberté d'expression. La démocratie de suffrage universel suppose que le peuple est capable de faire ses choix et ses tris, se forger lui-même des convictions et désamorcer les propagandes radicales. S'il est dit que censurer les antidémocrates est une absolue nécessité pour sauver la démocratie, le propos sous-jacent est sans équivoque : ce même peuple est incapable de prendre des décisions rationnelles sans l'action de l'État, ce qui revient à discréditer le fondement même de la démocratie à suffrage universel. Dans un deuxième temps, cela reviendrait à contrarier la souveraineté populaire, que la Révolution française a pourtant opposé à l'« arbitraire » de l'Ancien Régime. En d'autres termes : si la VOLONTÉ du PEUPLE souhaite un régime national-socialiste à 99%, qui es-tu pour leur imposer ton diktat ?\n\nPour répondre à ta question, non, je ne suis pas catholique ; lorsque je me réfère à la Tradition, cela dépasse les religions. Quant aux vues de l'Église sur l'immigration, tu fais sans doute référence à la constitution apostolique Exsul familia nazarethana. Pie XII y est plus nuancé que ce que tu veux bien croire :\n\n« Le Créateur de l'univers, en effet, a établi toutes choses, en premier lieu, pour l'utilité de tous ; c'est pourquoi la domination de chaque nation, bien qu'elle doive être respectée, ne peut être exagérée au point que, si un endroit quelconque de la terre offre la possibilité de faire vivre un grand nombre d'hommes, on n'en interdira pas, pour des motifs insuffisants et pour des causes non justifiées, l'accès à des étrangers nécessiteux et honnêtes, sauf s'il existe des motifs d'utilité publique, à peser avec le plus grand scrupule. » (Exsul familia nazarethana ; http://www.clerus.org/bibliaclerusonline/pt/crz.htm)\n\nPlus tard, Jean-Paul II dira dans Laborem exercens :\n\n« Et pourtant, même si l'émigration est sous certains aspects un mal, celui-ci est, en des circonstances déterminées, ce que l'on appelle un mal nécessaire. » (Laborem exercens ; https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/fr/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091981_laborem-exercens.html)\n\nMais aussi :\n\n« On ne peut donc pas, a priori, considérer toute émigration comme un fait positif, à rechercher ou à promouvoir. »\n- Jean-Paul II, discours aux participants au Congrès mondial de la pastorale de l'émigration (https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/fr/speeches/1985/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19851017_pastorale-emigrazione.html)\n\nQuand tu évoques la censure contre les « mensonges de mauvaise foi », tu penses sans doute à la loi Gayssot. Sache que si celle-ci avait été en vigueur dans les années 1960, Henri de Montfort n'aurait jamais pu publier Le Massacre de Katyn, qui démontrait que les Soviétiques en étaient les perpétrateurs, et pas les Allemands. Il aurait risqué 5 ans d'emprisonnement et 45 000 euros d'amende. Les lois mémorielles, qui prétendent figer une vérité historique, sont un obstacle au développement de la connaissance.\n\nMon autodépréciation était purement rhétorique, de même d'ailleurs que toutes les remarques désobligeantes que j'ai pu t'adresser. Au fond je fais la même chose que toi : on grossit le trait pour faire réfléchir, dans une surenchère qui sied à l'échange par messages interposés ou qui, dans le pire des cas, amusera la galerie, ce qui est toujours bon à prendre. Malgré tous les désaccords qui puissent nous diviser sur telle ou telle question, tu es très manifestement doté d'un esprit critique que tu ne laisses pas s'émousser, et ça, en plus de te mettre de facto au-dessus des 90% de moutons de Panurge qui forment l'humanité, c'est un don de la nature qui t'empêchera toujours de t'égarer trop, alors je ne me fais pas trop de souci.\n\n« Le problème avec les gens qui appellent la tyrannie de leurs voeux, c'est qu'ils partent tous du postulat que le tyran sera toujours d'accord avec eux et va faire tout ce qu'ils veulent eux, ce qui leur permettra d'obtenir satisfaction sans devoir au préalable convaincre les autres. »\n\nEn souhaitant priver de liberté tes ennemis au motif qu'ils haïraient la liberté, tu corresponds en tout point à la définition du tyran. Tu peux être certain que les despotes ont toujours un noble alibi pour se débarrasser des gens qui ne leur plaisent pas. Après tout, ceux qui ont la stupidité de se dresser contre leurs utopies ne peuvent être que des fous ou des criminels, et doivent donc être logiquement traités comme tels...'",

Les flux seraient sans doute plus importants ; de fait, le Pape appelle justement à ce qu'on fasse plus d'efforts pour les migrants. Je pourrais élaborer, mais ce n'est pas très utile si ce n'est pas ta religion.Je peux entendre que tu penses que la liberté d'expression est au final imposée par la force de façon quelque peu arbitraire. En poussant un peu, que c'est un concept qui est fondamentalement auto-destructeur et ne peut subsister qu'artificiellement. Je suis prêt à l'admettre, c'est sans doute vrai.A priori, la seule véritable \"loi naturelle\" que connaisse notre Univers est la loi de la force. La loi de la jungle est sa fille naturelle, mais celle-ci conduit fatalement au chaos, à la violence, à l'incertitude permanente : à l'Enfer.Donc même elle est auto-destructrice (du moins en apparence) dans le sens où la grande majorité des gens n'en veulent pas et/ou se regroupent pour échapper à toutes ses conséquences, et les groupes organisés ont tendance à devenir matériellement plus forts. Imposer des lois, même bancales, tend à maximiser cette puissance et c'est ce qu'ils font. Ce faisant, ils balaient la loi de la jungle pure &amp; brute ; tout du moins, elle se manifeste sous d'autres formes. La force peut toujours tout renverser, c'est inévitable, mais cette force devient plus difficile à réunir.Pour maximiser le bien-être &amp; l'Utilité , toute organisation sociale est condamnée à recourir à des abstractions, des fictions, de faire des compromis avec la pureté des concepts &amp; la logique pure. Même un Reich nazi ou la Corée du Nord.Le débat porte en réalité sur là où l'on désire placer le curseur. Sur quelles abstractions, plus ou moins bancales, doivent s'imposer.J'estime que la liberté d'expression est l'abstraction qui maximise le plus l'Utilité, qu'elle est également plus morale (principe de ne pas infliger à autrui ce dont on ne voudrait souffrir soi-même, de ne pas priver les générations futures d'un droit dont on a joui soi-même) que sa négation.Bien sûr que limiter ou refuser la liberté d'expression d'un individu au motif qu'il y est opposé constitue une entorse au principe, c'est pour cette raison que la position que je défends a justement a été qualifiée de paradoxe de la tolérance.Se laisser détruire par l'intolérance serait un paradoxe encore plus grand et encore plus dommageable que celui de ne pas tolérer l'intolérance.On pourrait tenir le même raisonnement au sujet des terroristes qu'il est nécessaire de tuer pour les empêcher de tuer plus de victimes.Selon moi, cette logique se tient. Bien sûr ma position a sa part de subjectivité, mais c'est inévitable &amp; je l'assume.Celui qui est combat la liberté d'expression implique que nécessairement que l'expression n'est pas un droit, mais quelque chose qui peut être pris ou accordé, ou non, par la force.Il devrait donc logiquement assumer être condamné à devoir employer la force pour l'abolir, pour contrôler l'expression d'autrui. S'il n'a pas cette force, il ne reste plus qu'à œuvrer pour l'obtenir. Mais en aucun cas il ne peut décemment reprocher à la société de se défendre en lui opposant sa propre logique, les règles du jeu qu'il choisit &amp; prône lui-même. A défaut, lui-même se contredit.Je ne veux aucunement empêcher mes opposants de s'exprimer, juste de détruire les libertés fondamentales ou de confisquer le pouvoir au peuple pour toujours.Ca laisse quand même beaucoup de marge et s'il y avait un autre moyen de parvenir à ces objectifs que de faire une entorse aux principes qu'ils veulent détruire, je le privilégierais.Blâmer les soviétiques pour Katyn aurait été possible même avec la loi Gayssot. Elle a justement été rédigée de sorte à ne pas entraver le travail des historiens, mais de punir uniquement les négateurs de mauvaise foi au sujet de faits établis avec une pleine certitude.",
