The attack unfolded in the third-floor game room around 10.40pm on Saturday when one person pulled a knife on the other.The suspect fled the restaurant after the attack but was arrested a short time later, reports the New York Post. The victim was rushed to St. Luke‚Äôs Roosevelt Hospital where they were pronounced dead. The motive for the crime has not been made public nor is it clear if the two people involved in the stabbing knew each other. According to the New York Police Department, the city has seen a more than 40 percent rise in major crimes in the past month, compared to the same period in 2021. In January 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams unveiled a comprehensive plan to combat surge in crime. That included increased foot patrols as well as the revival of a plain clothes unit named Neighborhood Safety Teams. The Dave and Busters stabbing is the second stabbing to occur in Times Square in less than 24 hours. In the early hours of April 30 a man was stabbed at a hot dog stand in the area. His condition was unknown. In May 2021, a man was mugged also on the third floor of the restaurant at 6 p.m., reported the New York Post at the time. On the day of the Dave & Busters stabbing, Mayor Eric Adams spoke about efforts to to reduce crime, saying: 'We also want to raise the expectations of our schools, of our [Human Resources Administration], of our Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. We constantly have the police officers under scrutiny. It‚Äôs time for everybody to be under scrutiny.'",

It is impossible that they don't know about the Jewish role in everything, but they intentionally hide it.

According to CBS Sports, the tweet was intended to make fun of NASCAR driver Kyle Larson, who caused a crash at last weekend‚Äôs race at Talladega Speedway.Larson, who is half-Japanese, caused Kurt Busch and Bubba Wallace to crash at the end of the race after attempting to pass the race leader on the final lap. Busch and Wallace both race for 23XI, which is co-owned by Hamlin.Hamlin deleted the initial tweet and apologized on Monday.‚ÄúI took down a post I made earlier today after reading some of the comments,‚Äù Hamlin said. ‚ÄúIt was a poor choice of memes and I saw how it was offensive. It came across totally wrong. I apologize.‚Äù",

Didn‚Äôt we force out demons and do many miracles by the power and authority of your name?‚Äô 23 Then I will tell them publicly, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve never known you. Get away from me, you evil people.‚Äô(‚Äù)2 Timothy 3:5 (GW)They will appear to have a godly life, but they will not let its power change them. Stay away from such people.https://www.biblegateway.com/Cults and false religions in a nutshell, right there. Meanwhile, forever‚Äôs a long time.Tends to make one wonder why people gamble like that.There are literally dozens of each, cults and false religions. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that ‚Äúsalvation by works‚Äù stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it‚Äôs Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah, again the Hebrew Roots Movement and again Roman Catholicism. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, both Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of cults and those false religions.A ‚Äúcult‚Äù is deemed so since it claims to have faith in Jesus but it fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Christ or His Resurrection. There‚Äôs also ALWAYS someone else as a ‚Äúleader‚Äù.
