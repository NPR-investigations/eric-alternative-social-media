The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

First, Dave shares a clip of a reporter trying to push lies about the parental rights in education bill on Ron DeSantis. He obviously didn’t expect to be corrected on what the bill actually says about sex education for young children. At least the he wasn’t one of the shameless Florida Democrats singing to fight the “don't say gay bill”. Next, Ron DeSantis gives a brutal response to the accusations of bullying students at the University of South Florida over wearing masks. This is much different than NY Governor Kathy Hochul’s fear of people being bullied for deciding to wear masks after the lifting of indoor mask mandates. Finally, NYC Mayor Eric Adams is being protested for his toddler mask mandate that some are calling “child abuse”. While Adams lifted school mask mandates for children over the age of 5, he refuses to lift them for 4 and under. For anyone wondering how to get your toddler to wear a mask, Eric Adams has some tips. Meanwhile Florida is taking a different path where the Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo is openly discussing how there is no scientific research to justify cloth mask wearing. He is also making sure that doctors are not forced to only follow the recommendations of the CDC or Dr. Fauci.

First, Dave shares a clip of a reporter trying to push lies about the parental rights in education bill on Ron DeSantis. He obviously didn’t expect to be corrected on what the bill actually says about sex education for young children. At least the he wasn’t one of the shameless Florida Democrats singing to fight the “don't say gay bill”. Next, Ron DeSantis gives a brutal response to the accusations of bullying students at the University of South Florida over wearing masks. This is much different than NY Governor Kathy Hochul’s fear of people being bullied for deciding to wear masks after the lifting of indoor mask mandates. Finally, NYC Mayor Eric Adams is being protested for his toddler mask mandate that some are calling “child abuse”. While Adams lifted school mask mandates for children over the age of 5, he refuses to lift them for 4 and under. For anyone wondering how to get your toddler to wear a mask, Eric Adams has some tips. Meanwhile Florida is taking a different path where the Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo is openly discussing how there is no scientific research to justify cloth mask wearing. He is also making sure that doctors are not forced to only follow the recommendations of the CDC or Dr. Fauci.

We began as a &quot;NextDoor&quot; group, but got fed up with Big Brother censoring our messages.<br />If you are a conservative and love Donald Trump,  and can get along, you are welcome here. Do not be offended if you are gently advised to &quot;be nice&quot; as we all tend to like to argue. Just not here. 😊😊<br />You dont HAVE to be a Christian to be part of the group, but the Deity of Jesus is accepted as a fact here.<br />Welcome.<\/p>",

Kids no longer have to wear masks at schools. Mayor Eric Adams, however, is still requiring children in daycare and pre-school to wear them. Why? The official reason according to Adams is that there is no vaccine available for the toddlers and prudence dictates that, according to the Mayor, they continue obstructing their faces with a frequently filthy barrier to communication and learning that has no demonstrable effect on stopping Covid.     Almost half of all the children in New York State are in the City, and New York City mayors always think of themselves as Governors or Presidents in waiting.      Please call Mayor Adams' office and leave a message that it is time for the masks to come off the toddlers too. Dial 311 in the five boros or 212 339-9675 (212-NEW-YORK) outside NYC.

Unchecked, it’s an electoral death sentence for Mayor Eric Adams and fair elections in New York City.The war on election fairness is being waged on two fronts — one in broad daylight, and the other from the shadows. In both cases, the vehicle for the radical takeover of New York is the city’s failed Board of Elections.In the daylight war, Mr. Adams in January allowed radical City Council legislation granting 800,000 noncitizens the right to vote in local elections to pass into law. Any noncitizen who is legally documented and a resident for 30 days — 30 days! — can vote in contests for mayor, City Council, comptroller, public advocate and borough presidents. The Board of Elections is tasked with managing the hundreds of thousands of new noncitizen voters. In the shadow war, Mr. Adams is mute while possibly thousands of voters remain illegally on voter rolls. Under federal law, the National Voter Registration Act, the states must make “a reasonable effort” to remove from voting rolls “the names of ineligible voters” who have been disqualified from voting due to death or failure to provide notification of change of residence. The Board is responsible for keeping voter rolls honest.",

As I said at that link, “U.S. President Barack Obama had become desperate for something to happen that would persuade German Chancellor Angela Merkel to endorse added sanctions against Russia regarding Ukraine, but I had had no idea, until now, as to what direct involvement, if any, he had had in the actual setting-up of the MH17 shoot-down.” But he has hardly been alone in this effort. Not only Barack Obama but also now Donald Trump are implicated in it — Trump for his continuing Obama’s guilt in it and cover-ups about it. The U.S. is a bipartisan dictatorship. Is that opinion? It is all documented, in the links. This (like the U.S. Government’s having been behind Ukraine’s downing of the MH17) is therefore still news instead of history; but it remains news only because it still remains hidden in the U.S. and its allied regimes; it is NOT “opinion.” It will remain news as long as the U.S.-and-allied blackout of the evidence remains in effect. And the U.S. dictatorship has long been not only domestic but international as well, a dictatorship over what it calls its ‘allies’ and even over some countries which claim to to be ‘neutral’. Another example of this international dictatorship is that the supposedly U.N.-authorized and not U.S.-controlled OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), which is really controlled by the U.S. Government, routinely lies when it needs to in order to protect the U.S. Government from being publicly revealed to have perpetrated an international war-crime.",

The same exact MSM that still pushes the quaccines as \"safe and effective\" and shames people who point out the extremely high numbers of deaths and adverse reactions, and VAIDS. The same exact MSM that set up and mainta9ned the narratives for all wars going back to and like including very much the second world War. The same MSM who tried to shame everyone for calling out the obviously stolen election and down ballot election thefts. Same media who claimed that Trump colluded with Russia to steal and election, have air time almost 24/7 to the swamp lies about their \"investigations\" into it. Same MSM who called Jan 6 an insurrection by terrorists. Same MSM who refuses to talk about the Biden family ties to CCP and Ukraine that has made them all incredibly wealthy even with a maddening amount of evidence from both of Hunter Biden's laptops. Same MSM who refuses to speak at all about Anthony Weiner's laptop. Same MSM who pretends that Jeffrey Epstien killed himself. Same MSM who ran cover for Hillary Clinton and her emails kept on an unclassified server.SameSM who ignored Fast and Furious and Benghazi.Same MSM who ignored the targeting of tea party groups by the IRS under directions from Obama.Same MSM who ignored the tarmac meeting between Bill and Susan Rice.Same exact MSM who buries child sex trafficking and pedophiles in power stories. Same exact MSM who refused to look into Biden and quid pro quo pressuring Ukraine to fire the prosecutor that was investigating his own son.Same exact MSM who refuses to acknowledge that the Trump campaign and presidency was spied upon by DNC party operatives, in Obamagate, for Hillary and Barack, under orders from BHO with Eric Holder, Susan Rice, Hillary and Biden all present when those orders were given.I could go on for hours...That same MSM now all of a sudden we are supposed to believe is telling the truth about the Ukraine conflict???",
