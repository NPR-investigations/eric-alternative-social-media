            "description": "Nehming Names on Gab: 'CTRL+LEFT\n\nProgressives are, by and large, psychologically and spiritually alienated, meaning they feel little to no sympathetic or affective connection to God or their fellow man outside their narrow ideological tribe. You can hear it in their dismissive and mocking rhetoric of others: Fly-over country, hillbillies, rednecks, Jesus-freaks, fascists, racists, etc.\n\nAs a result of their alienation, progressives have a sense that human society is fundamentally hostile and disordered and that their fellow man is at best a latent threat.  This leads to two patterns of behavior.  First is a revolutionary spirit that speculatively seeks to remake the world in such a way to ensure what they would consider to be hostile and disordered forces are permanently eliminated. The second is a deep seated compulsion to control people's lives, thoughts, and behaviors, a characteristic that the philosopher Eric Voegelin, tipping his hat to Church Fathers like St. Augustine, called libido dominandi.\n\nThe upshot of their alienation is this: progressives will always attempt to regulate, manipulate, and dominate others as a way to enforce their vision of the world, and upon noncompliance, they will seek their complete exclusion from society if not their total destruction.\n\nSources of Alienation\n\nOne issue that arises when speaking of alienation is simply this: What is its source?\n\nThe problem is, there is no single source. If there is an overarching theme, then perhaps it's this: alienation arises when the economy of loving and being loved is somehow broken.\n\nSometimes, the alienation is intrinsic to the person: from neuroses or personality disorders preventing the individual from either loving or feeling worthy of being loved.\n\nSometimes, it is from a deep wound from a relationship that by rights should have been loving, but wasn't. It might due to an abusive or overbearing father, or a hypercritical or alcoholic mother. It could arise from the betrayal of a spouse, or a cycle of loveless or abusive physical relationships.\n\nSometimes, it comes from the feeling that one is in a group that is constantly embattled within society. Conversely, it could come from being captive within a group that somehow is beset by pathologies of its own making.\n\nSometimes, alienation is specifically cultivated among people by the unscrupulous who see the alienation as a source of angry and vengeful political action that they can exploit for political power.\n\nThere is a way out of alienation but it requires sacrificial love, a deference for the truth, a respect of human frailty, and a commitment to merciful forgiveness. At that point, human concord can flourish, with friendship and trust growing among those previously set apart through alienation.'",

Ta esitas selle v√§ite Brightoni 6. detsembri episoodi ajal.  Telesaade ‚ÄúLawfare with Tom Renz @ThomasRenz‚Äù, kus ta t√§itis saatejuhi ja Ohio advokaadi Tom Renzi koha.  Nepute j√µudis pealkirjadesse p√§rast seda, kui F√∂deraalne Kaubanduskomisjon (FTC) m√§√§ras talle 500 miljardi dollari suuruse trahvi D-vitamiini ja tsingi propageerimise eest COVID-19 vastu. Ta s√º√ºdistas f√∂deraalvalitsust tema esimese muudatuse √µiguse mahasurumises, sulgedes tema v√µimaluse r√§√§kida tsingi ja D-vitamiini kasulikkusest. Lisaks 500 miljardi dollari suurusele trahvile √ºtles Nepute, et Washington sulges viis tema pangakontot ja esitas tema vastu petturlikke avaldusi.  . Tsiteerides teadlaste m√§rkusi, √ºtles kiropraktik, et D-vitamiin oleks v√µinud potentsiaalselt √§ra hoida 2020. aastal neli miljonit COVID-19 nakatumist. Lisaks oleks D-vitamiin v√µinud samal aastal √§ra hoida 116 000 ameeriklase surma. \"Neli miljonit, see on meeletu arv,\" √ºtles Nepute.  \"Nad surusid selle teabe alla ja tsenseerisid ning inimesed kannatasid ja surid selle t√µttu. Kiropraktiku s√µnul on 101 meditsiiniajakirja uuringut, mis propageerivad D-vitamiini kasulikkust COVID-19 vastu.  Samal ajal on √ºle 70 uuringu n√§idanud tsingi kasulikkust sama haiguse vastu. \"Teadlased on nendes uuringutes leidnud, et sobivas koguses tsingi v√µtmine v√µib v√§hendada viiruskoormust ja nendel juhtudel v√µib tegelikult v√§hendada COVID-19 surmariski 40 protsenti,\" √ºtles ta. ‚ÄûKui palju miljoneid COVID-19 juhtumeid oleksime saanud √§ra hoida ja kui palju miljoneid surmajuhtumeid saaks kogu maailmas √§ra hoida, kui seda teavet ei surutaks maha ega tsenseeritaks?  Kui palju inimesi suri sellep√§rast, et nad valetasid, ja kui palju inimesi suri sellep√§rast, et nad surusid t√µe alla? Nepute: D-vitamiin, tsink on m√§ngu muutjad Nepute j√§tkas, et kui poliitikud ja arstid oleksid pooldanud D-vitamiini kasulikkust, oleks k√µrge COVID-19 suremus elanikkonna hulgas √§ra hoitud.  Uuringute p√µhjal on 50 protsendil Ameerika elanikkonnast D-vitamiini puudus. See puudus on suurem afroameeriklastel, kellest 82 protsendil puudub ‚Äûp√§ikesevitamiin‚Äù. Samuti kritiseeris ta tavaarste, riiklikke tervishoiuinstituute ja teisi ametiasutusi, et nad ei r√§√§gi tsingi kasulikkusest.  Mineraal oli surnud dr Vladimir ‚ÄúZev‚Äù Zelenko @ZFoundationi leiutatud COVID-19 vastase Zelenko protokolli v√µtmesammas. ‚ÄúSee on kirstunael.  D-vitamiin ja tsink muudavad m√§ngu.  See kombinatsioon aitab inimestel v√§hendada infektsioone, viiruskoormust, aitab nende kehal elada √µnnelikumalt, tervemalt ja rikkalikumalt.  Nad valetasid ja inimesed surid,‚Äù r√§√§kis Nepute. Saatejuht \"Real Talk with Dr Eric Nepute\" pidas ka \"vaktsineerimata inimeste pandeemiat\" valeks, kuna rohkem vaktsineeritud inimesi haigestus ja suri COVID-19 t√µttu.  Ta noomis tervishoiu- ja inimteenuste osakonda ning kohalikke tervishoiuosakondi, et nad j√§tkasid COVID-19 vaktsiinide kohta valetamist, reklaamides sotsiaalmeedias, televisioonis ja raadios, et julgustada inimesi end vaktsineerima. Nepute s√µnul peaksid FTC ja justiitsministeerium j√§litama neid, kes COVID-19 vaktsiinide kohta valetasid ja neist kasu said, mis on otsene COVID-19 tarbijakaitseseaduse rikkumine.  Ta lisas, et f√∂deraalvalitsus ja Big Tech tegid kokkum√§ngu, et suruda alla ja tsenseerida t√µde COVID-19 kohta. Nepute l√µpetas meeldetuletuse ja hoiatusega ‚Äì p√µhiseadus on endiselt maa seadus ning valitsus ja selle kaass√µdurid peavad tehtu eest maksma. https://www.brighteon.com/81e3ece3-1207-40ce-9286-685bb2e03b74",

          "content": "Sadly, many in today‚Äôs itchy ears ‚Äúmodern society‚Äù say something like, ‚ÄúYeah, well, I said the ‚ÄòSinner‚Äôs Prayer‚Äô back in 1974 so I‚Äôm good.‚ÄùWhere‚Äôs the ‚Äòrepentance‚Äô part? It needs to be the correct ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù as well. Almost all false religions, unfortunately, go as far as to even have NO Jesus.A ‚Äúcult‚Äù is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù, but that‚Äôs another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There‚Äôs ALWAYS someone else as a ‚Äúleader‚Äù. Examples: Charles ‚ÄúTaze‚Äù Russell of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It‚Äôs cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù exists in ANY cult which includes those ‚Äúsalvation by works‚Äù people. It‚Äôs totally impossible to ‚Äúearn a gift‚Äù. No ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù in false religions. One doesn‚Äôt HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn‚Äôt teach anything like either ‚Äúsalvation by works‚Äù or ‚Äúreligion‚Äù (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is ‚ÄúJust Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything‚Äù. (‚ÄúThe Gospel ONLY‚Äù, in other words ‚Äì Keyword: ‚ÄúONLY‚Äù). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We‚Äôre under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren‚Äôt robots. Forever‚Äôs a long time.Forever‚Äôs a long time.‚ÄúSalvation by works‚Äù never works. No one is saved BY good works but rather UNTO them.

          "content": "Pennsylvania: Neo-Nazi Parents Angry After 6th Graders Taken to Drag ShowSnake Baker December 14, 2022The fact is, kids need to learn how to take it up the ass.If they don‚Äôt learn from professionals, they‚Äôre going to teach themselves how to do it, and this could very well result in anal tearing.The Post Millennial:---------------------------------------------------------------------------A group of Pennsylvania parents were surprised to learn recently that their children had been taken to see a drag queen performing in a pantomime rendition of Alice in Wonderland.The People‚Äôs Light Theater performance is advertised for ages 5 to 105 and features a drag queen who goes by the name of Eric Jaffe. On the Chester County theater‚Äôs website, Jaffe is referred to using female pronouns and described as a ‚Äúgenderfull glamour monster.‚ÄùAccording to Broad and Liberty, parents were not explicitly informed about the drag performer being part of the show, and only became aware of the fact after some children told their parents that they had been made to wear masks for the event. This prompted parents to investigate the outing at which point they discovered that not only was a drag queen one of the stars of the show, but also that the theater was promoting this particular character above all others.A Facebook post about the event highlights the split opinion that surrounds exposing children to the adult form of entertainment that is drag. While most who commented were opposed to the choice of school outing, some took to Facebook to defend the decision.‚ÄúWCASD did list the show name on permissions slips. I do agree that there should have been advance notice provided by the school about People‚Äôs Light mask policy. But I genuinely don‚Äôt understand the rest of your argument. The Dame is another element of the panto and has been, again, for centuries. Sir Ian McKellan has been a Dame.‚ÄùBut that‚Äôs only partially correct. The pantomime Dame has been around for centuries, but Dames are not drag queens. The pantomime Dame tradition requires that the character be obviously a man wearing a dress, without glamour or sparkles.For Sir Ian McKellan, playing a Dame was not about impersonating a woman.‚ÄúIn my case, playing dame certainly won‚Äôt be a female impersonation: with my hands, how could it be? I‚Äôll be appearing in frocks, with padding to give me a female body shape, but I‚Äôm certainly not pretending to be a woman. I‚Äôm approaching it more in the tradition of the stand-up comic who puts a frock on,‚Äù said McKellan in an interview with the Guardian at the time.Star of the show Jaffe however told local news that the performance is being ‚Äúmisrepresented‚Äù which the drag performer suggests could be because people have ‚Äúnever met a transgender or gender fluid person before.‚Äù‚ÄúAll that they know about those people is what they see in the media and what plays on TV, and so having those people represented fairly and equitably is important,‚Äù said Jaffe. ‚ÄúKids are introduced to gender norms so early, without even you telling them, just from the media that they intake.

          "contentraw": "Pennsylvania: Neo-Nazi Parents Angry After 6th Graders Taken to Drag Show<br /><br />Snake Baker <br />December 14, 2022<br /><br />The fact is, kids need to learn how to take it up the ass.<br /><br />If they don‚Äôt learn from professionals, they‚Äôre going to teach themselves how to do it, and this could very well result in anal tearing.<br /><br />The Post Millennial:<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />A group of Pennsylvania parents were surprised to learn recently that their children had been taken to see a drag queen performing in a pantomime rendition of Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />The People‚Äôs Light Theater performance is advertised for ages 5 to 105 and features a drag queen who goes by the name of Eric Jaffe. On the Chester County theater‚Äôs website, Jaffe is referred to using female pronouns and described as a ‚Äúgenderfull glamour monster.‚Äù<br /><br />According to Broad and Liberty, parents were not explicitly informed about the drag performer being part of the show, and only became aware of the fact after some children told their parents that they had been made to wear masks for the event. This prompted parents to investigate the outing at which point they discovered that not only was a drag queen one of the stars of the show, but also that the theater was promoting this particular character above all others.<br /><br />A Facebook post about the event highlights the split opinion that surrounds exposing children to the adult form of entertainment that is drag. While most who commented were opposed to the choice of school outing, some took to Facebook to defend the decision.<br /><br />‚ÄúWCASD did list the show name on permissions slips. I do agree that there should have been advance notice provided by the school about People‚Äôs Light mask policy. But I genuinely don‚Äôt understand the rest of your argument. The Dame is another element of the panto and has been, again, for centuries. Sir Ian McKellan has been a Dame.‚Äù<br /><br />But that‚Äôs only partially correct. The pantomime Dame has been around for centuries, but Dames are not drag queens. The pantomime Dame tradition requires that the character be obviously a man wearing a dress, without glamour or sparkles.<br /><br />For Sir Ian McKellan, playing a Dame was not about impersonating a woman.<br /><br />‚ÄúIn my case, playing dame certainly won‚Äôt be a female impersonation: with my hands, how could it be? I‚Äôll be appearing in frocks, with padding to give me a female body shape, but I‚Äôm certainly not pretending to be a woman. I‚Äôm approaching it more in the tradition of the stand-up comic who puts a frock on,‚Äù said McKellan in an interview with the Guardian at the time.<br /><br />Star of the show Jaffe however told local news that the performance is being ‚Äúmisrepresented‚Äù which the drag performer suggests could be because people have ‚Äúnever met a transgender or gender fluid person before.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúAll that they know about those people is what they see in the media and what plays on TV, and so having those people represented fairly and equitably is important,‚Äù said Jaffe. <br /><br />‚ÄúKids are introduced to gender norms so early, without even you telling them, just from the media that they intake. So since they already have so much knowledge that comes from one side of the gender spectrum, it really is no different to allow them to experience the other side.‚Äù<br /><br />The pantomime Dame tradition was never about educating children about gender identities and the gender spectrum.
