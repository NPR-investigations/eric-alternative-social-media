Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language will be removed.

CONSIDER the masses of like-minded rational patriots that stand shoulder to shoulder with you, united above all elitists! UNDERSTAND we are the true elite and we must mobilize to preserve this institution and save this republic!\r\n*****************************************************************************\r\nONCE UPON A TIME Rush Limbaugh was determined to create a radio platform that preached the gospel of conservatism while exposing the mayhem of liberalism. The success ignited a sleeping giant DITTO to a movement today called MAGA! It revived AM radio and mentored other talk show hosts to spread the conservative gospel across the fruited plains. Talk radio is now an American institution!  SADLY Rush passed in 2021, but this group will never forget his unique mind and what he accomplished for this country! And we also honor the great voices of today that lend their talent to keep us informed of the truth against a wayward government. CONSERVATIVE talk radio is the cutting edge of news, and the reliable beacon of truth over a cesspool of irresponsible journalism being practiced today. Just imagine an America today without the torch of conservative talk radio!\r\n \r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\nLOYAL talk radio listeners \"get it\" and belong to this group! Here you can:\r\nENJOY posting and interacting about shows national & local and politics\r\nHIGHLITE segments of shows REVEAL opinions of radio show hosts\r\nRUN polls to monitor host approvals/disapprovals\r\nEVERYTHING talk radio & politics gets discussed here, just please keep it somewhat clean and don’t spam.

Buck had given a total of about $500,000 to a host of Democratic politicians including Ted Lieu, Adam Schiff, Karen Bass, Xavier Becerra, Gavin Newsom and Eric Garcetti.Ed Buck was a small time Democratic donor when compared to LA lawyer Tom Girardi. Over decades of donations, Girardi and his wives donate around $4 million to various Democrats. About half of that money was donated at a time when Girardi’s fortunes were declining.The Los Angeles legal legend was a major party donor for decades, a self-described “limousine liberal” who bragged about the influence his money bought him in the selection of judges. He poured millions into local, state and national races personally and lined up additional donations from his wife, “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Erika; the employees of his law firm; and the multitude of California trial lawyers who did business with him — or hoped to.Girardi kept throwing splashy fundraisers and writing big checks even as his financial situation grew dire. In the last decade, he defaulted on a series of high-interest loans and was forced to liquidate his stock portfolio yet he and his wife still doled out more than $2 million to the national Democratic Party and individual candidates, election filings show.Those receiving funds included presidential contenders Joe Biden ($11,200), Barack Obama ($62,500) and Hillary Clinton ($60,400), Gov.

Other names mentioned in the story include Senators Mark Kelly, Tim Kaine, Claire McCaskill and Representatives Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.The obvious question becomes: Where did Girardi come up with the money? The Times suggests it’s likely it was stolen from settlement money that should have gone to his own clients.Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she had separated a $5,400 donation she received from Girardi and it would eventually go to victims of his fraud. Rep. Adam Schiff said he would give a $2,000 donation he received to legal aid, though he only offered to do that after being contacted by the LA Times. Everyone else is just keeping the money.",

Inflation oblige, elles font des choix difficiles, perdant ici quelques degrés de chauffage, là des heures d'éclairage public. Symboliquement, certaines doivent même sacrifier... les décorations des fêtes de fin d'année, qui font pourtant rêver petits et grands et participent de la magie de cette période.Car la facture des illuminations peut rapidement grimper, en particulier lorsque les équipements sont anciens. Si les données récentes manquent, en décembre 2011, l'Agence de l'environnement et de la maîtrise de l'énergie (Ademe) notait que «la puissance fournie pour les illuminations de Noël est estimée à 1300 MW, dont les 3/4 sont liés à la consommation des ménages». Soit la puissance d'un réacteur nucléaire. «Avec les LED, les consommations unitaires ont drastiquement baissé. Attention cependant à l’effet rebond : comme ça consomme très peu, on en met partout !», nuance aujourd'hui l'Ademe.Pour nombre de communes, les décorations de Noël peuvent représenter une dépense superflue, alors que les comptes sont déjà plombés. Elles «vont avoir, en moyenne, une facture énergétique entre 20% et 30% plus élevée» cette année, rappelle Harold Huwart, maire de Nogent-le-Rotrou (Eure-et-Loir) et vice-président de l'Association des petites villes de France (APVF). Un constat partagé : «Sur le budget électricité, nous serons à 30.000 euros de plus. Sur le gaz, nous avions projeté 341.000 euros, il nous manquera 210.000 euros» en plus, énumère le maire d'Orchies (Nord), Ludovic Rohart. À Rombas, en Moselle, «la facture s'alourdira de 500 à 600.000 euros pour la ville», selon le maire, qui s'alarme d'un «raz-de-marée énergétique et financier».Alors, face à l'explosion des factures et aux appels à la sobriété énergétique, des maires voient d'un mauvais œil le coût des décorations de Noël. Une année normale, le seul budget d'installation des illuminations représente 40.000 euros à Orchies, note son maire. Tout compris, le coût atteint «25.000 à 30.000 euros» à La Roche-Jaudy (Côtes-d'Armor). À Vair-sur-Loire (Loire-Atlantique), Eric Lucas chiffre les décorations à «20.000 euros», un chiffre qui peut atteindre «25.000 euros» à Nogent-le-Rotrou.Des décisions difficiles sont donc prises. À Orchies, une commission réfléchit à la «problématique des fêtes de fin d'année», étudiant plusieurs scénarios, dont un où l'opérateur fournirait des boîtiers pour contrôler la consommation d'électricité, et un autre «où les guirlandes électriques seraient bannies». Ce scénario emporte l'adhésion du maire. À Rombas, la mairie a déjà annoncé une «réduction de plus de 80% des illuminations de Noël», utilisant l'argent économisé pour investir dans le remplacement de l'éclairage public en LED. «Nous avons pris la décision de ne plus mettre d'illumination de Noël, explique de son côté le maire de La Roche-Jaudy, Jean-Louis Even. C'est bien joli d'illuminer les rues, mais quand tout le monde aura froid et qu'il y aura des coupures...». Même décision à Vair-sur-Loire. À Avoriaz, station de ski de Haute-Savoie, la décision n'est pas encore tranchée, indique une représentante de l'office du tourisme. La commune pourrait limiter fortement ses illuminations : «Le but est de garder le charme [...], tout en minimisant l'impact sur l'environnement», plaide-t-on.Dans les petites communes privées d'illumination, les mairies s'organisent pour célébrer la fin d'année autrement. «À La Roche-Jaudy, le père Noël ne sera pas une ordure !», sourit Jean-Louis Even. Sa commune redistribuera l'argent économisé en finançant des subventions pour les foyers souhaitant acheter un poêle à bois. Des fêtes «plus solidaires, sociales, protectrices de l'environnement. Un vrai Noël !», veut croire l'élu. D'autres villes vont mettre à contribution des bénévoles pour construire des décorations visibles de jour, mais non la nuit. D'autres encore réfléchissent à des guirlandes solaires. Nogent-le-Rotrou remisera ses vieilles lampes à décharge au placard, éteindra ses décorations LED au matin et privilégiera des animations.@DemocratieParticipative",

À Rombas, la mairie a déjà annoncé une «réduction de plus de 80% des illuminations de Noël», utilisant l'argent économisé pour investir dans le remplacement de l'éclairage public en LED. «Nous avons pris la décision de ne plus mettre d'illumination de Noël, explique de son côté le maire de La Roche-Jaudy, Jean-Louis Even. C'est bien joli d'illuminer les rues, mais quand tout le monde aura froid et qu'il y aura des coupures...». Même décision à Vair-sur-Loire. À Avoriaz, station de ski de Haute-Savoie, la décision n'est pas encore tranchée, indique une représentante de l'office du tourisme. La commune pourrait limiter fortement ses illuminations : «Le but est de garder le charme [...], tout en minimisant l'impact sur l'environnement», plaide-t-on.<br /><br />Dans les petites communes privées d'illumination, les mairies s'organisent pour célébrer la fin d'année autrement. «À La Roche-Jaudy, le père Noël ne sera pas une ordure !», sourit Jean-Louis Even. Sa commune redistribuera l'argent économisé en finançant des subventions pour les foyers souhaitant acheter un poêle à bois. Des fêtes «plus solidaires, sociales, protectrices de l'environnement. Un vrai Noël !», veut croire l'élu. D'autres villes vont mettre à contribution des bénévoles pour construire des décorations visibles de jour, mais non la nuit. D'autres encore réfléchissent à des guirlandes solaires. Nogent-le-Rotrou remisera ses vieilles lampes à décharge au placard, éteindra ses décorations LED au matin et privilégiera des animations.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/DemocratieParticipative\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@DemocratieParticipative<\/a>",
