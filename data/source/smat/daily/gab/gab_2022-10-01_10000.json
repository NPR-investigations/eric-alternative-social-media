This goes beyond anything that has been done before. Fashion week has featured a 10-year-old \"Transgender\" child, who was touted as an example of how \"progressive\" and \"woke\" the organization is. Noella McMaher is 10 years old, and both of her parents are also transgender. She is the victim of child abuse, and transgender indoctrination at the hands of her abusive parents, and the fashion week leftists.",

The migrants would be permitted to come and go as they wish while staying on the ship, reports the New York Post, quoting a source said to be familiar with the matter. According to preliminary estimates, the plan to put migrants on a shop will cost less than putting up another tent city, like the one that's under construction in the Bronx at the Orchard Beach parking lot. The Post reported last week that the tent city is projected to cost $15 million a month. The source further said that City Hall is negotiating the use of a shop owned by Estonian-based Tallink. The same ship was used by the Estonian government to house Ukrainians fleeing their country after Russia invaded in February. Approximately 15,000 migrants have come to New York City since May, according to City Hall estimates. City Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli, R-Staten Island, said putting immigrants on a cruise ship makes the best out of the situation, which he blamed on President Joe Biden. \"Until Biden shuts off the border I am not sure how we can continue to accommodate these people without taking over every inch of parkland with tent cities,\" Borelli said. \"This arguably may be a more reasonable way to cope with the crisis than people might think.\"Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., however, called the idea \"ludicrous.\"",

This year’s theme is focused on resisting the effects of Pope Francis’ attack on the Traditional Latin Mass and his promotion of the “Great Reset” agenda.Conference co-host Eric Frankovitch opened the day with harrowing remarks about the lengths that faithful Catholics must be willing to go in order to defend the traditional faith of the Church.After laying out a severe description of the current state of the Church under Pope Francis, Frankovitch brought up the issue of the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) – controversial to some – and how the SSPX may be in a position to consecrate bishops again soon, perhaps without permission from Rome.“No other bishop is going to ordain their priests,” he said, “so they have to have their own.”Recalling Pope John Paul II’s 1988 declaration that Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre had incurred the penalty of excommunication for consecrating bishops without papal approval, and opining that a similar moment may soon come to pass, he said: “All I can say is please, please include me in that excommunication… I’ll stand with Saint Athanasius and Marcel Lefebvre.”“What would we be excommunicated from?” he asked.

Answering his own question he said, “we would be excommunicated by a regime that worships the pachamama.”<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/catholic-identity-conference-opens-with-call-to-resist-pope-francis-and-the-new-world-order/?utm_source=daily-catholic-2022-10-01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>lifesitenews.com/news/catholic-identity-confe<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">rence-opens-with-call-to-resist-pope-francis-and-the-new-world-order/?utm_source=daily-catholic-2022-10-01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><\/p>",

It's corruption based around enforcing ego/personal sensibilities not the Constitution, misplaced loyalties to fraternity, other government officials, instead of Constitutional loyalties, and self protection justification after a mistake has been made. Note only the first is malicious with ego enforcement. The rest are unfortunately things to easy for any human to fall into. It is a sad truth that to often the legitimate concern of officer safety is used as an excuse for these corruptions. I do not mean to down play the concern for officer safety. Since law enforcement is the exclusive enforcement arm of the government they will regularly deal with individuals trying to use force against them and officer safety is a very real, and justified, concern. Their career being what it is there can never be an expectation for complete safety. So how far is it acceptable to go to guarantee an officer's safety? Shouldn't that line be our Constitutionally protected rights? I think, again legitimate and rightly justified, concern for officer safety has turned, at least partially, into a paranoia that has led to a suspicion of individuals enacting their 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendment rights. This suspicion often leads officers to not only violate the rights I previously mentioned but often the 8th Amendment. Beyond there being violations of Constitutionally protected rights there is the 1st Amendment auditor counter movement of individuals becoming more aware and active about their rights and starting to push back by proactively, and though sometimes aggressively, applying their rights. This is usually done to the great aggravation of the officers who often end up enforcing their ego by making the individual take the ride though the individual will beat the wrap. To often these officers hide behind qualified immunity, qualified immunity, like officer safety concerns, has legitimacy but, as with officer safety concerns, is used by bad apples to protect them from any serious reprimand for breaking, or even abusing, the public trust for corrupt reasons, and the fraternal \"blue wall\" of loyalty. I fear the ego enforcement, Judge Dredd/Eric Cartman, mindset will not allow agencies to see this divide happening and, as Americans are notoriously stubborn in their rights, officer's will only double down. Leading to the \"them vs us\" mentality the officer safety paranoia, that is a justified concern, has created to only become further apart. What should be done? Law enforcement probably won't like this but with the foundation, and operation, of our government it falls on the government, or government actors, to be more restrained then the individual citizens. We are country where the government exists based on our consent. We don't suffer kings.",

          "content": "@RobinsHood @Goldie862 @yafer @enessj @Lesane13 @Eric-Dubay TimeAndDate says rainbows can only form if: #1: Sun is above horizon, not obscured by clouds, mountains, or other obstacles. #2: Sun has to be quite low in the sky. If you are at the same elevation as your horizon, sun's altitude must be below 42° to create a rainbow that can be seen from your perspective. #3: Rainbows always appear on side opposite to sun. If you have your back to sun, rainbow will arch in front of you.https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/rainbow.html I am guessing the well documented record breaking 9 hour rainbow in Taiwan literally impossible, according to ball model propaganda. If you take a look here, it destroys almost every argument they have made so far. A: A rainbow forming over a mountainous region can mean rainbow appears both above and below visible horizon as seen here, due to rainbow dropping down below altitude this was recorded on from higher above on mountain, while upper part of rainbow is still above. B: Sun has to be low in the sky. I don't see how 'sun must be below 42° to create a rainbow that can be seen from your perspective' is a valid argument any longer. This rainbow lasted all day. Maybe Taiwan has a stationary sun that never moves, and noon doesn't exist over there? All day rainbow isn't possible, by globe ball rainbow definition. Is it? For comparison, typical rainbows last much less than 1 hr. How is it possible for rainbows to last all day?https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42219665 C: Sun is obscured by clouds, mountains, obstacles as seen in video here, with sometimes top of bow only visible as seen at 0:28, before sun emerges brighter forming a second and higher inverted color bow on top of lower and partially submerged bow. Sun is clearly obscured by clouds, leaving only an escaping solar ray or two to light the bow at times.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H5GesE5LHRk D: Rainbows always appear on side opposite sun. But, how is that possible if sun rises E, sets W on opposite sides within 9 hours? It is possible to see a rainbow on opposite sides of the sun while rising and setting, but also when it's directly above during 9 hour sunset?https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/9-hour-rainbow-sets-new-guinness-record-180968527/ E: Rainbows are formed of water droplets, although we see at 0:16 in video link present in C: that rainbow forms below where heavy cloud cover is present, but also curves above clouds to clearer skies above. Farmer's Almanac says double rainbows are caused by light double refracting through rain droplets. I was wondering how 1 rain drop refracts 2 rainbows into opposing colors with 1 on top of the other, since this would mean both rainbows are projection rainbows, and not directly influenced by surrounding water droplets. This would cause projected light from water droplets to be seen traveling from water droplet to each projected bow due to water vapor between projection droplets and rainbows. We never see projection paths, so it's safe to conclude if caused by only water vapor, it must be directly caused by water droplets within same path as bow. Direct influence. Not indirect projections. Oddly, I was cutting wood with a saw kicking out semi-fine dust one day, and it also formed a rainbow pattern across sawdust cloud streaming from saw while cutting. If rainbows are only caused by refracting light through water vapor, how do saw dust particles form rainbows, as they aren't exactly transparent, killing ball rainbow explanation again. Which raises interesting questions. Can rainbows form from atmospheric gasses, or dust in the air? Apparently, yes, debunking ball model rainbow explanation. Again. They don't know what causes it. Not exactly. Just guesses.https://www.farmersalmanac.com/all-about-rainbows-17600 F: Farmer's Almanac says you can only see circular rainbows looking down with sun behind you, which is only possible from a plane. We know from TimeAndDate previous statement, 'You can only see rainbows on the side opposite the sun,' but here we have a video with clouds passing between observer and sun debunking TimeAndDate as double circle rainbows are seen FACING sun. Farmer's Almanac got debunked also, as they claim 'You can only see circle rainbows looking down with sun behind you, which is only possible on a plane,' but you can clearly see 360° rainbows FACING UP at sun, demolishing lies of ball Earth model's Farmer's Almanac AND TimeAndDate websites.

If you are at the same elevation as your horizon, sun's altitude must be below 42° to create a rainbow that can be seen from your perspective. <br /><br />#3: Rainbows always appear on side opposite to sun. If you have your back to sun, rainbow will arch in front of you.<br /><a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/rainbow.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>timeanddate.com/astronomy/rainbow.html<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <br /><br />I am guessing the well documented record breaking 9 hour rainbow in Taiwan literally impossible, according to ball model propaganda. <br /><br />If you take a look here, it destroys almost every argument they have made so far. <br /><br />A: A rainbow forming over a mountainous region can mean rainbow appears both above and below visible horizon as seen here, due to rainbow dropping down below altitude this was recorded on from higher above on mountain, while upper part of rainbow is still above. <br /><br />B: Sun has to be low in the sky. I don't see how 'sun must be below 42° to create a rainbow that can be seen from your perspective' is a valid argument any longer. This rainbow lasted all day. Maybe Taiwan has a stationary sun that never moves, and noon doesn't exist over there? All day rainbow isn't possible, by globe ball rainbow definition. Is it? For comparison, typical rainbows last much less than 1 hr. How is it possible for rainbows to last all day?<br /><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42219665\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>bbc.com/news/world-asia-42219665<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <br /><br />C: Sun is obscured by clouds, mountains, obstacles as seen in video here, with sometimes top of bow only visible as seen at 0:28, before sun emerges brighter forming a second and higher inverted color bow on top of lower and partially submerged bow. Sun is clearly obscured by clouds, leaving only an escaping solar ray or two to light the bow at times.<br /><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H5GesE5LHRk\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>m.youtube.com/watch?v=H5GesE5LHRk<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <br /><br />D: Rainbows always appear on side opposite sun. But, how is that possible if sun rises E, sets W on opposite sides within 9 hours? It is possible to see a rainbow on opposite sides of the sun while rising and setting, but also when it's directly above during 9 hour sunset?<br /><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/9-hour-rainbow-sets-new-guinness-record-180968527/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/9-hour-rainbow-<span class=\"invisible\">sets-new-guinness-record-180968527/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a> <br /><br />E: Rainbows are formed of water droplets, although we see at 0:16 in video link present in C: that rainbow forms below where heavy cloud cover is present, but also curves above clouds to clearer skies above. <br /><br />Farmer's Almanac says double rainbows are caused by light double refracting through rain droplets. I was wondering how 1 rain drop refracts 2 rainbows into opposing colors with 1 on top of the other, since this would mean both rainbows are projection rainbows, and not directly influenced by surrounding water droplets. <br /><br />This would cause projected light from water droplets to be seen traveling from water droplet to each projected bow due to water vapor between projection droplets and rainbows. We never see projection paths, so it's safe to conclude if caused by only water vapor, it must be directly caused by water droplets within same path as bow. Direct influence. Not indirect projections. <br /><br />Oddly, I was cutting wood with a saw kicking out semi-fine dust one day, and it also formed a rainbow pattern across sawdust cloud streaming from saw while cutting. <br /><br />If rainbows are only caused by refracting light through water vapor, how do saw dust particles form rainbows, as they aren't exactly transparent, killing ball rainbow explanation again. <br /><br />Which raises interesting questions. <br /><br />Can rainbows form from atmospheric gasses, or dust in the air? Apparently, yes, debunking ball model rainbow explanation. Again. They don't know what causes it. Not exactly. Just guesses.<br /><a href=\"https://www.farmersalmanac.com/all-about-rainbows-17600\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>farmersalmanac.com/all-about-rainbows-17600<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <br /><br />F: Farmer's Almanac says you can only see circular rainbows looking down with sun behind you, which is only possible from a plane. <br /><br />We know from TimeAndDate previous statement, 'You can only see rainbows on the side opposite the sun,' but here we have a video with clouds passing between observer and sun debunking TimeAndDate as double circle rainbows are seen FACING sun. <br /><br />Farmer's Almanac got debunked also, as they claim 'You can only see circle rainbows looking down with sun behind you, which is only possible on a plane,' but you can clearly see 360° rainbows FACING UP at sun, demolishing lies of ball Earth model's Farmer's Almanac AND TimeAndDate websites. <br /><br />Circular rainbows over sun at 1:21 in video below.<br /><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JA_9hDJgSV8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>m.youtube.com/watch?v=JA_9hDJgSV8<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <br /><br />It's looking like ball community knows pretty much next to nothing.

We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",
