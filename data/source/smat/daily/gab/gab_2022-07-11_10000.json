That's right. They had a choice. They could easily have said, \"I've had enough of crime. We need some law, order, and safety. I'm going to vote for Curtis Sliwa. At least, we'd have an opportunity to make New York a better place.\"But no. Instead, they said: \"I want more crime, more filth, and more degeneracy. And Eric Adams is the person to deliver us those things!\"",

Bush and Donald Trump win the 2000 and 2016 elections respectively, in the Electoral College, but at the same time, both lost in the national popular vote.Following Trump’s surprise 2016 election victory, liberals, media figures, and Democrats once again called for the elimination of the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote.The MSNBC host claimed the resignation of Johnson “demonstrated once again, the superiority of the British parliamentary system, over the system chosen by our founders.”O’Donnell’s previous statement praising the current British governmental system makes sense for someone promoting Marxism.What makes him and others like him unbearable to me, is the fact that they act out angrily by their inability to do anything about it.Thus the United States is truly divided, and from where I sit, and without any possible solution available for those who want to take on the arduous task of trying to bring both sides back to the political table again.\"No law ever prevented a crime.\" - Anonymous“Didja get that?

Obama said whats he gonna do wave a magic wand to bring back manufacturing to the US, well he brought it back, not only did he bring it back but he encouraged research in the industry did you know in his tenure in office we developed the al-75 and super strength steel and the carbon fiber revolution.

What matters and still does  is he gets shit done and fast and he loves this country and us he really cares who else Reagan , Kennedy so all those who lose faith about whats going on just remember what he did and what his opposition had going on every single day against him and he still thrived imagine what he could do if that opposition weren't there.

His weak point not firing every MF in the established administration from the  get go reducing the CIA and FBI and all the other letter agencies to a skeleton crew..  When he said he got the vaccine to us because of his project warp speed, I was like you cannot rush vaccine development period there are to many trials, in shrot they already had the vaccines ready comeon people the covid virus was patented  years ago and they had been making the vaccines for it for years covid was made for the vaccine not the other way around and all of us who were awake knew it just like we knew the night of the election when they  stopped counting the were cheating on a global scale and none of us who  saw it were surprised except for the length of some states  to wait until they ahd enough phony ballots to make the numbers right, its like fudging an inventory till you can pass..   What matters and still does  is he gets shit done and fast and he loves this country and us he really cares who else Reagan , Kennedy so all those who lose faith about whats going on just remember what he did and what his opposition had going on every single day against him and he still thrived imagine what he could do if that opposition weren't there.  Remember Trump is Jesus's tool  and Jesus is a master tactician never doubt  that.",
