We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",

Here in this group we want to encourage everyone to talk about all of the wonderful things Ron DeSantis has done since being elected Governor.\n\nThings like:\nOutlawing Sanctuary Cities in Florida.\nExpand Florida's E-Verify requirements.\nKeeping Florida open despite the pressure to close it again!\nPrevent local governments from fining people who don't wear masks.\nMaking sure everyone has the option of in person learning.\n\nThe list goes on and on! It is without a doubt that he needs a second term as Governor of Florida and strong consideration for President. I hope everyone enjoys! Speak freely!\n\nAlso feel free to follow me @TheGayRepublican! Much appreciated!",

Interestingly, recently leaked Bilderberg meeting records from the group’s early days—which include detailed accounts of the procedures and talking points from eight Bilderberg meetings in the 1950s, 1960s and in 1980—show that, at least as far back as 1962, the elite Bilderberg attendees were pre-setting the dials for Britain’s entrance into what was then the European Economic Community (EEC).https://www.thetruthhound.com/early-leaked-bilderberg-documents-show-uks-economic-military-future-preordained/RIIA 1% ruling elite deep state inner circle's GCHQ’s mass data interception violated right to privacy, court rulesHuman rights judgment follows legal challenge begun in 2013 after Edward Snowden’s whistleblowing revelationshttps://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/25/gchqs-mass-data-sharing-violated-right-to-privacy-court-rulesCFR mbr NSA spook Jared Cohen addresses the MI6/GCHQ spooks at Council on Foreign Relations UK sister organization Chatham House https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpk0AMKm_LQthese scum use our tax dollars to spy on us https://tinyurl.com/3jjdh76pCFR's Jared Cohen censorship project Jigsaw https://tinyurl.com/mryb9p6uCFR using Google to take over the internethttps://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/What Is Google’s Relationship With the NSA? 2014 CFR'S Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen limited hangout https://tinyurl.com/ybaqezdfGoogle’s Regime Change Agent Jared Cohen https://tinyurl.com/ydrzb233Clinton emails show how Google's CFR idea director Jared Cohen collaborated with CFR run US State Department to try to oust Assad https://tinyurl.com/3nccj3y8https://tinyurl.com/ycvovvqx https://tinyurl.com/ybj6kkteThe Banality of Don’t Do Evil https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/the-banality-of-dont-be-evil-the-cfr/Google's Regime Change Agents @CFR members Jared Cohen &amp; Eric Schmidt Engineer a Regime Changehttps://tinyurl.com/ydrzb233peter-thiel-sam-altman.htmlSam Altman &amp; Bilderberghttps://time.com/4362872/bilderberg-group-meetings-2016-conspiracy-theories/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12]https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm",

Interestingly, recently leaked Bilderberg meeting records from the group’s early days—which include detailed accounts of the procedures and talking points from eight Bilderberg meetings in the 1950s, 1960s and in 1980—show that, at least as far back as 1962, the elite Bilderberg attendees were pre-setting the dials for Britain’s entrance into what was then the European Economic Community (EEC).<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.thetruthhound.com/early-leaked-bilderberg-documents-show-uks-economic-military-future-preordained/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thetruthhound.com/early-leaked-bilderberg-doc<span class=\"invisible\">uments-show-uks-economic-military-future-preordained/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />RIIA 1% ruling elite deep state inner circle's GCHQ’s mass data interception violated right to privacy, court rules<br />Human rights judgment follows legal challenge begun in 2013 after Edward Snowden’s whistleblowing revelations<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/25/gchqs-mass-data-sharing-violated-right-to-privacy-court-rules\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/25/gchqs-mas<span class=\"invisible\">s-data-sharing-violated-right-to-privacy-court-rules<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br /><br />CFR mbr NSA spook Jared Cohen addresses the MI6/GCHQ spooks at Council on Foreign Relations UK sister organization Chatham House <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpk0AMKm_LQ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>youtube.com/watch?v=Tpk0AMKm_LQ<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />these scum use our tax dollars to spy on us <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/3jjdh76p\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tinyurl.com/3jjdh76p<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />CFR's Jared Cohen censorship project Jigsaw <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/mryb9p6u\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tinyurl.com/mryb9p6u<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />CFR using Google to take over the internet<br /><a href=\"https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />What Is Google’s Relationship With the NSA?

It changed her, and when she got out of the hospital, she came back online to find us and apologize, she thought they were just putting on a act of being tough. <br /><br />On the Friday night before the shooting, they came in our chat room seeking to harass me and about 5 or 6 others, we made knew rooms and they kept finding us, and Eric getting pissed off at people ignoring him, he said they were going to be the biggest mass murderers in history, and right away I said it's not possible, Stalin a Pol Pot killed millions, and he kept claiming they will kill more and become famous, so I told him that after the first person he shoots then watches in their eyes as they die, they will turn the guns on themselves and kill themselves, he replied, not a chance you wait and see MONDAY, and they disappeared, and it was still way too early for them to just stop harassing people, but they never returned, we knew something was up, we knew he was going to try to kill somebody, we knew they were in high school but which high school, we only knew the county they were in.<br /><br />FIVE of us called the fbi that night and were insulted by them.<br />After the event, we learned some parents had previously made complaints about them that were also ignored. <br /><br />That Friday night the INSULT I GOT FULLY TOOK ALL MY RESPECT AWAY FROM THE fbi.....<br /><br />EVEN biden KNOWS WHAT THE fbi IS AND IS NOT.....",

A month later, Smith was arrested at a rowdy school board meeting where officials seemed to deny the existence of assaults in district bathrooms and locker rooms. He faced an obstruction of justice charge and a disorderly conduct charge.In May 2022, Smith and his attorney State Senator Bill Stanley (R-Franklin) announced that a court had dropped the obstruction charge. In May, Stanley also argued that Biberaj should be recused; Plowman’s September 2 order grants the recusal and appoints Stafford County Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric Olsen to take over the criminal case.Biberaj is disliked by Republicans for her progressive prosecutorial stance and her recusal is a win for those concerned more broadly about Democratic policy in Loudoun County. Olsen is a Republican with over a decade in the role; in 2019 he said the top issues in his district were gun violence, an increasingly complex criminal justice system, and a need to protect victims’ rights, according to Potomac Local News. This is the second time Plowman has recused Biberaj from a case, according to Loudoun Now.https://therepublicanstandard.com/featured/attorney-recused-in-loudoun-school-board-case/ericburk/2022/09/",
