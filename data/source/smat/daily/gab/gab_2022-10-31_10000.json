There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

          "content": "Elon Musk’s Twitter is planning to charge $20 PER MONTH for coveted blue check marks: New ‘Twitter Blue’ subscription feature is on track to be deployed next week – or else employees will be firedust days after taking over Twitter, Elon Musk issued an ultimatum to engineers over a new project.According to a report from The Verge, Musk wants to launch a pay-for-play verification system in which verified users are charged $20 per month. The kicker is that engineers have until November 7 to launch the scheme or face being fired. Employees were only told of the project on October 30. The Verge report says that the price of the verification is subject to change. The price will also cover so-far unspecified other features. Since Musk first offered to buy Twitter, the world’s wealthiest man has made it clear he planned to shake things up at the social media giant. Hours before The Verge report emerged, Musk tweeted: ‘The whole verification process is being revamped right now.’Earlier, tech website Platformer Casey Newton reported that Twitter was leaning towards asking for verified users to pay for the privilege.http://DailyMail.com has asked Twitter for comment on this story.There are close to 400,000 verified users on Twitter. Making them pay could help the platform stay afloat after reports that bots make up five percent of all users and ‘heavy tweeters’ make up less than 10 percent of the site’s monthly users.Less active users mean fewer eyeballs for advertisers.

Employees were only told of the project on October 30. <\/p><p>The Verge report says that the price of the verification is subject to change. The price will also cover so-far unspecified other features. <\/p><p>Since Musk first offered to buy Twitter, the world’s wealthiest man has made it clear he planned to shake things up at the social media giant. <\/p><p>Hours before The Verge report emerged, Musk tweeted: ‘The whole verification process is being revamped right now.’<\/p><p>Earlier, tech website Platformer Casey Newton reported that Twitter was leaning towards asking for verified users to pay for the privilege.<\/p><p><a href=\"http://DailyMail.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>DailyMail.com<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> has asked Twitter for comment on this story.<\/p><p>There are close to 400,000 verified users on Twitter. Making them pay could help the platform stay afloat after reports that bots make up five percent of all users and ‘heavy tweeters’ make up less than 10 percent of the site’s monthly users.<\/p><p>Less active users mean fewer eyeballs for advertisers.

He had picketed naked at protests against laws requiring people to be clothed in public.Protesting such a reasonable law is not usually an activity of a Trump supporter.Sign up for Newsmax’s Daily NewsletterReceive breaking news and original analysis - sent right to your inbox.Your Email AddressZip Code(Optional for Local News)Sign Me UpPrivacy: We never share your email address.Taub, the mother of DePape's three children, told the New York Post he has been suffering from mental illness.  \"He is mentally ill. He has been mentally ill for a long time,\" she told ABC 7.Taub, who currently is serving time in a California prison for abducting a teenage boy, said DePape had disappeared for over a year and then resurfaced recently.\"He thought he was Jesus,\" she told ABC 7.\"He was constantly paranoid, thinking people were after him. And it took a good year or two to get back to, you know, being halfway normal.\"She also noted DePape's politics were not right-wing.\"Well, when I met him, he was only 20 years old, and he didn't have any experience in politics. And he was very much in alignment with my views, and I've always been very progressive,\" she said. \"This was not a random act,\" San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said. \"This was intentional.

He had picketed naked at protests against laws requiring people to be clothed in public.<br /><br />Protesting such a reasonable law is not usually an activity of a Trump supporter.<br /><br /><br />Sign up for Newsmax’s Daily Newsletter<br />Receive breaking news and original analysis - sent right to your inbox.<br /><br />Your Email Address<br />Zip Code<br />(Optional for Local News)<br />Sign Me Up<br />Privacy: We never share your email address.<br />Taub, the mother of DePape's three children, told the New York Post he has been suffering from mental illness.  <br /><br />\"He is mentally ill. He has been mentally ill for a long time,\" she told ABC 7.<br /><br />Taub, who currently is serving time in a California prison for abducting a teenage boy, said DePape had disappeared for over a year and then resurfaced recently.<br /><br />\"He thought he was Jesus,\" she told ABC 7.<br /><br />\"He was constantly paranoid, thinking people were after him. And it took a good year or two to get back to, you know, being halfway normal.\"<br /><br />She also noted DePape's politics were not right-wing.<br /><br />\"Well, when I met him, he was only 20 years old, and he didn't have any experience in politics. And he was very much in alignment with my views, and I've always been very progressive,\" she said. <br /><br />\"This was not a random act,\" San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said. \"This was intentional.

Dehmlow rõhutas Twitteri ja JPMorgan Chase'i tippjuhid osalenud arutelu märkmete kohaselt, et \"me vajame meedia infrastruktuuri, mida peetakse vastutustundlikuks.\" \"Me ei kooskõlasta sisu modereerimise otsuste tegemisel teiste üksustega ja hindame sisu sõltumatult vastavalt Twitteri reeglitele,\" kirjutas Twitteri pressiesindaja avalduses The Interceptile. Samuti on olemas ametlik protsess, mille kohaselt saavad valitsusametnikud Facebookis või Instagramis sisu otse märgistada ja taotleda selle piiramist või mahasurumist spetsiaalse Facebooki portaali kaudu, mille kasutamiseks on vaja valitsuse või õiguskaitseorganite meili.

FBI keeldus kommentaaridest. DHS-i missioon võidelda desinformatsiooniga, mis tulenes murest Venemaa mõju pärast 2016. aasta presidendivalimistel, hakkas kujunema 2020. aasta valimiste ajal ja jõupingutustest kujundada arutelusid vaktsiinipoliitika üle koroonaviiruse pandeemia ajal.  The Intercepti erinevatest allikatest kogutud dokumendid, sealhulgas praegused ametnikud ja avalikult kättesaadavad aruanded, näitavad DHSi aktiivsemate meetmete arengut. Vastavalt DHSi nelja-aastase sisejulgeoleku ülevaate kavandile, mis on DHS-i peamiste aruannete aruanne, milles kirjeldatakse osakonna strateegiat ja prioriteete järgmistel aastatel, kavatseb osakond suunata \"ebatäpset teavet\" paljudel teemadel, sealhulgas \"COVID-i päritolu kohta\", pandeemia ja COVID-19 vaktsiinide tõhusus, rassiline õiglus, Afganistanist lahkumine ja USA Ukrainale antava toetuse olemus. \"Väljakutse on eriti terav marginaliseeritud kogukondades,\" öeldakse raportis, \"mis on sageli vale või eksitava teabe sihtmärgiks, näiteks valeteave hääletamisprotseduuride kohta, mis on suunatud värvilistele inimestele.\" USA 2021. aasta Afganistanist lahkumise kaasamine on eriti tähelepanuväärne, arvestades, et esindajatekoja vabariiklased on lubanud asja uurida.  \"See muudab Benghazi palju väiksema probleemina,\" ütles relvajõudude komitee liige, R-La esindaja Mike Johnson, lisades, et vastuste leidmine on esmatähtis. Seda, kuidas valitsus desinformatsiooni määratleb, ei ole selgelt sõnastatud ja desinformatsiooni olemuslikult subjektiivne olemus annab sisejulgeolekuministeeriumi ametnikele laialdase võimaluse teha poliitiliselt motiveeritud otsuseid selle kohta, mis on ohtlik kõne. Desinformatsiooni olemuslikult subjektiivne olemus annab sisejulgeolekuministeeriumi ametnikele ulatusliku võimaluse teha poliitiliselt motiveeritud otsuseid selle kohta, mis on ohtlik kõne.

          "contentraw": "The Intercepti uurimine leidis, et sisejulgeolekuosakond laiendab vaikselt oma jõupingutusi, et ohjeldada kõnet, mida ta peab ohtlikuks.  Aastatepikkused DHS-i sisesed memod, meilid ja dokumendid – mis on saadud lekete ja käimasoleva kohtuasja kaudu, samuti avalikud dokumendid – illustreerivad agentuuri ulatuslikke jõupingutusi tehnoloogiaplatvormide mõjutamiseks.<br /><br /> Töö, millest suur osa on Ameerika avalikkusele teadmata, sai selgema vaatepunkti selle aasta alguses, kui DHS kuulutas välja uue \"desinformatsiooni haldusnõukogu\": paneeli, mis on loodud desinformatsiooni  kontrollimiseks ja väärinformatsioon (tavaliselt kontekstiväliselt jagatav faktiline teave kahjulike kavatsustega), mis väidetavalt ohustab USA huve.  Kuigi juhatust laialdaselt naeruvääristati, see vähendati kohe ja suleti mõne kuu jooksul, on käimas ka muud algatused, kuna DHS pöörab tähelepanu sotsiaalmeedia jälgimisele nüüd, kui selle esialgne mandaat – terrorismivastane sõda – on lõpetatud.<br /><br /> USA valitsus on kinniste uste taga ja eraplatvormidele avaldatud surve tõttu kasutanud oma võimu, et püüda kujundada online-diskursust.  Missouri peaprokuröri, vabariiklasest Eric Schmitti, kes kandideerib ka senatisse, kohtumise protokollide ja muude dokumentide kohaselt on arutelud ulatunud valitsuse sekkumise ulatusest  veebidiskursusesse kuni eemaldamistaotluste sujuvamaks muutmise mehhanismini.<br /><br /> Võtmed kaasavõtmiseks<br /><br /> Kuigi DHS sulges oma vastuolulise desinformatsiooni haldusnõukogu, näitab strateegiline dokument, et selle aluseks olev töö käib.<br /><br /> DHS kavatseb sihtida ebatäpset teavet \"COVID-19 pandeemia päritolu ja COVID-19 vaktsiinide tõhususe, rassilise õigluse, USA lahkumise Afganistanist ja USA Ukrainale antava toetuse olemuse kohta\".<br /><br /> Facebook lõi DHS-ile ja valitsuspartneritele spetsiaalse portaali, et desinformatsioonist otse teatada.<br /><br /> \"Platvormid peavad saama valitsuse jaoks mugavaks.

Years of internal DHS memos, emails, and documents — obtained via leaks and an ongoing lawsuit, as well as public documents — illustrate an expansive effort by the agency to influence tech platforms.The work, much of which remains unknown to the American public, came into clearer view earlier this year when DHS announced a new “Disinformation Governance Board”: a panel designed to police misinformation (false information spread unintentionally), disinformation (false information spread intentionally), and malinformation (factual information shared, typically out of context, with harmful intent) that allegedly threatens U.S. interests. While the board was widely ridiculed, immediately scaled back, and then shut down within a few months, other initiatives are underway as DHS pivots to monitoring social media now that its original mandate — the war on terror — has been wound down.Behind closed doors, and through pressure on private platforms, the U.S. government has used its power to try to shape online discourse. According to meeting minutes and other records appended to a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican who is also running for Senate, discussions have ranged from the scale and scope of government intervention in online discourse to the mechanics of streamlining takedown requests for false or intentionally misleading information.“Platforms have got to get comfortable with gov’t.

Dehmlow, according to notes of the discussion attended by senior executives from Twitter and JPMorgan Chase, stressed that “we need a media infrastructure that is held accountable.”“We do not coordinate with other entities when making content moderation decisions, and we independently evaluate content in line with the Twitter Rules,” a spokesperson for Twitter wrote in a statement to The Intercept.There is also a formalized process for government officials to directly flag content on Facebook or Instagram and request that it be throttled or suppressed through a special Facebook portal that requires a government or law enforcement email to use.

The FBI declined to comment.DHS’s mission to fight disinformation, stemming from concerns around Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election, began taking shape during the 2020 election and over efforts to shape discussions around vaccine policy during the coronavirus pandemic. Documents collected by The Intercept from a variety of sources, including current officials and publicly available reports, reveal the evolution of more active measures by DHS.According to a draft copy of DHS’s Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, DHS’s capstone report outlining the department’s strategy and priorities in the coming years, the department plans to target “inaccurate information” on a wide range of topics, including “the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.”“The challenge is particularly acute in marginalized communities,” the report states, “which are often the targets of false or misleading information, such as false information on voting procedures targeting people of color.”The inclusion of the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is particularly noteworthy, given that House Republicans, should they take the majority in the midterms, have vowed to investigate. “This makes Benghazi look like a much smaller issue,” said Rep.

Their messaging turned, trying to make the attacker a right-wing activist who was looking to take down Nancy.Former Rep. Donna Edwards (D- MD) said on MSNBC’s “The Sunday Show” that the attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, Paul Pelosi was in part a result of the “Tea Party Movement.”“When you think back over the last decade or so, I look to the beginnings of the Tea Party movement when they were more active threats against members of Congress. That has escalated to the point we are now. It is so sad what is happened with Paul Pelosi in the Pelosi family. this is a very, very dangerous time. At the same time, you don’t want to scare people so much that you scare the motive voting.”In reality, the suspect David DePape has a sketchy, liberal past.“He is mentally ill. He has been mentally ill for a long time,” said Taub, who last year was found guilty on 20 counts, including the attempted abduction of a 14-year-old boy near his Berkeley high school.Taub told ABC7 News that she and DePape met more than 20 years ago. Together they raised their two sons and her daughter until about seven years ago.Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on this week’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday” that it is unfair to blame Republicans for the attack on Paul Pelosi.Anchor Shannon Bream said, “I want to start with the attack on Paul Pelosi, it is getting all the headlines this weekend. He is recovering from surgery, expected to do well, and have a full recovery. But The Washington Post wasted no time, writing this, ‘For many Democrats, the attack on Nancy Pelosi’s husband represents the all but enviable conclusion of Republicans increasingly violent and threatening rhetoric toward political opponents.’ There is still a lot we don’t about this case, what do you make much of that accusation?”McDaniel said, “Well, I think that’s unfair. I think this is a deranged individual. You can’t say people saying let’s fire Pelosi or let’s take back the House saying go do violence. It’s just unfair. And I think we all need to recognize violence is up across the board. Lee Zeldin was attacked. We had an assassination attempt against Brett Kavanaugh. And Democrats didn’t refute — didn’t repudiate that. Joe Biden didn’t talk about the assassination attempt against Brett Kavanaugh.”The story actually appears to have some leftist perverse sexual underpinnings to it, which blew up in their face.They are trying to spin it, making it a MAGA-attempted hit job.But, the New CEO of Twitter, Elon Musk originally fact-checked one of Hillary Clinton’s tweets for pushing a false narrative, but then subsequently deleted the post.The original link to the article referenced by Musk, was scrubbed from Google but here’s a quote from the archived version of the article:    As SF’s gay bars closed at 2 am, two gay men met in a bar and went home together.
