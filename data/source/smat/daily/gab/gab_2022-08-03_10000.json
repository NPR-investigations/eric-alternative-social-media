Any spiritual experience we’ve ever had can be explained scientifically, and religions don’t want you to go anywhere near this knowledge. Religion keeps us in a child state, we need to start operating as adults. We’re missing 90% of our lives because we’re only using 10% of our brain. The way is narrow, and few there be that find it. \n\nFrom the cosmology video I previously shared, there is a chart detailing the different angels mentioned in this video- Samael, Gabriel, Michael, etc. All archangels or arc angles of current that we observe in electricity, and how they operate within the heavens as stars and planets. An allegory (spiritual representation) of our physical experience. The stars have been given to us as signs and seasons, to orient ourselves in space and time. All ancient teachings give physical attributes (angels) to these invisible experiences to help us better comprehend these events.\n\nWe live in a fictional world which keeps us from engaging any part of our brains that would cause friction or resistance to our energy. As a result we experience stress and eventual burnout. Jesus said- “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me… and you shall have rest unto yourselves.” And the verse in Romans- “Do not be conformed by this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.” And Matthew- “ But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.”\n\nBy truly understanding our physical world, we better understand ourselves. All of our religious symbolism and traditions are co-opted from these scientific understandings.\n\nWatch the following video for a better understanding of these concepts:\n\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/video/sKyXTLkfs71p/'",

Sandy Hook School Shooting was planned in advance. I, Steven G. Erickson, knew about it in 2011, as well as the Boston Marathon Bombing, &amp; Las Vegas Shooting. <br /><br />I  did not know all of the details. <br /><br />My friend retired Hartford Narcotics Detective Rich Murzin, a founder of DHS &amp; reporter AJ Fontaine &amp; CT Private Investigators stole DHS CT State Police files for upcoming psy-ops. Officers were to be paid for operations. It was Obamas 2012 NDAA that funded them, paid to propagandize media/censor, turning the US over to UN, Central Bankers, &amp; China, suspending the US Constitution. <br /><br />Murzin &amp; Fontaine died of \"natural causes\" within hours of each other 2 weeks before we were to release a docu-series first live on CT Community Access Television, then YouTube, then mail order DVDs. <br /><br />Less than 3 hours after the News of Sandy Hook New Town Connecticut, I call BS on LiveLeak, YouTube, &amp; my Google Blogger blogs including The Stark Raving Viking. Sgt Paul Vance is the Connecticut State Police Spokesman &amp; went out live &amp; said right after the incident that anyone questioning the Connecticut State Police version of events would be arrested anywhere in the US if any of us spoke out. <br /><br />So, I called in to Vance, was recording the conversation, &amp; said I would like to have a conversation where I called BS on Sandy Hook &amp; would they please come &amp; arrest me as I would like to go through their Connecticut Kangaroo Court System &amp; levy my accusations even to their purposely tainted insider juries. <br /><br />I want to call out former CT Atty Gen Dick Blumenthal, a leader in the Int'l Banker Jewish Gay Mafia out on his complicity in 9-11 &amp; now the latest round of BS. Michael Chertoff, Israeli National &amp; Mossad, is an enforcer for UN, Central Bankers, Corporate Organized Crime, &amp; the Rothschild Opium &amp; 1000s of years old Slaver Cartel based in Chinese cave complexes. <br /><br />George H.W. Bush signed off on the COV-19 World ID (QR Code) Chinese One World Currency Vaccine Passport in Rio de Janeiro 1992 UN Agenda 21 for Event 201 (COVID) to be launched as 2 week drill by Fall of 2019 to put in NWO as Global Government Banking, &amp; 95% Population Reduction.  <br /><br />All is to my best belief &amp; knowledge.

Sandy Hook School Shooting was planned in advance. I, Steven G. Erickson, knew about it in 2011, as well as the Boston Marathon Bombing, &amp; Las Vegas Shooting. <br /><br />I  did not know all of the details. <br /><br />My friend retired Hartford Narcotics Detective Rich Murzin, a founder of DHS &amp; reporter AJ Fontaine &amp; CT Private Investigators stole DHS CT State Police files for upcoming psy-ops. Officers were to be paid for operations. It was Obamas 2012 NDAA that funded them, paid to propagandize media/censor, turning the US over to UN, Central Bankers, &amp; China, suspending the US Constitution. <br /><br />Murzin &amp; Fontaine died of \"natural causes\" within hours of each other 2 weeks before we were to release a docu-series first live on CT Community Access Television, then YouTube, then mail order DVDs. <br /><br />Less than 3 hours after the News of Sandy Hook New Town Connecticut, I call BS on LiveLeak, YouTube, &amp; my Google Blogger blogs including The Stark Raving Viking. Sgt Paul Vance is the Connecticut State Police Spokesman &amp; went out live &amp; said right after the incident that anyone questioning the Connecticut State Police version of events would be arrested anywhere in the US if any of us spoke out. <br /><br />So, I called in to Vance, was recording the conversation, &amp; said I would like to have a conversation where I called BS on Sandy Hook &amp; would they please come &amp; arrest me as I would like to go through their Connecticut Kangaroo Court System &amp; levy my accusations even to their purposely tainted insider juries. <br /><br />I want to call out former CT Atty Gen Dick Blumenthal, a leader in the Int'l Banker Jewish Gay Mafia out on his complicity in 9-11 &amp; now the latest round of BS. Michael Chertoff, Israeli National &amp; Mossad, is an enforcer for UN, Central Bankers, Corporate Organized Crime, &amp; the Rothschild Opium &amp; 1000s of years old Slaver Cartel based in Chinese cave complexes. <br /><br />George H.W. Bush signed off on the COV-19 World ID (QR Code) Chinese One World Currency Vaccine Passport in Rio de Janeiro 1992 UN Agenda 21 for Event 201 (COVID) to be launched as 2 week drill by Fall of 2019 to put in NWO as Global Government Banking, &amp; 95% Population Reduction.  <br /><br />All is to my best belief &amp; knowledge.

Sandy Hook School Shooting was planned in advance. I, Steven G. Erickson, knew about it in 2011, as well as the Boston Marathon Bombing, &amp; Las Vegas Shooting. <br /><br />I  did not know all of the details. <br /><br />My friend retired Hartford Narcotics Detective Rich Murzin, a founder of DHS &amp; reporter AJ Fontaine &amp; CT Private Investigators stole DHS CT State Police files for upcoming psy-ops. Officers were to be paid for operations. It was Obamas 2012 NDAA that funded them, paid to propagandize media/censor, turning the US over to UN, Central Bankers, &amp; China, suspending the US Constitution. <br /><br />Murzin &amp; Fontaine died of \"natural causes\" within hours of each other 2 weeks before we were to release a docu-series first live on CT Community Access Television, then YouTube, then mail order DVDs. <br /><br />Less than 3 hours after the News of Sandy Hook New Town Connecticut, I call BS on LiveLeak, YouTube, &amp; my Google Blogger blogs including The Stark Raving Viking. Sgt Paul Vance is the Connecticut State Police Spokesman &amp; went out live &amp; said right after the incident that anyone questioning the Connecticut State Police version of events would be arrested anywhere in the US if any of us spoke out. <br /><br />So, I called in to Vance, was recording the conversation, &amp; said I would like to have a conversation where I called BS on Sandy Hook &amp; would they please come &amp; arrest me as I would like to go through their Connecticut Kangaroo Court System &amp; levy my accusations even to their purposely tainted insider juries. <br /><br />I want to call out former CT Atty Gen Dick Blumenthal, a leader in the Int'l Banker Jewish Gay Mafia out on his complicity in 9-11 &amp; now the latest round of BS. Michael Chertoff, Israeli National &amp; Mossad, is an enforcer for UN, Central Bankers, Corporate Organized Crime, &amp; the Rothschild Opium &amp; 1000s of years old Slaver Cartel based in Chinese cave complexes. <br /><br />George H.W. Bush signed off on the COV-19 World ID (QR Code) Chinese One World Currency Vaccine Passport in Rio de Janeiro 1992 UN Agenda 21 for Event 201 (COVID) to be launched as 2 week drill by Fall of 2019 to put in NWO as Global Government Banking, &amp; 95% Population Reduction.  <br /><br />All is to my best belief &amp; knowledge.

You will feel a sense of bliss within your beings as you complete the release of these old energies. As you come closer and closer to that moment of Union, the bliss begins to take over.

Perhaps He was having a conversation with someone, not applying Himself fully to overcoming your ego resistance. But in the perfect moment, He focuses His energy and you are thrown to the floor. You are in surrender. And in that moment of surrender, you recognize the Oneness. All of your control issues become totally humorous. For you see you were trying to control and receive only certain aspects of God, when in effect you could have received with equanimity each experience that was presented to you and enjoyed it all.So, dear ones, practice your acceptance. Practice offering up all your experiences to the Higher Self, to God. Live from trust. Don't be afraid to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves to you.

Thank you Michigan!Congratulations to Blake Masters on a Great Arizona Win!David Farnsworth trounced RINO Rusty Bowers in Arizona SD 10, 64% to 36%. It was a race that they said couldn’t be won, but it was, easily. People didn’t believe Rusty Bowers when he testified in front of the Unselect Committee. Congratulations David, great job!Senators are meeting right now on reforming the Electoral Count Act so that a Vice President can no longer do what EVERYBODY, except for certain Conservative legal scholars, said was not allowed to be done. So they all lied. The V.P. could have sent fraudulent votes back to State Legislatures!Endorsements don’t get any more powerful or conclusive than the Endorsements of last night. I wonder if anyone will write or report that? Just asking?Ran the entire board!BIG, HISTORIC WINS for Trump-endorsed candidates across the Country last night! Now 15-0 in Senate primaries, Perfect Records in Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, and Missouri. Congratulations to our MAGA Candidates!わぉ！　ラスティ・バウアーズ議長がアリゾナで負けた。いいニュースだ！ジョン・ギブスはミシガンで弾劾者ピーター・メイジャーに対抗して優勢です。カンザス州とミズーリ州では、支持する全てのレースに勝利しました。 「エリック、すごいぞ、最高の夜だ。ありがとう！」ミシガンは素晴らしい夜でした！チューダー・ディクソンは、偉大な知事になる。ジョン・ギブスが、最後に大きくリードして勝利しました。弾劾者にとっては不利な状況です - 7人減って、あと3人です。ミシガン州に感謝します。ブレイク・マスターズ、アリゾナでの大勝利おめでとう。アリゾナ州第10選挙区で、デービッド・ファーンズワースがRINOのラスティ・バワーズを、64%対36%で惨敗させました。勝てないと言われていた選挙戦でしたが、あっさり勝ちました。アンセレクト委員会の前でラスティ・バワーズが証言したとき、人々は信じていませんでした。おめでとう、デビッド、よくやった今、上院議員たちが選挙人集計法の改正について会議をしています。ある保守的な法律学者を除いて、誰もが許されないと言ったことを、副大統領ができなくなるようにです。つまり、彼らは皆、嘘をついたのです。副大統領は不正な票を州議会に送り返すことができたのです！」昨夜の支持以上に強力で、決定的な支持は得られません。誰か報道記事にしないの？　聞くですか？役員全員を走らせろ！昨夜、全米のトランプ推薦候補に大きな、歴史的な勝利がもたらされました。上院予備選で15勝0敗、アリゾナ、カンザス、ミシガン、ミズーリでは完璧な記録です。MAGA（アメリカ再興）候補の皆さん、おめでとうございます！https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/14993https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/14994https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/14995https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/14996https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/14997https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/14998https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/14999https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/15000https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/15001https://t.me/real_DonaldJTrump/15002#WWG1WGA🦁👑💕🌈👍✨🌸🐰🌸#QArmyJapanFlynn #WWG1WGA #DigitalSoldider #DarktoRight @EriQmapJapan ←follow",
