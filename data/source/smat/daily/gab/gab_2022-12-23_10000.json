The bottom line is they realistically have no idea what they’re talking about. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of those types of “salvation by works” cults and false religions. On the other hand, Titus 3:9-11 is aimed directly at Judaism and contains instructions for those born again regarding those wrapped up in it.(Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). The Lord is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not The Lord.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots.

That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.(SIDE NOTE - The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you.

When the time arrived, Fossnock was there as promised, his 10-month-old twins tucked inside baby seats sitting in his shopping cart.But Julie never showed up. Christopher Abercrombie did.Armed with his camera phone, the 42-year-old Indianapolis resident confronted Fossnock over the texts he sent to “Julie,” a decoy created by Abercrombie.“A f— 15 year old, huh?” Fossnock said upon seeing Abercrombie. The age of consent in Indiana is 16.After initially denying who he was and why he was there, the Frankfort resident eventually admitted he had sent the texts. He wasn’t going to do anything sexual, he told Abercrombie; he just wanted to hang out because he was lonely.Five days later, after Abercrombie submitted the phone with the text exchanges to police, Fossnock was arrested on a warrant for child solicitation and dissemination of matter harmful to a minor. He eventually took a plea agreement in the case and was sentenced to three years of probation.It was Feb. 12, 2021, and Abercrombie had just helped land his first arrest as the founder of the Facebook group called Exposing Predators of Indiana’s Children (EPIC).“I mean, I got 62,000 people that follow me and support me, so it feels great,” Abercrombie said recently.CATCHING IN INDIANAThe incident in Frankfort was just one of thousands of sting operations conducted in the U.S. and around the globe by groups like EPIC, which have been popping up for years on social media sites.The formula is virtually always the same: Civilian catchers create decoy accounts on dating apps and then reveal to people who respond that they are an underage girl or boy.If the conversation continues, they lure men into conversations that eventually become sexual. The catchers then set up a place to meet, where they confront the person during a livestream so their thousands of fans can watch.Some call them heroes selflessly defending children. Others see them as untrained vigilantes who sensationalize what should be hard-nosed police work.That divide in opinion is growing ever deeper as Facebook catcher groups gain more followers by the day while more prosecutors have come out against the dangers and legal pitfalls baked into how they operate.But love them or hate them, catcher groups aren’t going away, and instead have become embedded in American’s criminal justice system.In just the past three years, at least 160 groups in the U.S. have been running predator catcher operations, according to a Washington Post analysis of their social media posts. One YouTube channel tracking catchers has counted more than 920 stings by amateurs this year alone, the analysis found.In Indiana, groups like EPIC and Predator Catcher Indianapolis, which have the largest followings in the state, started gaining traction in 2020, adding tens of thousands of followers as they traveled the state livestreaming their confrontations with men looking for sex from minors.One of the most recent videos to gain attention came Oct. 22 from the Predator Catcher Muncie Facebook group, who approached a former teacher at an Applebee’s after texting with him as a decoy 14-year-old boy.The 63-year-old previously taught in Logansport schools for 39 years before retiring in 2020 and taking a job as a teacher’s aide at West View Elementary School in Muncie. In the video, he admitted to texting the decoy and confessed to the group that “this might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever done.”But unlike the Frankfort arrest, no charges have been filed against the former teacher.That’s because after years of dealing with vigilante catcher groups, Delaware County Prosecutor Eric Hoffman is fed up with their tactics and refuses to take their cases.‘I CANNOT CONDONE CATCHERS’In the parking lot of a Planet Fitness in Ohio in 2017, a catcher approached a man who had been corresponding with a fabricated 14-year-old-girl.",

I was then surprised by their admission, as I fully expected their propaganda machine to continue ad nauseum with the lies, to distribute numerous external photos of closed magazines claiming that they were full of WMDs (but were actually empty). Ultimately, however, there comes a time when full-blown lies must be unleashed, especially when all U.S. personnel in Iraq could never, ever verify any find of WMDs, writes Eric Arthur Blair .So it turned out that the testimonies of experts such as Hans Blix, Scott Ritter (UN weapons inspectors) and Andrew Wilkie (Australian military intelligence officer) that no significant WMDs existed in Iraq at the time were 100% justified. The US Deep State 1(and his satraps) spared no effort to discredit, punish and even kill those who dared to contradict the American “WMDs in Iraq” fabrications. Andrew Wilkie was removed from his position. They taunted and bullied Hans Blix endlessly, leading Blix de Anglo to call the WMD liars “those bastards” who used “bad faith” to start a “witch hunt.” Scott Ritter was character assassinated, tried and convicted of unrelated matters in what was clearly a trap 2 .

The bogus Blair named good-ole-boy Hutton the head of a phony “investigation” that dutifully labeled Kelly's death a suicide and exonerated his buddy Blair and the English authorities. 3In the US, the psychopath in charge (the flaccid dick Cheney, not the limp, crab-infected Bush) turned viciously against even Republican loyalists and long-lost CIA operatives.

However, Cheney persisted in spreading that lie to the public, which Wilson then openly disputed.

It is in the interests of the US Deep State to impose a general amnesia on the global public regarding the war crimes they have committed in Iraq (as well as in Afghanistan, Vietnam and Korea, not to mention the more than 50 despicable “interventions” abroad, from Iran in 1953 to Guatemala in 1954 and one of the most egregious – Chile in 1973).
