          "content": "Feds swing between pushing boosters, fueling vax hesitancy with Pfizer stroke inquiryCDC surveillance system finds possible \"safety concern for ischemic stroke\" in elderly people who got Pfizer's bivalent booster. Mainstream media turn on government narratives on bivalent effectiveness, official COVID statistics.Less than two days after FDA Commissioner Robert Califf credited bivalent COVID-19 boosters with \"significant\" and \"clinically meaningful\" reductions in hospitalization and death \"in all populations examined,\" his own agency gave a new boost to vaccine hesitancy.The CDC and FDA announced an \"additional investigation\"&nbsp;Friday afternoon into a possible \"safety concern for ischemic stroke\" in recipients of Pfizer's bivalent who are 65 and older, even while stating twice in bold that \"no change\" was recommended \"in vaccination practice.\"They said the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink provoked their \"rapid-response investigation,\" which \"raised a question\" about whether stroke was more likely within 21 days of boosting versus 22-44 days.The decision recalls the agencies' recommended \"pause\" in Johnson &amp; Johnson's traditional COVID vaccine in April 2021 following six dangerous blood clots in women.While the VSD signal is \"very unlikely\" to represent a \"true clinical risk,\" the agencies said they notified the public in the interest of transparency.Their prior failure to share bivalent data is partially responsible for an unexpected wave of skeptical media coverage this month, which has questioned the effectiveness of boosters that now-outdated Omicron subvariants as well as the reliability of official statistics on COVID.Several outside vaccine advisers, including the editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, told CNN Wednesday the agencies hid unfavorable results from them when they were considering whether to recommend Moderna's bivalent booster for approval.The U.S. is drastically overcounting COVID deaths and hospitalizations by conflating incidental infections with those that played a meaningful role, former Baltimore public health commissioner Leana Wen wrote in The Washington Post Friday.Tufts Medical Center epidemiologist Shira Doron told Wen that hospitalizations due to COVID \"were as low as 10 percent of the total number reported\" on some days, while attending physician Robin Dretler at Emory Decatur Hospital estimated 90% of those hospitalized with COVID are there \"for some other illness.\"The coverage gives new visibility to long-running scrutiny from some scientists, media and lawmakers. While the FDA's authorization of bivalents based on eight mice raised eyebrows last summer — before independent human studies found no improvement from bivalents — the concern about official statistics goes back more than two years.&nbsp;White House COVID adviser Anthony Fauci admitted PCR tests can pick up dead virus in July 2020. The next month, The New York Times exposed widespread overcounts of positives based on dead or insignificant viral loads. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky admitted in December 2021 that PCR tests can show positives for three months after infections clear.&nbsp;Several states told Just the News in January 2021 they were counting any hospitalization with a positive test as COVID-related.&nbsp;Oregon lawmakers are seeking a federal grand jury to investigate pandemic measurement decisions. The CDC's COVID death figures are \"inaccurate\" because they conflate primary, contributing and incidental causes, Great Barrington Declaration coauthors Martin Kulldorff and Jay Bhattacharya said in regulatory comments last spring.The early Moderna data, withheld from the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee and CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, showed infections were higher in the Wuhan-Omicron group than those who received the original Wuhan-only boosters.&nbsp;VRBPAC member Paul Offit, one of two \"no\" votes, told CNN he was \"angry\" with the FDA and Moderna for withholding data \"relevant to our decision.\" His colleague Eric Rubin, the NEJM editor-in-chief and \"yes\" voter, accused the agency of treating them like \"children.\"&nbsp;The FDA said it didn't have enough time to \"substantively review\" the data, which arrived the day before the VRBPAC meeting, before sharing it.Any data \"looked at as part of the study\" should be given to advisers as well, ACIP member Pablo Sanchez said.

          "content": "#GarageGate #BidenDocs #ClassifiedDocuments #SpecialCounsel #DOJShould Someone This Dumb Be the Special Counsel Investigating Biden's Stolen Classified Documents Scandal?We’re assured that the person hired to be special counsel in the Joe Biden classified document scandal, Robert Hur, “has a great record. He is a superb lawyer.” He was a pivotal right-hand man in a high governmental office. He “has a long and distinguished career as a federal prosecutor.” And was a key person dealing with a very special, special counsel.That guy sounds like a total legal dreamboat. Except that those accolades were spoken by none other than disgraced former-deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who conspired with the fellow disgracee Andrew McCabe to wear a wire to catch Donald Trump in a 25th Amendment-worthy meltdown because they hated him so much.Pardon me if I don’t swoon.The high government official was at the right hand of the awful FBI Director Chris Wray, who has overseen the complete transmogrification of the bureau from a law enforcement agency to an intelligence entity that spies on Americans. And the man touting his “distinguished career” is none other than the most ideologically Leftist hack who’s ever disgraced the office of the attorney general, Merrick Garland. And that’s saying something. Looking at you, “wingman” Eric Holder.And there’s more. Robert Hur is the man who served as the DOJ point man to Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation looking into Donald Trump’s alleged side hustle as a Russian secret agent — Double 45.He is the same guy who vetted retired British spy Christopher Steele, a disgraced (sensing a pattern here?) spy who was fired by the FBI (and then used on the QT by his cutout Bruce Ohr) and hired actual Russian spies on behalf of Hillary Clinton’s campaign to make up information on Trump.Jason Foster, former chief investigative counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee working for then-chairman Chuck Grassley, says Robert Hur was one of the officials “who handled, participated in, or ha[d] personal knowledge of the FBI’s relationship and communications with” dossier author Christopher Steele.[emphasis added]”Oh.Foster shared a document that shows Hur was a key man who dealt with Steele’s disinformation and got a FISA warrant to spy on Trump World using faked information that had been conjured up by the Hillary Clinton campaign.He was Rosenstein’s lawyer during the Russiagate probe and used his office to block the so-called Nunes memo that described the corrupt law enforcement and Democrat campaign against Trump, according to a guy who should know, Kash Patel, Nunes’s top investigator. Patel says Hur should be the first subpoena issued by Jim Jordan’s committee, which will look into government corruption.How dumb do you have to be to take the pee tape whopper at face value without supporting evidence? And then support that information for a warrant to spy on a private citizen, Trump’s campaign, and presidency? And then do nothing as that lie was repeated multiple times when he knew it was false. Unless he’s that dumb.This dumbness shouldn’t be a resume enhancer; it’s a reason to drum this guy out of polite society with the rest of the scoundrels who deserve to be sued into oblivion and locked in the Washington, D.C. gulag.You could take that resume and maybe talk a store clerk into giving you a dozen eggs or a barista to spot you a cup of cocoa, but we know all too well what a sham all of this was and the governmental players involved knew it too.An alternative explanation is that they’re too damn dumb to have picked up on the scam early and stop a miscarriage of justice. Or there’s a third option: They hated Trump so much and used every weapon in their arsenal to get rid of him, the truth be damned. We’ll take what’s behind Option Three.Hey, Joe, bring me those documents–I’ve got the gas stove fire working.Let’s go over to the Washington Examiner, where the estimable Jerry Dunleavy explains Hur’s other connections.Hur was appointed by former President Donald Trump to be the U.S. attorney for Maryland in 2017 and was confirmed in 2018. Maryland’s two Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, welcomed Trump’s selection.Hur held that position until his resignation in early February 2021, following Biden asking nearly all of the Trump-appointed federal prosecutors to step down.Garland had selected U.S. Attorney John Lausch, a Trump-appointed holdover, to handle the Justice Department’s investigation into Biden improperly keeping classified documents. Lausch, who flanked Garland during his Thursday announcement, is one of only two Trump-appointed federal prosecutors kept on by Biden — the other is David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, who is investigating Biden’s son Hunter.MORE @ https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/victoria-taft/2023/01/12/should-someone-this-dumb-to-be-the-special-counsel-investigating-joe-bidens-stolen-classified-documents-scandal-n1661310",
