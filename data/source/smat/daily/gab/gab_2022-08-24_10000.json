The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

Well just now Eric Dubay dropped an extremely interesting video which appears to provide a possible answer and explanation this question. See also the VM linked below in which I discuss this and other reality phenomena at length. The ionization of atmospheric gas aspect of this lines up with everything I've researched as well. Why is the sky blue? Most likely because of the presence of argon among other gasses within our enclosed system.

I hope a discourse with you on this platform may remedy that situation. In your video \"Worlds Most Powerful Structured Water Device\" you failed to divulge which end of your massive Nd-Fe-Bo magnet was the North-Seeking-Pole. I suspect since the water travelled anti-clockwise at the top of the magnet, it was the North-Seeking-Pole (South) since it's 'field' (torus of influence) is also anti-clockwise. In such a configuration the water would exit at the base in the direction of the 'field' (torus of influence) at the South-Seeking-Pole (North). Am I correct in my analysis? Does the paramagnetism of the Copper tubing have any effect worth considering?  I intend to build such a device &amp; being a student of the writings of Nikola Tesla, Viktor Schauberger, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, James Clark Maxwell, Faraday, both Thomsons, Eric Dollard et al for &gt;30 years, I feel I can build such a device.

The warrant also reveals an FBI investigation into the potential unlawful retention of the records as well as obstruction of justice.The figures on documents were included in a May 10 letter in which acting archivist Debra Steidel Wall told a lawyer for Trump, Evan Corcoran, that the Biden administration would not be honoring the former president’s claims of executive privilege over the documents.Corcoran had weeks earlier requested additional time to review the materials in the boxes before the Archives turned them over to the FBI so that he could to determine if some were subject to executive privilege and therefore exempt from disclosure, according to the letter.The letter was made public Tuesday on the website of the National Archives and Records Administration. It was earlier released Monday night on a website launched by John Solomon, who was appointed by Trump in June to be one of his designated representatives to the Archives and who is a Trump ally and conservative journalist.",

Dieses große Land schimmert durch seine Macht, seine Freiheit und seine Reichtümer über ganz Europa, ja über die ganze Erde hin als eine bewunderte Erscheinung; aber wahrlich, es steht drinnen nicht so glücklich, als sein Glanz nach außen fällt. Fast alle kleine und mittelmäßige Landbesitzer (die Yeomanry) sind verschwunden, und die Großen und Reichen besitzen das Land, und ihre Pächter bebauen es. Auch offenbart sich hier, welche Folge die zu große Ungleichheit des Vermögens, besonders insofern sie die kleinen Besitzer verschlingt, und ein die Welt umfassendes Fabrikwesen hat. Wie viele Strecken Land in England, worauf glückliche Bauern wohnen und wovon Weizenernten in die Scheunen gebracht werden könnten, hat die durch kein Gesetz eingeschränkte Laune der Reichen in Wildbahnen und Parks verwandelt! Welch eine Überschwemmung von Bettlern aus dieser Verdrängung der geringen Leute vom Grundbesitz, aus diesem mächtigen Fabrikwesen! Jetzt trägt sich dies alles, weil England über den Handel und über die Schätze der Welt gebietet; aber Weltumwälzungen und vorzüglich Handelsumwälzungen können kommen – und sie sind vielleicht nicht so fern, als manche glauben -, wodurch die Engländer mehr auf sich selbst zurückgeworfen und zurückgewiesen werden – dann werden sie in ihrer ganzen Häßlichkeit die Verwirrung und Regellosigkeit der Verhältnisse und die Furchtbarkeit des Übels sehen, das sie jetzt verkleistern und versalben, aber nicht heilen können.“ (Ernst Moritz Arndt, „Ein Wort über die Pflege und Erhaltung der Forsten und der Bauern im Sinne einer höheren, das heißt menschlichen Gesetzgebung“)\n",

The chemicals are absorbed by the insects and go to work destroying their nervous systems or circulatory systems. Before long, millions of insects experience a “died suddenly” event.When globalists want to kill off masses of humans living in high population density cities, they can similarly carpet bomb the city with aerosolized “vaccines” that are designed to be inhaled. These can be sprayed from low altitude aircraft in exactly the same way malathion was sprayed on populations, presumably to control mosquitoes and the over-hyped Zika virus.A recent article from Eugyppius: A Plague Chronicle reveals that Bill Gates-associated researchers are now pushing for covid nasal vaccines that could theoretically be sprayed on populations and inhaled without individual knowledge or consent.“Virus moron Eric Topol and snakeoil saleswoman Akiko Iwasaki plug mRNA nasal spray hocus pocus, demand a second Operation Warp Speed to further tinker with billions of human immune systems,” writes the website:Oligarchic support for nasal spray vaccines proceeds primarily from the beleaguered mind of Bill Gates, who is quietly disappointed in the performance of the mRNA elixirs and now places the better part of his hope in masking…Topol is just a mentally vacant Corona brigadier, but Iwasaki is co-founder of the pharmaceutical startup RIGImmune, which has received two million dollars from the Gates Foundation “to develop novel innate immune activators to protect against infectious diseases that disproportionately impact the developing world.” She’s also co-founded Xanadu Bio, which is trying to come up with nanoparticles that won’t kill you when you inhale them…If this effort succeeds, it would give globalists a way to air drop mRNA instructions on entire populations in exactly the same way farmers spray fields with insecticides. The mRNA instructions hijack the body’s cells, programming them to construct non-human protein structures which can also function as biological weapons that cause infertility or clots.As Natural News has exclusively documented with laboratory tests, these clots are self-assembling biostructures that grow in size until they block blood flow and often kill the victim. People are dropping dead just like weevils, and the “human herd” is being culled like never before.Human populations are seen as “plagues” by the globalists- - - - -Talk about violations of Nuremberg… this would effectively turn every targeted city into a Holocaust-style gas chamber where people breathe in the bioweapons that will kill them over time.Mary Holland of Children’s Health Defense is calling for global prosecutions against those who are perpetrating these crimes against humanity.Read morehttps://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-23-aerosolized-vaccines-sprayed-on-human-cities-for-global-depopulation.html",

These can be sprayed from low altitude aircraft in exactly the same way malathion was sprayed on populations, presumably to control mosquitoes and the over-hyped Zika virus.<br /><br />A recent article from Eugyppius: A Plague Chronicle reveals that Bill Gates-associated researchers are now pushing for covid nasal vaccines that could theoretically be sprayed on populations and inhaled without individual knowledge or consent.<br /><br />“Virus moron Eric Topol and snakeoil saleswoman Akiko Iwasaki plug mRNA nasal spray hocus pocus, demand a second Operation Warp Speed to further tinker with billions of human immune systems,” writes the website:<br /><br />Oligarchic support for nasal spray vaccines proceeds primarily from the beleaguered mind of Bill Gates, who is quietly disappointed in the performance of the mRNA elixirs and now places the better part of his hope in masking…<br /><br />Topol is just a mentally vacant Corona brigadier, but Iwasaki is co-founder of the pharmaceutical startup RIGImmune, which has received two million dollars from the Gates Foundation “to develop novel innate immune activators to protect against infectious diseases that disproportionately impact the developing world.” She’s also co-founded Xanadu Bio, which is trying to come up with nanoparticles that won’t kill you when you inhale them…<br /><br />If this effort succeeds, it would give globalists a way to air drop mRNA instructions on entire populations in exactly the same way farmers spray fields with insecticides. The mRNA instructions hijack the body’s cells, programming them to construct non-human protein structures which can also function as biological weapons that cause infertility or clots.<br /><br />As Natural News has exclusively documented with laboratory tests, these clots are self-assembling biostructures that grow in size until they block blood flow and often kill the victim. People are dropping dead just like weevils, and the “human herd” is being culled like never before.<br />Human populations are seen as “plagues” by the globalists<br />- - - - -<br />Talk about violations of Nuremberg… this would effectively turn every targeted city into a Holocaust-style gas chamber where people breathe in the bioweapons that will kill them over time.<br />Mary Holland of Children’s Health Defense is calling for global prosecutions against those who are perpetrating these crimes against humanity.<br /><br />Read more<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-23-aerosolized-vaccines-sprayed-on-human-cities-for-global-depopulation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>naturalnews.com/2022-08-23-aerosolized-vaccin<span class=\"invisible\">es-sprayed-on-human-cities-for-global-depopulation.html<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
