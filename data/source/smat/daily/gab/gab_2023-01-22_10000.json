Its first occupants will move from another relief center at a hotel, which will switch to accommodating asylum-seeking families with children.“Our city is at its breaking point,” said Adams, a Democrat who has repeatedly pleaded for state and federal assistance to address the flow of asylum-seekers — some of them bused by out-of-state governors — to the nation's most populous city. Adams traveled this week to El Paso, Texas, to visit the southern US border and press the point. He declared a state of emergency over the issue this fall.Altogether, 41k asylum-seekers have come to the city since last spring, according to the mayor. With the terminal, the city will have five such “Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief” centers for the nearly 28k asylum-seekers it is currently housing and those who may yet arrive. Some 77 hotels also have been tapped as emergency shelters.   [cont.]  ---------- NYT:  The relief center will serve some 1000 single, adult men, Mayor Eric Adams said, a similar capacity to a tent facility that the city had placed on Randalls Island until it shut down last fall after operating for just a month.The new center will also have a short shelf life: Mr. Adams said it will close ahead of cruise season this spring.“With more than 41k asylum seekers arriving in New York City since last spring and nearly 28k asylum seekers currently in our care, our city is at its breaking point,” the mayor told reporters on Saturday.He added: “We continue to surpass both our moral and legal obligations and meet the needs of people arriving in New York, but as the number of asylum seekers continues to grow, we are in serious need of support from both our state and federal governments.”The first occupants will be relocated from the Watson Hotel in Midtown Manhattan; the cruise terminal will also house newly arriving adult men as space allows. The Watson Hotel will then be used to serve families with children who are seeking asylum.The announcement was criticized by advocacy groups, particularly for the choice of location: far from the subway, close to wintry waterfront winds and in a high-risk flood zone, according to the city’s maps.The emergency center “will needlessly expose future residents to the elements during some of the coldest months of the year,” the Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the Homeless said in a joint statement. The city last year had proposed the first location for an emergency center on Orchard Beach in the Bronx, but it halted construction and abandoned the idea when the site flooded during a rainstorm.“Hotels have always been the better short-term option, in contrast to erecting tents in inaccessible parts of New York City that are prone to flooding,” the groups added. “Continuing to move asylum seekers around the boroughs like chess pieces is callous and indicative of City Hall’s failure to competently manage this crisis.”[cont.]  #NYC #NYT #alien #invasion #USA",

Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L.

It’s cults which add to Calvary, not GOD THE FATHER.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with GOD THE FATHER).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, GOD THE FATHER changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. A person ultimately only affects him or herself and forever’s a long time. We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law.Will cheerfully do what GOD THE FATHER says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with GOD THE FATHER happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in GOD THE FATHER than it is to put confidence in man.(SIDE NOTE - The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you. It’s more accurate and allowing Him to live in you is more feasible than merely trying to imitate behavior(s).As an FYI, in Judaism, they flat-out deny Jesus as The Messiah, and those in that Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of Judaism) would misinterpret John 14:21, John 14:23, and 1 John 2:3-4 (all regarding Biblical New Covenant commandments) by mixing in John 14:15 and saying, “If you love Me, keep the Torah, thereby earning your salvation.” The reality is that if you love Me (Jesus), keep JESUS’ commands...ONLY. Those are to believe in Him (John 5:24, John 6:29) and to live in love, ESPECIALLY for each other (John 13:34-35, John 15:5, 9-12).It’s unfortunate but one many miss is in Matthew 22:36-40: “Teacher, what is the greatest commandment IN THE LAW?” Some Pharisees were trying to trap Jesus and brought lawyers to help but they all failed…BADLY.JOHN 6:29 (RSV)Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God the Father, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”https://www.biblegateway.com/Somebody attempting to blend the Torah and the finished work of Christ is basically wasting your time. They do not blend. By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”).Simply rejecting Jesus (Judaism) or trying to blend Mosaic Law and Calvary (a Hebrew Roots Movement mindset—an offshoot of Judaism, in other words) are in themselves causing people to sin despite trying to do something about a sin problem. Judaism is a cursed false religion. HRM, like Roman Catholicism, is both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking - “Heresy”, in other words. Jesus did 100% of everything salvation-wise (Mark 1:15, John 14:6, John 19:30). By comparison, a human does 100% of nothing (John 15:5).",

Those are to believe in Him (John 5:24, John 6:29) and to live in love, ESPECIALLY for each other (John 13:34-35, John 15:5, 9-12).<br />It’s unfortunate but one many miss is in Matthew 22:36-40: “Teacher, what is the greatest commandment IN THE LAW?” Some Pharisees were trying to trap Jesus and brought lawyers to help but they all failed…BADLY.<br />JOHN 6:29 (RSV)<br />Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God the Father, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”<br /><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>biblegateway.com/<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Somebody attempting to blend the Torah and the finished work of Christ is basically wasting your time. They do not blend. By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”).<br /><br />Simply rejecting Jesus (Judaism) or trying to blend Mosaic Law and Calvary (a Hebrew Roots Movement mindset—an offshoot of Judaism, in other words) are in themselves causing people to sin despite trying to do something about a sin problem. Judaism is a cursed false religion. HRM, like Roman Catholicism, is both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking - “Heresy”, in other words. Jesus did 100% of everything salvation-wise (Mark 1:15, John 14:6, John 19:30). By comparison, a human does 100% of nothing (John 15:5).",
