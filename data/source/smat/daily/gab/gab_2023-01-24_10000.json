It costs many millions to run, but is described as “non-profit”<br />ERIC added a record 20million to voter rolls 2020 (vs 5m 2012)…<br /><br />…&amp; by contrast, it has failed to clean up the rolls, it’s main and original mission.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/01/good-news-alabama-secretary-state-officially-announces-states-withdrawal-failed-corrupt-eric-voter-roll-system/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2023/01/good-news-alabam<span class=\"invisible\">a-secretary-state-officially-announces-states-withdrawal-failed-corrupt-eric-voter-roll-system/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Well, that simple - it removes evil problem children from the world, puts an to the gene pool and it works if administared correctly via the consensus of the god fathers or special ops coordinator. I'll just say there are many in relatively high positions both private and govenment who need for this antidote to be applied, some while serving and others before they ever have a chance to run or take a position. If you have a brain, it's all so very clear and you'll figure it out for yourselves. If you haven't the mental capacity and can't, well, enjoy your Socialist Amerizuela and all the pain it has to bring. I have zero sympathy for your dumbasses.  - Download this clip to your own desktop and use it as you wish to make a point. It seems some of the tech companies and their affiliates are doing their best to see supreme justice is eardicated. They cannot afford for such a \"fix\" to become socially acceptable or be employed in protection of their icons. Does anyone remember the AT&amp;T slogan -\" reach out and touch someone\".",

He did make arrangements for his beloved Jack Russell and even left funds for the care &amp; maintenance of the dog.  I would find it far more unusual if she had left something to her ex-husband.",

          "content": "Deep StateNewsUSAWhite House Chief of Staff Ron Klain ArrestedBy Michael Baxter -January 22, 20237144531White Hats on Saturday arrested White House chief of Staff Ron Klain shortly after he announced he’d be leaving the illegitimate administration in a few weeks for personal reasons, a source in Gen. Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.Klain, a high-value target, had worked under globalists Al Gore and Barack Hussein Obama before joining the Biden campaign in late 2019. Throughout 2020, he worked as a senior advisor to Biden’s presidential campaign and was given the chief of staff position after Biden had successfully stolen the 2020 election.White Hats assert that Klain was a crucial player in masterminding the 2020 steal. They say Klain in early 2020 told Biden he had a foolproof plan to defeat President Trump even if Trump captured many electoral votes early on election night.

          "contentraw": "Deep StateNewsUSA<br />White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain Arrested<br />By Michael Baxter -January 22, 20237144531<br /><br />White Hats on Saturday arrested White House chief of Staff Ron Klain shortly after he announced he’d be leaving the illegitimate administration in a few weeks for personal reasons, a source in Gen. Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.<br /><br />Klain, a high-value target, had worked under globalists Al Gore and Barack Hussein Obama before joining the Biden campaign in late 2019. Throughout 2020, he worked as a senior advisor to Biden’s presidential campaign and was given the chief of staff position after Biden had successfully stolen the 2020 election.<br /><br />White Hats assert that Klain was a crucial player in masterminding the 2020 steal. They say Klain in early 2020 told Biden he had a foolproof plan to defeat President Trump even if Trump captured many electoral votes early on election night.

Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision which falsely held that abortion was a constitutional right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Abortion has not been banned in New York, so it’s not clear what the point of this even is other than to signal that New York stands with baby murder.This is really a circus show, to have this city run by Jews with this dancing monkey mayor who just says “yessa massa” whenever the Jews say “jump.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------“Historically, women’s health has not been prioritized,” the Democrat mayor said and claimed that the overturning of Roe had “endangered women’s health across the nation.” While the city already provides medical abortions at its eleven public hospitals, Adams noted, nevertheless “we are expanding the program to reach more New Yorkers,” he said.“No other city in the nation, or in the world, has a public health department that has provided medication abortion,”Adams boasted. “We are the first.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------It’s just grotesque.We’re talking about dead babies here.--------------------------------------------------------------------------“For too long, health and health care has been centered around men… If men had periods, pap smears, and menopause, they would get a paid vacation. And if men could get pregnant, we wouldn’t see Congress trying to pass laws restricting abortion,” the mayor claimed.Ashwin Vasan, the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene commissioner, said that the abortion pills will not only be free at the point of use, but will be “open to anyone,” a statement which introduces the question of a lower age limit on the procurement of the dangerous drugs.On January 3, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relaxed its guidelines on access to the abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol, allowing the drugs to be purchased over-the-counter in retail pharmacies, provided those pharmacies “complete a Pharmacy Agreement Form.”Although the drug still requires a prescription, medical professionals need only to become certified through the “modified” REMS program to prescribe, a qualification that has been simplified. According to government data collected by the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute, between 2002 and 2015 hospital visits following use of the abortion pill increased over 500 percent, compared with a 315 percent rise in visits following surgical abortion.Last November, a coalition of pro-life doctors and medical groups filed a lawsuit challenging the FDA’s approval of the two-drug chemical abortion regimen, citing the dangerous risks present for both mothers and their unborn babies.In the year 2000 the FDA categorized pregnancy as an “illness” for which abortion pills could then be considered a remedy, leading to the initial approval of their use.“Pregnancy is not an illness, and chemical abortion drugs don’t provide a therapeutic benefit,” the doctors’ lawyers argued.“They end a baby’s life, and they pose serious and life-threatening complications to the mother.”“The FDA never had the authority to approve these dangerous drugs for sale. We urge the court to listen to the doctors we represent who are seeking to protect girls and women from the documented dangers of chemical abortion drugs,” they added.--------------------------------------------------------------------------The abortion rate for white women is headed towards 100%.It’s a total horror show.These sluts get abortions, and then to justify it, they go out and support abortion fanatically.

Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision which falsely held that abortion was a constitutional right.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Abortion has not been banned in New York, so it’s not clear what the point of this even is other than to signal that New York stands with baby murder.<br /><br />This is really a circus show, to have this city run by Jews with this dancing monkey mayor who just says “yessa massa” whenever the Jews say “jump.”<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />“Historically, women’s health has not been prioritized,” the Democrat mayor said and claimed that the overturning of Roe had “endangered women’s health across the nation.” <br /><br />While the city already provides medical abortions at its eleven public hospitals, Adams noted, nevertheless “we are expanding the program to reach more New Yorkers,” he said.<br /><br />“No other city in the nation, or in the world, has a public health department that has provided medication abortion,”Adams boasted. “We are the first.”<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />It’s just grotesque.<br /><br />We’re talking about dead babies here.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />“For too long, health and health care has been centered around men… If men had periods, pap smears, and menopause, they would get a paid vacation. And if men could get pregnant, we wouldn’t see Congress trying to pass laws restricting abortion,” the mayor claimed.<br /><br />Ashwin Vasan, the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene commissioner, said that the abortion pills will not only be free at the point of use, but will be “open to anyone,” a statement which introduces the question of a lower age limit on the procurement of the dangerous drugs.<br /><br />On January 3, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relaxed its guidelines on access to the abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol, allowing the drugs to be purchased over-the-counter in retail pharmacies, provided those pharmacies “complete a Pharmacy Agreement Form.”<br /><br />Although the drug still requires a prescription, medical professionals need only to become certified through the “modified” REMS program to prescribe, a qualification that has been simplified. <br /><br />According to government data collected by the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute, between 2002 and 2015 hospital visits following use of the abortion pill increased over 500 percent, compared with a 315 percent rise in visits following surgical abortion.<br /><br />Last November, a coalition of pro-life doctors and medical groups filed a lawsuit challenging the FDA’s approval of the two-drug chemical abortion regimen, citing the dangerous risks present for both mothers and their unborn babies.<br /><br />In the year 2000 the FDA categorized pregnancy as an “illness” for which abortion pills could then be considered a remedy, leading to the initial approval of their use.<br /><br />“Pregnancy is not an illness, and chemical abortion drugs don’t provide a therapeutic benefit,” the doctors’ lawyers argued.“They end a baby’s life, and they pose serious and life-threatening complications to the mother.”<br /><br />“The FDA never had the authority to approve these dangerous drugs for sale. We urge the court to listen to the doctors we represent who are seeking to protect girls and women from the documented dangers of chemical abortion drugs,” they added.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The abortion rate for white women is headed towards 100%.<br /><br />It’s a total horror show.<br /><br />These sluts get abortions, and then to justify it, they go out and support abortion fanatically. <br /><br />If someone tells them it is wrong, it means they were wrong to do it, and a woman cannot grapple with the idea that it is possible for her to do something wrong.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://dailystormer.in/new-york-city-starts-giving-away-free-abortion-pills-to-anyone/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>dailystormer.in/new-york-city-starts-giving-a<span class=\"invisible\">way-free-abortion-pills-to-anyone/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
