We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

The sum of Muellers report bla bla bla...The sum??? WTF does that even mean??? He either DID IT OR DIDN'T collude... PERIOD. Hillary and Co. either did or didnt make the shit up.. THEY DID.. PERIOD. Its PROVEN....<br />News flash the evidence proving it was a lie didnt come out till after Muellers report.. Strange how that always seems to work... And here we are, you still defending the indefensible.. <br /><br />Dont get me started on the ELECTION FRAUD... Only a complete and utter idiot at this point doesn't realize it was a fraud.

Let’s just say business is good for the racial grievance industry.The Patriot Post has written before on the obvious corruption, nepotism, and intentional misappropriation of funds associated with BLM, but the rot is much worse that originally realized.First off, the Claremont Institute points out, as we have, that BLM was founded by “trained Marxists.” What is a little more disturbing is that these Marxists like Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi were influenced if not trained by Weather Underground members Eric Mann and Susan Rosenberg and militant communist Angela Davis. In the 1960s, the Weather Underground was a domestic terrorist organization that bombed, attacked, and robbed banks. It was a group of Leninist communists committed to taking down the institutions of America. Red flag number one.BLM is set up like a hydra with many heads. BLM has two parent organizations, Global Network and Movement for Black Lives, with many smaller chapters in various cities across the country. Moreover, there are 150 or so identifiable organizations that are ideologically aligned with BLM and can be considered as part of the BLM umbrella. BLM is supported by other familiar organizations like the NAACP and the ACLU. This Marxist movement is well-connected and well-funded, which should give us all pause. Red flag number two.Black Lives Matter has taken up the Marxist mantle and is incorporating a Jesse Jackson-style extortion scheme through which BLM threatens to call people racist and damage their reputations or businesses in order to get the funding it desires. The Claremont Institute has been able to track at least $82.9 billion in “donations” or “pledges” by individuals and companies to BLM.So, an ungodly amount of money is in the hands of this Marxist militant group that has gleefully shown up at every racially charged tragedy since its founding in 2013, seeking to cause chaos and spread hate. These billions of dollars represent only what the Claremont Institute was able to track. Claremont noted that money has been difficult to follow because of underreporting by companies, and also because there are several unknown organizations that might also be cover companies for BLM’s grift.Recall that in the summer of 2020, the BLM riots cost $2 billion in damages and resulted in the deaths of 25 people. Is any of that money going to the black-owned businesses or communities that the BLM riots destroyed?And who exactly is providing this income stream? To name a few: BlackRock — the corrupt investment firm — has pledged $810 million. Silicon Valley Bank — yes, the one that just crashed and the government had to bail out — gave more than $73 million. JPMorgan Chase gave $30 billion. Microsoft gave $244 million ($250,000 of which went to a bail fund for BLM rioters).Many of these companies are headed by leftist corporate heads (in other words, no one is shocked that BlackRock is financially backing BLM). Still other companies in the database gave money as a form of penance or as a virtue signal so that they satisfied their “reparations” quota or their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) bully standard.The reasoning these companies have behind bending to the grift (as if giving money will ultimately protect them, which it won’t) isn’t as scary as the political and cultural ramifications of the riots, bullying, lying, and indoctrination that BLM is bringing about. Radical leftist politicians have seen that by using these Marxist organizations, they can circumvent justice, Congress, and the will of the American people to bring about their own purposes. In the wake of the BLM riots, we saw a drastic rise in ESG initiatives, successful bullying and canceling of CEOs who wouldn’t comply, and other egregious acts of injustice in the name of woke political correctness.Combine the BLM rioting weapon with the mainstream media’s propaganda and Big Tech’s suppression of speech and dissemination of political misinformation and it seems one political party has a pretty stacked deck.https://patriotpost.us/articles/95734?mailing_id=7347&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pp.email.7347&amp;utm_campaign=snapshot&amp;utm_content=body",
