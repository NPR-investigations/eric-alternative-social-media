Jesus/Yeshua/Messiah spoke often about <i>how<\/i> to keep the Sabbath, but throughout His life, and the rest of the New Testament, there is no Biblical command that changes the Sabbath day from the 7th to the 1st day of the week. Sunday observance in the Christian church has its origins in the pagan tradition of Sun worship and has no clear Scriptural foundation. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian Sabbath-Keepers choose to keep the seventh-day Sabbath holy in loving obedience to our Creator and Savior!<br><br>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sabbathtruth.com\r\nhttps://www.seventhdaybaptist.org/sabbath\r\n\r\nhttps://brotherlance.com/commandment/\r\nhttps://www.adventist.org/the-sabbath/the-sabbath-then-and-now<br><br>\r\n\r\nGroup Rules:\r\n1.

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

Understanding legal precedents and how they interact, particularly on constitutional rights, can be tricky. That said, Biden is going where prior presidents have not – apparent disdain for rights. Examples illustrate. First, Biden’s federal mandate that employers over 100 enforce COVID vaccinations, absent a religious or health exemption, raises novel legal questions. To many, the mandate is infuriating. Enforced by OSHA, it will be litigated. What are the big issues? One is this: The Constitution’s 10th Amendment reserves all rights not expressly given to the federal government – to the American people and states. That is bound to be central.  The US Supreme Court has identified narrow federal powers under the “Supremacy Clause,” “Commerce Clause,” and 14th Amendment – with all others left to states and “the people.”Objectively, while “States rights” have eroded over time, “hard stops” do exist. This vaccine mandate may hit one or more of these “hard stops.” For reasons tied to Civil Rights and “equal protection,” federal powers are considerable. On the other hand, recent precedents make clear that states and “the people” have rights. Beyond free speech, freedom of worship, right to keep and bear arms, and enumerated freedoms, others exist. Major Supreme Court decisions point the way. For example, the 1997 Printz v. US decision “reaffirmed states’ rights and the Constitution’s anti-commandeering provisions.” Justice Scalia struck down the Brady Handgun Act – saying it violated the 10th Amendment. Why? It required local sheriffs to do background checks, “commandeering” law enforcement, telling them what to do – insisting they give up discretion. Scalia cited New York v. US (1992), which says the federal government can incentivize certain actions, not punish non-compliance.  That opinion, written by Reagan-appointee Sandra Day O’Connor, noted the federal government cannot “commandeer” or compel certain actions since doing so “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion.”  See, e.g., New York v. United States; and New York v. United States. Biden is pushing federal prosecution of parents speaking up at local school boards. This violates many norms, not least constitutional protections for free speech, federal-local control over school boards, and use of federal anti-terrorism laws, calling parents “domestic terrorists.” Again, this move contravenes well-established constitutional norms, pushing misuse of federal power (The Patriot Act), unprecedented coercion, intimidation, chilling of speech. States and parents are pushing back. See, e.g., The Patriot Act Wasn’t Meant to Target Parents; Eric Schmitt- Missouri Attorney General; OKLAHOMA PARENTS: SCHOOL-BOARD CRITICISM IS NOT ‘TERRORISM’; Opinion: Democrats have declared war on ‘school board moms’.",

We’ve seen assailants push unsuspecting victims in front of subway cars, viciously assault them in subway stations, and beat them senseless in even tony neighborhoods. This is life under woke George Soros-backed prosecutors like LA’s George Gascón, Chicago’s Kim Foxx, and Philadelphia’s Larry Krasner. Biden’s Department of Justice, meanwhile, seems like little more than a bystander in the wake of all this mayhem, although they do seem to have considerable time to raid regular Americans’ homes.The latest crime seems to take on an even weirder tone though, as a gang of felonious females decked out in neon-green bodysuits assaulted and robbed a pair of 19-year old women on a Times Square subway train, beating them and then stealing cellphones, credit cards, wallets and anything else they could get their hands on.

You’d think the green girls would be easy to spot. The New York Post reports:Video posted online shows the six women aboard the train fighting with some passengers. At least one woman can be seen repeatedly punching a victim in her face while another appears to wrap her leg around a second victim and drag her to the floor.A mother of one of the victims, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke out against the attackers:“Animals belong behind bars.

Other cities have also made similar moves, including Philadelphia. Some cities have even urged homeowners that don’t have guns to illuminate their front porches with sure-color light bulbs, ostensibly to deter criminals looking for firearms. This all sounds stupid. One common thread all criminals have is they DON’T follow the law. That’s why they are criminals! So, why not let the crooks know that everyone is unarmed? Brilliant! Well, it appears that the signs in Time Square might be working! That is if you consider slashings and assaults with bottles “working.”A Maryland tourist was smashed in the head with a bottle, slashed across the face, and robbed in Times Square over the weekend — the latest Big Apple attack on an unsuspecting out-of-towner.The 30-year-old victim was outside the CVS at 1440 Broadway in Manhattan around 4:30 a.m. Saturday when two men and a woman approached him.I am not blaming the victim, but perhaps don’t be out at 4:30 a.m. New York City might be called the city that never sleeps, but it is the city that will hit you with a bottle and rob you at 4:30 a.m. outside a CVS.Sources said that the trio tried to get the victim to buy drugs, then the woman propositioned him for sex. When the tourist refused both offers, the sources said that one of the suspects hit him in the head with a bottle and slashed him across the face with a sharp object before running off with $140.You can’t blame the victim for politely declining both offers. Buying drugs is illegal, and being from out of town, how would he have even known where to buy pills? And the proposition for sex was probably a trap. Any time that has happened to me, it has been. Kidding! Times Square sounds like a fun place to hang out without a gun!Then there was this story too:  Earlier last month, a 30-year-old tourist from Belgium was slashed in the face in an unprovoked attack at a Chelsea subway station in Manhattan, police said.And Sept. 1, a 21-year-old Big Apple visitor from St. Louis was attacked and raped at a Times Square subway station around 3 a.m., police said.It sounds like New York City should be a mandatory gun zone. Who wants to walk around a city where at any given moment, you could be slashed, beaten, raped, mugged, or run into one of the women from The View? Terrifying.Sadly, people can’t visit these large tourist cities without fear of personal injury. Tourists come from all over the world to experience the Big Apple; all they get is the worm. Eric Adams is a former police officer, yet he is so weak on crime it’s shocking. Amazing that flashing signs declaring gun-free zones haven’t worked. Maybe Adams can write a strongly worded letter to would-be crooks. Maybe that will help. Until then, I’ll take my tourist dollars somewhere I won’t get slashed for them.",

There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”.

Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm ) is only qualified to teach the new covenant (see 2 Corinthians 3:4-11 for more information).

Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical.(SIDE NOTE: The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you.In Hebrews 10:14, “For all time” means (may I have a drumroll, please) “For all time”. (That’s spiritually-speaking, or course. The rest of you? Welcome to being human.)(SIDE NOTE – In some translations, “For all time” is worded as “Forever”, “To the end” or “For eternity”.)There are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.Over the years, there has been quite a lot taught about Christianity. The problem is, many of those things simply are not in The Bible. Makes one wonder at times: Human opinion versus The Lord’s opinion...Wonder who would win? Additionally - Legalism: Sad, huh?Sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included. No one is perfect and there is no one righteous...AT ALL (Isaiah 64:6, John 8:7, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:21-26, 1 John 1:8-10). According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them. EVERYONE needs a savior (1 John 1:8-10). As long as a person is able to identify from the heart with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus...ONLY...that person is justified (Galatians 2:20-21, Romans 5:10, Romans 6:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17). Anything above and beyond that is merely some human attempting to push some “religion”, or “sin management”, or “man-plan”. (SIDE NOTE: The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.) Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you.“...and the truth shall set you free” (John 8:31-32). (Proverbs 3:5-6, Proverbs 27:17, Hebrews 4:12, Hebrews 10:14, Jude 1:23, etc. are additional motives.)Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.",

The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included. No one is perfect and there is no one righteous...AT ALL (Isaiah 64:6, John 8:7, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:21-26, 1 John 1:8-10). According to Ephesians 5:11, instructions are to have nothing to do with the deeds of darkness but rather expose them. EVERYONE needs a savior (1 John 1:8-10). As long as a person is able to identify from the heart with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus...ONLY...that person is justified (Galatians 2:20-21, Romans 5:10, Romans 6:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17). Anything above and beyond that is merely some human attempting to push some “religion”, or “sin management”, or “man-plan”. (SIDE NOTE: The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.) <br />Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you.<br /><br />“...and the truth shall set you free” (John 8:31-32). (Proverbs 3:5-6, Proverbs 27:17, Hebrews 4:12, Hebrews 10:14, Jude 1:23, etc. are additional motives.)<br /><br />Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.",
