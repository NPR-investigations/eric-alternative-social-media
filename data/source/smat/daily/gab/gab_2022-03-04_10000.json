The Digital Warriors have been instrumental in disclosing truths and bringing to light that which is corrupt and has been hidden. Our next phase is to develop working solutions to assist in the taking down of all corruption and cleaning up the mess. In short Light has exposed the weeds in the Garden Of Gaia and it is now time to pull the weeds. \r\nNo longer will simple MEME's and re-posting messages that have been shared over and over again be valuable as they once were.\r\n\r\nThus only new ideas, strategies, and NEW facts of truth are welcome.

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

I saw it on the bottom shelf the other day in a plastic handle. Looks like I need to retry for old times sake. Most of the bottom shelf handles are inported in bulk and 'independently bottled'. There is at least one firm in Scotland that ships to the USA in bulk containers. You can order up the style and quality you want. Bottom shelf is usually well whisky at the pubs. Any well Scotch will do if you intend on mixing it. No sense wasting money on something you really can't taste very well. The cheaper stuff has it's place. How do you drink Scotch?

We are going to review same of the remarks made by General Odom. General William Odom was introduced as a graduate from West Point who obtained his PhD at Columbia. He served in President Carter's National Security Council and during President Reagan's administration in the Office of the Army Chief of Staff for intelligence and for the director of Reagan's National Security Agency. He is currently director of International Security Studies at the Hudson Institute and professor of Public Policy and organization in the Department of Political Science at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is also the Director of the Security Program. Gen. Odom authored six books, the latest of which is \"The Collapse of Soviet Military.\"What I have always suspected as the real purpose of NATO was disclosed, much to my surprise, right at the beginning of the show by Gen. Odom: \"(NATO) was created not as most people think to defend against the Soviet military threat. The French didn't even mention the Soviet Union in the debate for it. They wanted NATO to deal with the German question. The British wanted NATO to keep the U.S. in Europe.\" Gen. Odom added, still remarkably candid, that \"the expansion of NATO is for the same reason; the German question versus Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary is put to bed if there is a NATO roof over it.\"The type of policy advocated by this American General is strikingly similar to the policies the Germans were accused of implementing during the Third Reich era, in the Nuremberg Trials. Here are two more passages of this conversation between McLaughlin and Gen. Odom:Mr. McLaughlin: Are we supposed to run Europe?Gen. Odom: It pays. Yes.Mr. McLaughlin: Why does it pay?Gen. Odom: You are richer today because of it.And then,Mr. McLaughlin: Can the United States defend its interests in Europe without NATO?Gen. Odom: No.One of Odom's comments brings to public attention a second player in the game, further substantiating the Germanophobic character of NATO: \"In 1994, the British foreign secretary said it would be better to have the Russians on the Adriatic than the Germans.\"I hope that this brief article will bring some light to those who still don't understand why Dresden was destroyed and why millions of Germans were exterminated in American and Russian concentration camps at the end of the war.Those who desire to verify the veracity of these quotes can order their own transcript of \"One on One\" from:Federal News Service620 National Press BuildingWashington, DC 20045(202) 347-1400The 3 June 99 response by Eric Thomson:",

The Only requirement is that it must be based on National Socialism and Historical Revisionism.                                                                                                                                                                                                  <a href=\"https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/feed?referrer=Foghornreturns\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">feed?referrer=Foghornreturns<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brother Groups List                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           These are groups that are similar to this NS group but they are not the same.

By removing his bans on new oil and gas development on federal lands, building the Keystone XL pipeline, and reinstating regulatory reforms to streamline energy permitting, we can protect our national energy security and sell to our friends rather than buy from our enemies—specifically Russia. Family budgets have already been stretched thin following record inflation. People in our states cannot afford another spike at the gas pump, and our allies cannot afford to be held hostage by Putin’s tyranny and aggression.” Joining Governor Gordon in signing the statement are: Governors Brad Little (ID), Kay Ivey (AL), Mike Dunleavy (AK), Doug Ducey (AZ), Asa Hutchinson (AR), Ron DeSantis (FL), Brian Kemp (GA), Eric Holcomb (IN), Kim Reynolds (IA), Larry Hogan (MD), Tate Reeves (MS), Mike Parson (MO), Greg Gianforte (MT), Pete Ricketts (NE), Chris Sununu (NH), Doug Burgum (ND), Kevin Stitt (OK), Henry McMaster (SC), Kristi Noem (SD), Bill Lee (TN), Greg Abbott (TX), Spencer Cox (UT), Glenn Youngkin (VA) and Jim Justice (WV)-END",

That was shown to be beyond the bar of the preponderance of evidence, but yet he is still on the National Security Commission, WTF? He committed treason, with no ramifications. We are obviously in a tyrannical administration that truly believes they are in fact ABOVE THE LAW. This is what they always scream it at every body but themselves, we hear it all the time, but just like the Covid restrictions, they once again showed us that the laws and rules are only for us.

Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.

Also on that day, the Bill of Rights was written and proposed to Congress.           There is a simple construct of our Constitution which is seldom discussed. The Constitution created the three branches of our government. The Bill of Rights, ten in number at the outset, protect us from our government.          We learn in American History class, our Founding Fathers debated the ratification of the Constitution. The two factions, The Federalists, led by Madison, Hamilton and Jay, supported ratification and the Anti-Federalists, led by Patrick Henry, opposed ratification.          The two sides struck a deal. In exchange for ratification of the Constitution, Patrick Henry secured a promise for the Bill of Rights for citizens because he “smelled a rat.”          We owe a great debt to my favorite Founder, Patrick Henry. The other Founders feared Henry’s debating skills. No one wanted to cross his tongue.          Today, when so many of us fight the infringement of our freedom, liberty and “rights” under the Bill of Rights, remember Henry’s speech he made at St. John’s Church in Richmond, Virginia on March 23, 1775 at the Second Virginia Convention in support of sending troops for the Revolution. The entire speech is worth a read. I give you the final paragraph: It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace-- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!﻿         Let us not only remember these words, may we act upon them. We should not have needed a reminder of Henry’s plea from Zelensky and his fellow countrymen.",

Cop was doing his job, trying to keep crime under control.\"A former Kansas City police detective was to be sentenced Friday for the death of a Black man who was shot while backing a pickup truck into a garage but he will remain free on bond while his conviction is appealed. Eric DeValkenaere, 43, was convicted in November of second-degree involuntary manslaughter and armed criminal action in the death of 26-year-old Cameron Lamb on Dec. 3, 2019. Prosecutors had recommended that Jackson County Circuit Court Presiding Judge J. Dale Youngs sentence DeValkenaere, who is white, to four years for involuntary manslaughter and nine years for armed criminal action, with the sentences to run at the same time. Youngs, who convicted DeValkenaere after a bench trial, ruled in February that he could remain free while his conviction is appealed. DeValkenaere’s attorney, Molly Hastings, argued the former detective was not a flight risk and noted the judge found “no evidence of malice” in DeValkenaere’s conduct.  The judge has said that he had never in 13 years on the bench allowed a defendant to remain free on bond after a conviction. But he said he did not believe it would be necessary to jail the former detective without bond to ensure he appeared at future court proceedings. DeValkenaere has been free on $30,000 bond since he was convicted. DeValkenaere testified during his trial that he shot Lamb as he was backing his pickup truck into a garage where he lived because Lamb pointed a gun at another detective, Troy Schwalm. The plainclothes detectives had followed Lamb to the property to investigate an earlier report that he had chased his girlfriend in a stolen pickup truck. Prosecutors alleged a gun found near Lamb's truck after the shooting was planted and the crime scene was staged. They also said the detectives had no reason to be on Lamb's property.When he convicted DeValkenaere, Youngs said the detectives violated Lamb's constitutional rights because they had no probable cause to believe he had committed a crime, had no warrant for Lamb’s arrest and had no search warrant or consent to be on the property.

Cop was doing his job, trying to keep crime under control.<br /><br />\"A former Kansas City police detective was to be sentenced Friday for the death of a Black man who was shot while backing a pickup truck into a garage but he will remain free on bond while his conviction is appealed. <br /><br />Eric DeValkenaere, 43, was convicted in November of second-degree involuntary manslaughter and armed criminal action in the death of 26-year-old Cameron Lamb on Dec. 3, 2019. <br /><br />Prosecutors had recommended that Jackson County Circuit Court Presiding Judge J. Dale Youngs sentence DeValkenaere, who is white, to four years for involuntary manslaughter and nine years for armed criminal action, with the sentences to run at the same time. <br /><br />Youngs, who convicted DeValkenaere after a bench trial, ruled in February that he could remain free while his conviction is appealed. DeValkenaere’s attorney, Molly Hastings, argued the former detective was not a flight risk and noted the judge found “no evidence of malice” in DeValkenaere’s conduct.  <br /><br />The judge has said that he had never in 13 years on the bench allowed a defendant to remain free on bond after a conviction. But he said he did not believe it would be necessary to jail the former detective without bond to ensure he appeared at future court proceedings. DeValkenaere has been free on $30,000 bond since he was convicted. <br /><br />DeValkenaere testified during his trial that he shot Lamb as he was backing his pickup truck into a garage where he lived because Lamb pointed a gun at another detective, Troy Schwalm. The plainclothes detectives had followed Lamb to the property to investigate an earlier report that he had chased his girlfriend in a stolen pickup truck. <br /><br />Prosecutors alleged a gun found near Lamb's truck after the shooting was planted and the crime scene was staged. They also said the detectives had no reason to be on Lamb's property.<br /><br />When he convicted DeValkenaere, Youngs said the detectives violated Lamb's constitutional rights because they had no probable cause to believe he had committed a crime, had no warrant for Lamb’s arrest and had no search warrant or consent to be on the property. <br /><br />He did not address the allegations that evidence had been planted. <br /><br />DeVlakenaere was suspended from the police force after his conviction and left the force in January. Police have not said if he was fired, resigned or retired.",

Box 61221Pasadena CA 91106e-mail address: anti_censor@hotmail.comI have often considered writing about the real purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as I see it, however, lack of means to substantiate a number of my suspicions was a major reason of discouragement. Now I have at my disposal something that can help me break the ice: an American General speaks openly, on national television, on the real reasons for the existence of NATO. What he has to say is quite interesting for the uninitiated as well as for the irreverent and the perennial skeptic. I will use this opportunity to explain same of my initial ideas on this matter.Adolf Hitler, simultaneously with Mussolini, and other European leaders, was involved in an extraordinary effort to eradicate the threat of Bolshevik tyranny from Europe. The stability of the governments they led was threatened via the USA as much, or perhaps more, than any danger that could have originated in Moscow. When Hitler's defense of Europe was forced into the military alternative the United States made an alliance with Stalin. That to me was an indication that America was becoming friendlier to Communism than to the traditional values of Western Europe. We know that American intervention resulted in a greater and stronger Soviet Russia. The Communists have indeed a debt of gratitude to America for the expansion of Bolshevism. But when the Second World War was over America \"agitated\" the anti-Communist cause and formed NATO! Why NATO? It all sounded very phony to me because if America had truly stood against Bolshevism it should have joined Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco, instead of Josef Stalin. America, of course, has never admitted to have fought on the wrong side. I can't help but asking myself when was NATO a real problem for the solidity of Soviet Communism? Certainly not when Russian tanks and the Red Army occupied the streets of Prague, or Budapest. The anti-Communism of the American Establishment has always been as serious as an Abbot and Costello movie. However, America's true concern was what Germany represented and what to this day survives in the German. Ellie Wiesel expressed similar sentiments when he advocated that every Jew must have same room in his heart for hatred against the Germans. The great difference between Wiesel and gois Franklin Delano Roosevelt and \"Ike\" Eisenhower is that Wiesel has expressed his emotions with more sincerity. The real hazard to the American Way, the America of the Gay Pride Parades and Martin Luther King Day, was not Bolshevism but the Traditional Western values that Germany had tried to maintain at the expense of a multitude of sacrifices.",

            "description_html": "<p>This group is based on &quot;Historical Revisionism&quot; so we National Socialists strive to be as close to the real NSDAP as we can. Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here.

All people MUST remember - Russia didn't start this war, and Russia isn't \"invading\" Ukraine.This war was started in early 2014 with snipers hired, armed and directed by US agents working under the orders of Biden. And this war has been conducted by the US ever since. Russia is liberating Ukraine from foreign occupation and nazi oppression. Anyone who talks about a Russian \"invasion\" can do so only in the context of the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6th, 1944. Russia is not going to \"take\" Ukraine, it is spending its own blood and treasure to give Ukraine back to the Ukrainian people.This is literally a war between GOOD and EVIL and Russia is NOT the evil one. But those who are trying to destroy Russia truly are. And either the rulers of the US and EU suffer from terminal stupidity, or they are going to destroy their own countries and populations on purpose. If NATO gets in a conventional shooting war with Russia, Russia will crush them like ants. The ONLY other option for these criminally insane bastards is the nuke option.

If the people of the US and EU allow their masters to start a war with Russia, it will not end well for them. Understand, Russia did not start this war, and we have taken the most extreme measures to minimize the death and destruction associated with this liberation.
