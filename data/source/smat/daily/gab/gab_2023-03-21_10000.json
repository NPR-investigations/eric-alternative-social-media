            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

De pleurnicher, donc. C’est certainement la chose la plus évidente que les Blancs s’acharnent à ne pas vouloir comprendre.<br /><br />Au reste, Zemmour était bien financé par deux banquiers juifs, Madar et Nadler.

What did He say? “Follow Me.”We refer to that group of people as “disciples”. Some of them were fishermen by trade. What Jesus explained to them was basically how a majority of them already knew how to fish but He wanted to train them in how to fish for people and bring them to The Kingdom of Heaven instead.Translate that: It’s cults who would push things in order to “try and score brownie points”. It’s not necessary to “get out there and witness”. Rather, it’s a matter of Matthew 5:13-16 (Salt &amp; Light) with Jesus at the helm.Here’s the difference between the real and the fake:God The Father has the work and does it. Since He owns the place, He, by choice, does the using of people to accomplish His Purposes, and that all begins with “believing in The One Who He has sent” (John 6:29).Some cults tend to try to “score brownie points” by doing the work but that has the word “FAIL” written all over it (see below). In the end, it all boils down to that stellar description of cults in Matthew 7:21-23: “Depart from Me. I never knew you.” It’s also a perfect example of what can be found in 2 Timothy 3:5: “...having a form of godliness but denying its power.” False religions are also in those categories, unfortunately.“Salvation by works” never works. No one is saved BY good works but rather UNTO them. HUMONGOUS difference (Isaiah 64:6, Matthew 5:13-16, John 6:29, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10, Titus 3:4-8). It is impossible to goody two shoes into Heaven. Jesus did 100% of everything salvation-wise (Mark 1:15, John 14:6, John 19:30). By comparison, a human does 100% of nothing (John 15:5). Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). God The Father’s The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not the Gospel message (1 John 3:23, 1 John 5:10). Those born again will automatically “remain” in Jesus.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father). Seventh Day Adventism is probably the creepiest cult out there. All of the others are blatant fakes but SDA merely “blends in like another denomination” (whatever a “denomination” is...).It’s not even REMOTELY close, actually. The list is long. That’s tragic, actually. Forever’s a long time.By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. A person ultimately only affects him or herself and forever’s a long time. We’re under grace.There are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.",
