            "description": "This group embraces the traditionalism of those pioneers of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s known as the New Conservatives. The New Conservatives were a loose group of conservative academics and scholars who after the crisis of World War II revived interest in Western civilization and American cultural renewal. The New Conservatives also brought about a renaissance in the study of the life and work of Anglo-Irish statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke. Their immediate forebears included the New Humanists, the Distributists, T. S. Eliot, Ralph Adams Cram, C. S. Lewis, Herbert Agar, Bernard Iddings Bell, Christopher Dawson, and the Southern Agrarians.\nArticles:\n\"Understanding Traditionalist Conservatism\" by Mark C.

The change was made without having gone through any rulemaking process to allow the change.<br />The U.S. Dept of Agriculture said it’s using its child nutrition programs to push voter registration and enlisting state, local, and federally funded employees to implement voter registration drives in local schools.<br />The Commerce Dept produced a massive, 113-page report which likely took four agency officials many hours to generate. It directs local voting board members about polling stations and poll worker training.<br />Our Friends from TGP further commented:<br />We all know now that the Democrats need lots of names in order to steal an election. This is a big part of their election strategy so it’s not surprising that the Biden gang would be doing this.  These are Communist tactics. Steal an election, claiming it wasn’t stolen, and then put in policies to steal all elections into the future.  We saw this in Lenin’s Russia, Chavez’s Venezuela, and every communist country since.  Eventually, citizens give up and stop voting because they know their vote means nothing.<br />TGP identified the ERIC system used by the Democrats to build voter rolls.  This is now in 31 states and is funded with George Soros money.<br />Most experts investigating the 2020 Election believe that bloated voter rolls were necessary to steal that election. This isn’t about getting these people to vote, it’s about getting names to associate with fraudulent ballots.",

Here, we see on image that glober 'Flat Earth debunk' website provided so I could trash dump ball model using their own cartoon, it shows along white dashed lines top and bottom moon are inverted and upside down relative to each other. While this is definitely what we do see due to Earth being Flat, if you look at the 'C' shown on moon in anti-Flat Earth glerfer glober website image, the moon never inverts position relative to NP person or SP person. Look at top left moon image.Both NP and SP show match. Look at bottom left moon image.Neither NP or SP show match. There is only 1 moon direction visible from NP or SP of ball model here, and that is the moon image at top left that matched NP and SP moon face visibility. Bottom left moon face should be, but just is not visible on ball. Don't you love when ball organizations claim they can 'debunk Flat Earth' and they end up debunking the ball instead? For reference, I have included locations showing moon faces nearly inverted on Flat Earth, but ball model cannot do this due to both NP and SP curving back under and away from moon instead of 180° Flat plane line.

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",
