There were no employees. There were no servers. There was no ERIC presence of any kind.“Instead, I found a virtual office that is rentable by the day. What it was missing was people, servers and any sign of the ERIC team.”ERIC’s published address is 1201 Connecticut Ave NW Ste 600 in Washington, DC., but Allen found that the location is actually operated by Expansive, a company that offers virtual workspaces across the country and rents space by the day.

Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

We&#39;ve shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it&#39;s an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. &quot;Antarctic Treaty&quot; prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We&#39;re at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you&#39;re no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false &quot;echo chamber&quot; stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.<\/p>",

In fact, one might even call it anti-racist.\n\nMedical Xpress:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe rare blood clot side-effect associated with some COVID-19 vaccines could be the result of genetics, new research has found, paving the way for a potential genetic screening test.\n...\nNow, a new study by Professor Tom Gordon, Dr. Jing Jing Wang and colleagues from Flinders University and SA Pathology, may help to explain what’s causing the rare side effect. The study has been published on the pre-print server medRxiv and has yet to be peer reviewed.\n\nThe researchers looked at five unrelated people who had all experienced the clotting complication, finding all of the patients had unusually structured antibodies against a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is involved in blood clotting.\n\nAdditionally, all five had a specific version of a gene responsible for producing these antibodies.\n…\nThe researchers then found that all of the patients carried a specific variant of one gene, called IGLV3-21*02, most commonly occurring in people of European descent.\n…\nWhile the reason why only a tiny proportion of human vaccine recipients have this antibody requires further research, the authors say identifying the gene could make it possible to produce a genetic screening tool to identify patients who are at risk of this severe complication.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt’s shocking that an injection created by Jews, which Jews then forced people to take, would just coincidentally harm white people more than other races.\n\nAt this point, my position is that anyone who took these vaccines really just gets what they deserve.\n\nThe vax and the entire coronavirus hoax was pushed most aggressively by the World Economic Forum. Here is WEF leader Klaus Schwab’s top advisor, the Jew Noah Harari, saying that we need to get rid of humans:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4Q-dOZCzBSo\n\nBut they want to save you with a vaccine.\n\nThe Jewish Obamacare architect (and now top Biden coronavirus advisor) Zeke Emanuel was the first person I heard transforming “two weeks to flatten the curve” into “permanent lockdown until everyone is vaccinated.”\n(Cont/) https://dailystormer.cn/the-science-vax-induced-blood-clots-most-common-among-whites-because-of-genetics/'",

How is it possible that not one of the hundreds of thousands of people that NASA has employed over the decades has come forward and admitted the hoax?

How is it possible that not one of the hundreds of thousands of people that NASA has employed over the decades has come forward and admitted the hoax?  What about the Russians, the Chinese, the Japanese and all the other government space agencies along with SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin and other corporate space enterprises?

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Accounts who post ANY Globe propaganda videos or pictures will be removed without warning, false \"echo chamber\" stops here, you can argue your point (if you have one) with your own words.",

Dino is a self-taught artist, musician &amp; teacher from Boston whose work can be found at http://www.ARTofDiNo.com (artofdino@gmail.com). Together with his wife Erin Sarah of http://www.ARTofErinSarah.com, they formed a 501c3 public charity known as Save eARTh (http://www.SaveeARTh.us) with the goal of Saving eARTh with Art and HeART forever. Each Artwork is designed to expand the minds of all people of all ages in order to help everyone envision the infinite realm of potential we are all collectively re-discovering. These visions are meticulously crafted and packed with interconnecting symbolism that weaves a timeless story based on the perceptions of the viewer.Flat Earth FAQ is the culmination of over a decade's worth of deep research and writing on this most important subject jam-packed into an easily digestible reference book available in paperback, PDF and EPub/Kindle versions.  As many of you know, I have vowed never to stop my activism until the NWO dies or I do, and I see flat Earth as the Achilles' Heel of the New World Order.  This subject, supposedly the most crackpot of all conspiracy theories, mocked and ridiculed for centuries as being an ignorant unscientific worldview, is actually one of the most easily demonstrable and empirically evidenced facts of reality.  When humanity finally wakes up to the truth of our flat Earth, it will usher in a veritable new age of enlightenment, a renaissance of common sense, and an opportunity to finally and forever expose and expunge these deceivers among us.  As with all of my books, the contents will all soon be available FREE in article, video, and audiobook forms for those who cannot afford them.

Together with his wife Erin Sarah of http://www.ARTofErinSarah.com, they formed a 501c3 public charity known as Save eARTh (http://www.SaveeARTh.us) with the goal of Saving eARTh with Art and HeART forever. Each Artwork is designed to expand the minds of all people of all ages in order to help everyone envision the infinite realm of potential we are all collectively re-discovering. These visions are meticulously crafted and packed with interconnecting symbolism that weaves a timeless story based on the perceptions of the viewer.Flat Earth FAQ is the culmination of over a decade's worth of deep research and writing on this most important subject jam-packed into an easily digestible reference book available in paperback, PDF and EPub/Kindle versions.  As many of you know, I have vowed never to stop my activism until the NWO dies or I do, and I see flat Earth as the Achilles' Heel of the New World Order.  This subject, supposedly the most crackpot of all conspiracy theories, mocked and ridiculed for centuries as being an ignorant unscientific worldview, is actually one of the most easily demonstrable and empirically evidenced facts of reality.  When humanity finally wakes up to the truth of our flat Earth, it will usher in a veritable new age of enlightenment, a renaissance of common sense, and an opportunity to finally and forever expose and expunge these deceivers among us.  As with all of my books, the contents will all soon be available FREE in article, video, and audiobook forms for those who cannot afford them.

Together with his wife Erin Sarah of http://www.ARTofErinSarah.com, they formed a 501c3 public charity known as Save eARTh (http://www.SaveeARTh.us) with the goal of Saving eARTh with Art and HeART forever. Each Artwork is designed to expand the minds of all people of all ages in order to help everyone envision the infinite realm of potential we are all collectively re-discovering. These visions are meticulously crafted and packed with interconnecting symbolism that weaves a timeless story based on the perceptions of the viewer.Flat Earth FAQ is the culmination of over a decade's worth of deep research and writing on this most important subject jam-packed into an easily digestible reference book available in paperback, PDF and EPub/Kindle versions.  As many of you know, I have vowed never to stop my activism until the NWO dies or I do, and I see flat Earth as the Achilles' Heel of the New World Order.  This subject, supposedly the most crackpot of all conspiracy theories, mocked and ridiculed for centuries as being an ignorant unscientific worldview, is actually one of the most easily demonstrable and empirically evidenced facts of reality.  When humanity finally wakes up to the truth of our flat Earth, it will usher in a veritable new age of enlightenment, a renaissance of common sense, and an opportunity to finally and forever expose and expunge these deceivers among us.  As with all of my books, the contents will all soon be available FREE in article, video, and audiobook forms for those who cannot afford them.  Thanks so much to everyone who has helped over the years to support me and my mission of spreading the flat Earth truth to the entire flat world by purchasing and giving away my books to anyone and everyone who will read them!  http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/ericdubay",
