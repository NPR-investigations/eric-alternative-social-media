It asks all kinds of prying questions, including gender and sexual orientation and views on racial issues. Licwinko and her husband, Eric, became concerned in September when their sons’ school, North Hunterdon High School, told parents they were sending students a Panorama survey. Although they opted their sons out, as parents are ostensibly allowed to do, their sons were sent the survey anyway. What’s more, a school official confirmed to them, the private information of all students – including whether they receive special education services and free and reduced meals – was sent across four state lines to Panorama, based in Boston. Last week, Panorama refused to give the Licwinkos the data the company received on their children.“They are data mining and psychologically profiling our kids.

It asks all kinds of prying questions, including gender and sexual orientation and views on racial issues. Licwinko and her husband, Eric, became concerned in September when their sons’ school, North Hunterdon High School, told parents they were sending students a Panorama survey. Although they opted their sons out, as parents are ostensibly allowed to do, their sons were sent the survey anyway. What’s more, a school official confirmed to them, the private information of all students – including whether they receive special education services and free and reduced meals – was sent across four state lines to Panorama, based in Boston. Last week, Panorama refused to give the Licwinkos the data the company received on their children.<br /><br />“They are data mining and psychologically profiling our kids. The questions they are asking are absolutely inappropriate in a school setting,” says Licwinko. “Schools have sold our children’s privacy to a data analytics company that is tracking attendance, behavior, and family’s financial status.”  <br /><a href=\"https://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2021/10/27/the_data_mining_of_americas_kids_should_be_a_national_scandal_110659.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>realcleareducation.com/articles/2021/10/27/th<span class=\"invisible\">e_data_mining_of_americas_kids_should_be_a_national_scandal_110659.htm<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

          "content": "Nodding off on Park Avenue: Seven junkies shoot up together in Harlem just blocks away from three schools as New York City returns to the bad old days of the 1980s.A group of men were pictured taking drugs out in the open near New York City's La Marqueta marketplace, in East Harlem, as vagrancy and crime continues to run rampant in the Big Apple. Photos and video of the men lying on Park Avenue between 115th E Street and 116 E Street outside the small but popular marketplace show them casually using needles to inject drugs into their arms and over the weekend. The men sit underneath the railway surrounded by bags of their belongings and an overturned Citi bike, and photos of the block the following day show even more men shooting up drugs at the site. Although the area is primarily a shopping district, many families pass by the marketplace as it borders the Cooke School Institute, which teaches special education students from ages 5 to 21, as well as the P.S. 57 and and P.S. 155 Elementary Schools. The marketplace is also nearby the New York City Housing Authority's East Harlem office and the East Harlem Neighborhood Health Action Center.   The scene comes despite NYC Mayor Eric Adam's vow to crackdown on homelessness and crime in the city, which is up nearly 40 percent from last year.New Yorkers have been growing weary over the latest spike in violence and crimes on the city streets and subways.While murders and shootings are down 10 and roughly five percent respectively from 2021, overall crime in the Big Apple is up 39.24 percent so far in 2022.That includes a 19 percent rise in felony assaults, a nearly 15 percent increase in rapes and a 40 percent jump in robberies.Vagrancy has also been on the rise in the city, with Adams ordering wave after wave of officers to take down homeless encampments throughout the city since March.  City officials said police have taken down more than 300 camps throughout the five boroughs, but the homeless continue to rebuild their encampments, claiming that the city's homeless shelters are 'dangerous' and not an adequate solution to its vagrancy problem.",

Millian was also the subject of a July 24, 2016 email in which Fusion GPS’s other founder, Glenn Simpson, provided Hamburger three email addresses for Millian—an apparent push for the journalist to focus on Millian as part of the Russia collusion theme.Fusion GPS’s Fritsch also pushed Millian on The New York Times’s Eric Lichtblau, telling Lichtblau in a September 27, 2016, email that Millian’s http://“Russianamericanchamber.com was using an IP address registered in Moscow and Alfa was its internet service provider.” That email included several screen grabs for the Times reporter showing the supposed connection between Millian and Russia. And, of course, Millian was later framed as a sub-source in the Steele dossier.Other emails unearthed during the special counsel’s investigation of Sussmann likewise featured Lichtblau. In fact, until late last week, Sussmann intended to call Lichtblau to testify in his defense, but Sussmann dropped the Times reporter from his witness list after prosecutors made clear they intended to question Lichtblau extensively on his communications with various sources.Lawyers for Sussmann nonetheless argued to the jury that Sussmann went to Baker with the Alfa Bank “intel” to give the FBI a heads up that the Times would soon be running a story on the secret communications network. Emails between Lichtblau and Fusion GPS seemed to negate that theory, however, while revealing the symbiotic relationship between the Clinton campaign opposition research firm and the journalist.For instance, in an October 5, 2016, email thread between Fusion GPS’s Fritsch and Lichtblau, Fritsch provided the Times reporter the data showing the supposed Alfa Bank connection. And when Lichtblau asked the source of the data, Fritsch replied “No idea. Our tech maven says it was first posted via Reddit.”That Lichtblau saw this data for the first time only after Sussmann met with Baker strongly suggests Sussmann’s excuse for sharing the “intel” with the FBI’s general counsel—to give the bureau a heads-up to the story—was bunk. The October 5, 2016, email exchange with Lichtblau proves fascinating for a second reason when read in light of the two versions of the Slate article that ran on October 31, 2016, when Foer broke the Alfa Bank story.",
