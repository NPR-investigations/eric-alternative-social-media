You just assaulted me,” Adams deadpanned after host Trevor Noah embraced him upon entrance — a clear dig at the former mayor.Giuliani was chatting with locals after returning from the men’s room at the Staten Island ShopRite on Sunday when store worker Daniel Gill came up behind him and slapped him on the back, video of the incident shows. The former two-term mayor and legal adviser to Donald Trump was stumping for his son, Andrew, who was running in the Republican primary for governor.Gill, 39, was initially charged with second-degree assault in the incident — although the charges were downgraded to third-degree harassment and harassment. Giuliani said he felt like “someone shot me” when Gill slapped him on the back from behind, while video surveillance showed a brief and not violent encounter.“That person that he falsely reported spent 24 hours in jail.

          "contentraw": "Eric Adams calls on DA to prosecute Giuliani, who demands mayor resign<br />nypost ^ | 6/29/2022 | Carl Campanile and Bernadette Hogan and Bernadette Hogan<br /><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/06/29/eric-adams-calls-on-da-to-prosecute-rudy-giuliani/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>nypost.com/2022/06/29/eric-adams-calls-on-da-<span class=\"invisible\">to-prosecute-rudy-giuliani/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Mayor Eric Adams has urged Staten Island DA Mike McMahon to consider prosecuting ex-Mayor Rudy Giuliani for allegedly filing a false police report, to which Giuliani responded by calling for Adams to quit over the city’s crime crisis.<br /><br />“[Giuliani] falsely reported a crime and the DA should take that seriously,” Hizzoner said during an appearance on the “The Daily Show” Tuesday night, where he both mocked and scorned Giuliani in the ongoing spat between the two.<br /><br />“You don’t realize. You just assaulted me,” Adams deadpanned after host Trevor Noah embraced him upon entrance — a clear dig at the former mayor.<br /><br />Giuliani was chatting with locals after returning from the men’s room at the Staten Island ShopRite on Sunday when store worker Daniel Gill came up behind him and slapped him on the back, video of the incident shows. The former two-term mayor and legal adviser to Donald Trump was stumping for his son, Andrew, who was running in the Republican primary for governor.<br /><br />Gill, 39, was initially charged with second-degree assault in the incident — although the charges were downgraded to third-degree harassment and harassment. Giuliani said he felt like “someone shot me” when Gill slapped him on the back from behind, while video surveillance showed a brief and not violent encounter.<br /><br />“That person that he falsely reported spent 24 hours in jail. That’s not acceptable,” said Adams, continuing criticism he first leveled earlier Tuesday at the man hailed as “America’s Mayor” following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack.<br /><br />Adams then referenced the case of Amy Cooper — the Central Park “Karen” who sparked international outrage in 2020 when she called the cops on a black birdwatcher who asked her to leash her dog.

I was kindly invited on the panel by Freedom Fest Platinum Sponsor, Epik- to which I am still extremely grateful for the invitation. As of Monday, Freedom Fest’s Matthew Day decided that I was “too controversial” due to my Christian beliefs and was afraid that I would clash with the overwhelmingly atheist presence at Freedom Fest. This decision came after I submitted my bio to Matthew Day- which included my testimony of God’s grace and described my passion for Jesus Christ after he delivered me from a life of drug abuse. Just a reminder that at events like Freedom Fest, the “Freedom” only applies to those who stay within the status quo. I have always remained extremely respectful and professional at every event I have attended, and this cancellation is not just an attempt to silence me, but an attempt to silence all passionate, Jesus-loving American Christians who stand up and call out evil for what it is.Freedom Fest has also cancelled Nick Fuentes’ Documentary “The Most Canceled Man In America” and that is where my team and I will be. I suggest every person who truly believes in Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly, and the Freedom to Fight for truth attends this screening.You can purchase tickets to this screening by visiting: http://AmericaFirstFoundation.org/VegasThank you, and I look forward to seeing my America First friends in Vegas on July 14th.

However, a New York Times report says Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials are operating in Ukraine “secretly, mostly in the capital, Kyiv”.…The New York Times reports CIA officers are in Kiev to pass intelligence to Ukrainian officials, and special operations forces from several allied countries are training Ukrainian troops near the battlefield. The covert operations in Ukraine are a part of a significant effort by Western governments to weaken Russia.Citing unnamed current and former officials, the NYT explains the CIA has officers secretly deployed to Kiev to give intelligence about the war to Ukrainian officials. “CIA personnel have continued to operate in the country secretly, mostly in the capital, Kiev, directing much of the massive amounts of intelligence the United States is sharing with Ukrainian forces,” Eric Schmitt writes in the NYT.Some Ukrainian military officers say the American intelligence is having an impact on the battlefield. The NYT describes the process as the CIA making satellite photos available to the Ukrainian forces near the front lines with tablets. Kiev’s soldiers can use the tablets to access a battlefield mapping app to assist in targeting Russian troops.The report from the NYT is the first admission that Americans are on the ground in Ukraine. President Joe Biden has pledged not to deploy American forces to Ukraine and withdrew 150 soldiers training Ukrainian forces before Russia invaded on February 24.However, several of America’s NATO allies have filled that void. According to the NYT, special operations forces from Britain, France, Canada and Lithuania are training Ukrainian forces near the frontlines. The role of the commandos is to train and advise Ukrainian troops and provide a conduit for weapons. Schmitt admits his article does not describe the complete activities of the CIA and European commandos in Ukraine.The presence of CIA officers and commandos in Ukraine appears to contradict previous stories in CNN and the NYT. On June 8, Julia Barnes wrote in the New York Times that the US intelligence community had “blind spots” in Ukraine. On April 19, a CNN article noted the White House can only monitor weapons entering Ukraine for a short time before they enter into a “black hole,” and the US has almost “zero ability” to track the weapons. Both reports emphasize the US intelligence community’s lack of operations within Ukraine to explain their inability to collect more complete information on the war.",

On April 19, a CNN article noted the White House can only monitor weapons entering Ukraine for a short time before they enter into a “black hole,” and the US has almost “zero ability” to track the weapons. Both reports emphasize the US intelligence community’s lack of operations within Ukraine to explain their inability to collect more complete information on the war.",

Last night, the woman you just saw, Tina Peters, lost her bid for secretary of state, so of course the whole point of targeting her. Peters would not be a last opponent of the Biden administration running for office to be targeted by the justice department. On June 3rd, Peter Navarro, a trained aide to Donald Trump, was arrested at Washington national airport and put in leg irons and put in jail. Why? Well, days earlier he sued the January 6th committee, claimed executive privilege with his comedic agents with the president. This is a decades-old standard. And rather than go to court, they had him arrested at the airport and sent to jail in irons. Showed what happened to him. Speak with mission of that partisan witch hunt, kangaroo committee, which is unduly authorized and not properly constituted and has no subpoena power, they have only one mission, to concoct a fake hoax on January 6th based on criminal Trump to prevent them from for reelection and taking back the white house in 2025, January. That is all this is about. &gt;&gt; Tucker: so a decade ago, the Obama administration was caught sending automatic weapons to Mexican drug cartels and congress wanted to know about it. Eric holder, then the attorney general, had key role in the scam operation Fast and Furious, you may remember it. They subpoenaed him and the media posited, he was taking a noble position. When Steve Bannon order Peter Navarro try to do that, they went to jail. We had the exact same thing happen in public ten years ago, a public judge ruled Holder’s claim was not legitimate and he was still never arrested. But the rules have changed. Why is that? No one in corporate media ever asked that question. Instead, they celebrated Peter Navarro’s arrest, a 70-year-old man in an airport. It made their day. &gt;&gt; he was indicted. And when you are indicted, you are arrested. &gt;&gt; what peter Navarro did was so far out-of-bounds and so indefensible. This prosecution is really about punishing Navarro based on his blatant disrespect for the congressional subpoena. &gt;&gt;",
