The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

Crime down on New York City subways?Hotair ^ | 01/28/2023 | Jazz Shawhttps://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2023/01/28/could-it-be-true-crime-down-on-nyc-subways-n526983Back in October, New York City Mayor Eric Adams made a joint announcement with Governor Kathy Hochul regarding a new public safety plan for the Big Apple. Dubbed the “Cops, Cameras and Care” program, they claimed that they would be adding more than one thousand additional police officers to the MTA force patrolling the subways. More surveillance cameras would be installed and they would begin moving most of the homeless out of the tunnels and into shelters. The state would provide a significant chunk of the money needed to make that happen. I’ll confess to having been a bit dubious when they made that announcement. We hear plenty of big talk from New York politicians, but it rarely translates into productive action. But perhaps they actually did something right this time. It was announced yesterday that a significant drop in subway crime rates has been observed over the past few months.The rate of subway crime in the Big Apple has declined since the launch of a new safety plan in October, Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Friday.During a joint appearance at the Fulton Transit Center in Lower Manhattan, officials unveiled NYPD figures that showed subway crimes were now occurring at a rate of 1.7 incidents per 1 million riders, down from 2.3 incidents in 2021 and 2022.The rate is now nearly at the same level of 1.5 incidents per 1 million riders before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which ridership plunged and crime spiked to 2.8 per 1 million.It’s not that often that we have the opportunity to celebrate any good news coming out of our larger cities, so I try to take that chance when the occasion arises. And if these numbers continue to remain down through the rest of the winter and the spring, we may be seeing a trend toward improvement. Crime rates in the subway system almost doubled over the course of the pandemic and through most of last year.Another major improvement has been the significantly reduced number of homeless people in the tunnels, though that took many months to accomplish. The city has reportedly moved more than 3,000 homeless people into various shelters that have been established or expanded. Wherever you find large congregations of the homeless, you see increases in nearly all forms of crime. It’s just a fact of life.The question now is whether or not these new policies can be sustained. The city has already burned through 62 million dollars in state funding to cover all of the costs associated with this expanded police presence. That money is going to be running out in the near future and New York’s City Council hasn’t even suggested they will be able to replace it with existing municipal funds without making major cuts elsewhere in the budget.That fact should remind us of the underlying reality. Having the funding put in place for these programs was critical, but cash doesn’t make crime rates drop. These gains were achieved by the men and women of the NYPD who are out there every night putting their lives on the line. This should also be the final nail in the coffin of the entire “defund the police” movement. When New York’s police had their budget cut and their numbers dwindled, crime rates rose dramatically. When the funding was expanded and the force numbers increased, crime dropped in response. Is this really still a mystery to anyone? It shouldn’t be. It’s just a shame that we had to produce so many more victims of crime in New York City for more than two years to drive that lesson home. So let’s do away entirely with all of this “defund the police” nonsense once and for all, shall we?",

The city has reportedly moved more than 3,000 homeless people into various shelters that have been established or expanded. Wherever you find large congregations of the homeless, you see increases in nearly all forms of crime. It’s just a fact of life.<br /><br />The question now is whether or not these new policies can be sustained. The city has already burned through 62 million dollars in state funding to cover all of the costs associated with this expanded police presence. That money is going to be running out in the near future and New York’s City Council hasn’t even suggested they will be able to replace it with existing municipal funds without making major cuts elsewhere in the budget.<br /><br />That fact should remind us of the underlying reality. Having the funding put in place for these programs was critical, but cash doesn’t make crime rates drop. These gains were achieved by the men and women of the NYPD who are out there every night putting their lives on the line. This should also be the final nail in the coffin of the entire “defund the police” movement. When New York’s police had their budget cut and their numbers dwindled, crime rates rose dramatically. When the funding was expanded and the force numbers increased, crime dropped in response. Is this really still a mystery to anyone? It shouldn’t be. It’s just a shame that we had to produce so many more victims of crime in New York City for more than two years to drive that lesson home. So let’s do away entirely with all of this “defund the police” nonsense once and for all, shall we?",

The British Flag has TWO Christian symbols on it, the St George and St Andrew crosses. If you look at all the Old flags of Europe--they all had Christian symbology. NOT with the American flag. The symbol on the American flag is a star--that is the symbol of Judeo-Masonic-Bolshevism. The star reappears as a symbol of the USSR, another Judeo-Masonic-Bolshevist creation. The Star appears as a symbol for the Chinese, North Korean and North Vietnamese military insignia and flags! The Star also appears on the flag of the European Union! The Star is the symbol of Judeo-Masonic Bolshevism, of the Hermetic/Kabbalist system. George Washington was a full blown Mason; he was in Masonic regalia when he set the cornerstone for the capitol. Freemasonry is Noahidism. Deism. Thomas Jefferson was a Socianist---meaning, he did not accept the orthodox Catholic teaching that God is a Trinity!  He was not a member of Masonry but went to Masonic meetings and had both Masonic and Rosicrucian literature in his library. He was NOT a Christian but a Deist, which is NOT Christianity. The first commandant of West Point was a Rosicrucian. Now, we come to the symbology of the US Seal. Any Christian symbology on the US Seal?   NO. The All-seeing Eye pyramid and the phrases are all Illuminati/Freemasonry!  America was NOT founded as a Christian nation. Every academic out there understands that America is the product of the Enlightenment which was NOT Christian but Atheist!  America was born with a Janus face---a Duplicity. Yes, some of the common people were fundamentalist Protestants. other common people were atheists and true blue gnostics. The Puritans were not Orthodox Catholic Christians but PURE Gnostics!  (q.v. Eric Voegelin's works)  Much of the Leadership of America were Masons or Rosicrucians---and that is part of the Hermetic/Kabbalistic cultural stream from the Renaissance. As I pointed out, all revolutions in the West are based on Apocalypsism  which means that America is a Religious state, not Christian---but is a Jewish state since all Apocalpsism arises from Jewish sentiment.  America is \"For the Jews, by the Jews, and of the Jews\". The Anglicans called Puritans demi-Jews and Masons are pseudo-Jews. America is a farrago of conflicting interests and parties. So the symbols of America show its Occult foundations. Google Occult and America. Do your own research. https://watchmanministries.net/religio-political/freemasons-and-founding-of-america/",
