I have a background of working globally with large databases. For multinational companies. I can tell you what is possible with the access ERIC has. I could use their access to identify people that should be registered to move an election in a particular direction. I could identify people that are almost certainly not going to register or vote. I could in six months build list and scripts to create registrations of the people that are almost certainly not going to vote or register. I could have them built in many layers to be added as needed with slowly graduating amounts of risk of people voting starting with zero and working the way higher slowly. Now this is where it get really scary. If you gave my team the access ERIC has for 6 months we could do one of two things. We could do the job we were hired to do for millions of dollars. The databases would be very clean. Perfect is not possible but no amateur would be finding any major number of bad registrations. Or if you added admin access to the election database on election night. Gave us a 4-6 hour pause in counting. We could hand you the (S)election of your choice. And do it with data that looks valid enough (registrations created using data from the special access we had to the DMV, etc) the only way you would find the fraud would be to go and canvas the voting districts.

With these database accesses they should be able to identify and correct huge amounts of data very quickly. How ever in every dataset I have reviewed they have not even identified and corrected the registrations with a birth date older then the oldest living American. So what has ERIC been doing. I have a background of working globally with large databases. For multinational companies. I can tell you what is possible with the access ERIC has. I could use their access to identify people that should be registered to move an election in a particular direction. I could identify people that are almost certainly not going to register or vote. I could in six months build list and scripts to create registrations of the people that are almost certainly not going to vote or register. I could have them built in many layers to be added as needed with slowly graduating amounts of risk of people voting starting with zero and working the way higher slowly. Now this is where it get really scary. If you gave my team the access ERIC has for 6 months we could do one of two things. We could do the job we were hired to do for millions of dollars. The databases would be very clean. Perfect is not possible but no amateur would be finding any major number of bad registrations. Or if you added admin access to the election database on election night. Gave us a 4-6 hour pause in counting. We could hand you the (S)election of your choice. And do it with data that looks valid enough (registrations created using data from the special access we had to the DMV, etc) the only way you would find the fraud would be to go and canvas the voting districts. In fact to make matters worse if we really wanted to we could clean the database and hand you the (S)election making it even harder to figure out were the fraud came from.",
