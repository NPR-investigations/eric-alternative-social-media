You know the New Age expression, \"Do what you love and the money will follow.\" So do what you love. That is what you are here to do. You can spend hours and hours worrying about manifesting a sufficient financial situation to survive here, or you could just do what you love and trust. And if you don't know what you love, you can go inside and ask for guidance and do what occurs to you in that moment. The unfoldment and activation that we are speaking of is a moment-to-moment experience of following your feelings and your heart, and acting upon those impulses that you feel from within rather than reacting to external impulses. The external impulses that are available to you at this time to draw upon are sheer lunacy. The thought patterns that are out there for you to draw upon are not entirely healthy for you. The thought patterns and programming that you have experienced in your lives and that are active now in the world are counter-productive to the ascension path. All the fears and worries and negative programming are all based upon the belief that you are poor, pitiful mortals, trapped in a body, struggling to survive in third-dimensional reality. You see, the very foundation of belief that this world has used to attempt to program human beings is based on illusion. You are immortal beings. You are powerful beings. There is nothing that can stop you in your activation and in attaining your complete ascension in this lifetime.\"Ashtar, through Eric KleinThe Inner Door; Channeled Discourses from the Ascended Masters on Self-Mastery and AscensionVolume One",

The unfoldment and activation that we are speaking of is a moment-to-moment experience of following your feelings and your heart, and acting upon those impulses that you feel from within rather than reacting to external impulses. The external impulses that are available to you at this time to draw upon are sheer lunacy. The thought patterns that are out there for you to draw upon are not entirely healthy for you. The thought patterns and programming that you have experienced in your lives and that are active now in the world are counter-productive to the ascension path. All the fears and worries and negative programming are all based upon the belief that you are poor, pitiful mortals, trapped in a body, struggling to survive in third-dimensional reality. You see, the very foundation of belief that this world has used to attempt to program human beings is based on illusion. You are immortal beings. You are powerful beings. There is nothing that can stop you in your activation and in attaining your complete ascension in this lifetime.\"<br /><br />Ashtar, through Eric Klein<br />The Inner Door; Channeled Discourses from the Ascended Masters on Self-Mastery and Ascension<br />Volume One",

The victim was taken to the hospital in a stable condition. It's unclear if he lives in the building or if he was working there. The gunman opened fire shortly after midnight last night. He fled the building and remains on the run on Monday morning. Police do not yet know what his motive was, and they have not released any surveillance footage of the incident. An NYPD spokesman told http://DailyMail.com on Monday morning that the gunman has a 'dark complexion' but they gave no additional details. The building where the shooting occurred is 1 QPS - one of many new luxury high-rises in the up-and-coming neighborhood. The city's latest shooting comes after seven other people were shot and injured in a separate shootings in New York City overnight. On Monday morning, New York State Assemblyman Mike Lawler said Adams - who is a regular on the glitzy NYC nightlife circuit - should 'stop partying' and focus on crime. 'Mayor Adams really needs to act. He's really got to stop spending his time partying and start focusing on the job at hand, and crime is number one. 'Obviously Mayor Adams inherited a mess from Bill de Blasio, but unfortunately, he really hasn't been able to turn the tide here.' On Sunday, Adams made an appearance at the Puerto Rican Day parade in Manhattan. In recent months, he has been a regular at swanky private members club Zero Bond. He also attended the Met Gala in May, wearing an anti-gun violence jacket.  The building where Sunday's shooting took place has a rooftop pool, state-of-the-art amenities and a one bedroom apartment was recently leased for $4,800.",

Donald Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani raged at the January 6 committee on Monday, claiming lawmakers 'have no case' as they were presenting evidence in their second of six hearings.The event largely focused on Giuliani's role in pushing Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged.'They have no case,' the former New York City mayor said on Trump adviser Steve Bannon's War Room podcast. 'This is a follow-up to Russian collusion, Ukrainian conversation - the millions of hours they’ve spent trying to find a crime on Donald Trump and can’t do it.''They started this frame about five years ago. It’s the same cast of characters - Bennie Thompson, and shifty [Adam] Schiff, you see [Eric] Swalwell, not on the committee, but in the background.'He went on to say that the committee's Vice Chair Liz Cheney was 'hysterical' and had 'gone off the deep end' - though he appeared to confuse her momentarily with sister Mary Cheney.  Cheney said during her opening statement that Trump 'rejected the advice of his campaign experts on election night' in favor of advice from 'an apparently inebriated Rudy Giuliani' who told him to declare victory that night and insist the vote count be stopped 'to falsely claim everything was fraudulent.' Giuliani denied the assertion that he was drunk through his lawyer - despite multiple former Trump advisers being shown to have made the claim.'Giuliani denies all falsehoods by the angry and misguided Ms Cheney,' his attorney told CNN. During Bannon's podcast Giuliani called lawmakers on the committee 'criminals' and claimed they were simply trying to 'frame Trump for something he didn't do.'Newly-revealed video shows multiple Trump advisers were concerned about the veracity of the former mayor's election fraud claims and expressed as much to the ex-president - who shrugged them all off. Trump dismissed Jared Kushner's concerns about Rudy Giuliani's election fraud claims, the January 6 committee revealed in its second of six hearings on Monday. The Democrat-led panel opened the hearing with videotaped depositions of Trump's advisers claiming he declared a premature victory on election night 2020 on the advise of a drunk Giuliani.The panel played audio of its investigators asking Kushner, for instance, what he said about the former New York City mayor's claims that Dominion Voting Systems was part of a vast conspiracy to rig its voting machines against Trump.'Uh, basically, not the approach I would take if I was you,' Kushner said he told his father-in-law.Trump insisted 'I have confidence in Rudy,' Kushner claimed.",

'This is a follow-up to Russian collusion, Ukrainian conversation - the millions of hours they’ve spent trying to find a crime on Donald Trump and can’t do it.''They started this frame about five years ago. It’s the same cast of characters - Bennie Thompson, and shifty [Adam] Schiff, you see [Eric] Swalwell, not on the committee, but in the background.'He went on to say that the committee's Vice Chair Liz Cheney was 'hysterical' and had 'gone off the deep end' - though he appeared to confuse her momentarily with sister Mary Cheney.  Cheney said during her opening statement that Trump 'rejected the advice of his campaign experts on election night' in favor of advice from 'an apparently inebriated Rudy Giuliani' who told him to declare victory that night and insist the vote count be stopped 'to falsely claim everything was fraudulent.' Giuliani denied the assertion that he was drunk through his lawyer - despite multiple former Trump advisers being shown to have made the claim.'Giuliani denies all falsehoods by the angry and misguided Ms Cheney,' his attorney told CNN. During Bannon's podcast Giuliani called lawmakers on the committee 'criminals' and claimed they were simply trying to 'frame Trump for something he didn't do.'Newly-revealed video shows multiple Trump advisers were concerned about the veracity of the former mayor's election fraud claims and expressed as much to the ex-president - who shrugged them all off. Trump dismissed Jared Kushner's concerns about Rudy Giuliani's election fraud claims, the January 6 committee revealed in its second of six hearings on Monday. The Democrat-led panel opened the hearing with videotaped depositions of Trump's advisers claiming he declared a premature victory on election night 2020 on the advise of a drunk Giuliani.The panel played audio of its investigators asking Kushner, for instance, what he said about the former New York City mayor's claims that Dominion Voting Systems was part of a vast conspiracy to rig its voting machines against Trump.'Uh, basically, not the approach I would take if I was you,' Kushner said he told his father-in-law.Trump insisted 'I have confidence in Rudy,' Kushner claimed.Advisers' testimonies indicate that it was apparent within hours on election night that the vote count would take several days.",
