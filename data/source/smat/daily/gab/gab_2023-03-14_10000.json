            "description": "We are living in the last days (or are we?) and you will want to join this group (especially if you're a Christian) if you want news that is relevant to Biblical Christianity.  Revelation 13 speaks of a global government (all power will be given to the beast), a global religion (all people will worship the beast), and a global money system (no one can buy or sell without the mark of the beast).\r\n\r\nWe learn facts and try to put things together.  Facts are dots and we try to connect the dots.  This is a large part of what this group is about.  Hopefully there will be discussions and you will join in.  Hopefully we will all learn.\r\n\r\nWith that, I leave you with what one person (not me) claims to be true.  I will share things from his writings.  For example, he wrote:\r\n\r\nAs we all know, ultimately the forces that assault humanity are spiritual. I will reveal a lot about this in the coming months.\r\n\r\n✔︎ How the heads of media and entertainment regularly attend gatherings where they receive direct instructions from spiritual entities, that are being channeled by mediums. These demonic spirits directly instruct Hollywood, and the media industry. You will hear this straight from top Hollywood insiders!\r\n\r\n✔︎ How the United Nations openly promotes the Lucis Trust, which was originally called the Lucifer Trust. This is a satanic organization that channels spiritual \"Masters\" to provide spiritual mantras and prayers to world leaders. These prayers are meant to create the right spiritual atmosphere on earth for the manifestation of a World Teacher.\r\n\r\n✔︎ How several insiders of the satanic elites wrote me personal letters, or told me in personal conversations, that the highest level of the world rulers are not human, but are beings from other dimensions. They are called \"The Absolute Rulers\", gather three times a year in Davos, and are the ones who truly control the WEF, UN, WHO, BIS, IMF, etc. This is confirmed by several insiders who don't know each other, and all related the exact same information to me.\r\n\r\n✔︎ How a religion called \"Luciferianism\" is the preferred spiritual practice of those who operate at the top levels of the cabal. It is this dark spirituality that inspires them to commit the horrendous acts of organizing wars, pandemics, famines, poisoning of air, soil, and water, child trafficking, transgenderism, force injecting humanity with toxic substances, and much more.\r\n\r\n✔︎ How the ancient horrors of human sacrifice (especially children) are still daily practice of these elites. The demonic entities are dependent on human sacrifice because without it, they lose their energy. That's why they demand it. When humanity would put a permanent on any and all child trafficking, these demons would simply crumble.\r\n\r\n✔︎ And so much more.\r\n\r\nAmong the thousands of organizations who oppose world tyranny there is only a handful who have the courage to talk about this.\r\n\r\nSome more of the topics that are covered here:\r\n\r\nGlobal establishment and how they have established a criminal enterprise in the US and other countries\r\nUnited Nations and World Economic Forum\r\nNational news media manipulation and thought control\r\nVirus injections\r\nBiolabs\r\nRussia-Ukraine\r\nDemocrat deception\r\nDemocrat bills and laws\r\nAbortion\r\nMass vote fraud\r\nMass censorship\r\nSecond amendment\r\nReligious freedom\r\nHal Lindsey\r\nRevelation\r\nSurvival",

We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

            "description_html": "<p>WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they&#39;re Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov&#39;t education. Let&#39;s examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We&#39;ve shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it&#39;s an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. &quot;Antarctic Treaty&quot; prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We&#39;re at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you&#39;re no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.<\/p>",
