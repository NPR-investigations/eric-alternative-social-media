            "description": "This group is to be used to form a new caucus called the True Republican United Maga Party (TRUMP) within all current political parties, as a sort of party within a party, acting as leaven: \"Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.\" (Matthew 13:33.) A caucus is \"a closed meeting of a group of persons belonging to the same political party or faction usually to select candidates or to decide on policy;\" also, \"a group of people united to promote an agreed-upon cause.\" Creating TRUMP caucuses would by-pass the legalities, expense and time needed to create a third party. It would be the fastest, most effective (since it would penetrate all parties) and least expensive way to compete against and defeat the traitorous Rinos of the Republican Party and the treasonous Democrats of the Democratic Party, which together comprise that diabolical conglomerate known as the Socially Woke American Marxist Party (SWAMP). Those who voted for Trump (Trumpers) can register with the political party of their choice, but to join these caucuses and become a card-carrying TRUMPer, they would need to fill out yet another registration form and agree to whatever the TRUMP platform is. By uniting people, talents and resources under one newly-created, common, political banner (TRUMP), both money and people will be siphoned off of the SWAMP---thus draining it---which would, in particular, completely gut and financially destroy the SWAMP Rinos. Once established as local, state and national TRUMPs, each TRUMP would have ELECTION INTEGRITY as its first and most important party platform principle, for without election integrity, all voting is in vain. (As a platform principle, TRUMPers would NOT vote in areas where there is no election integrity.) In every area where election integrity is established, TRUMP candidates would be put on the ballot. If any TRUMP really wants to effect radical and rapid change, then in every area where there is no election integrity it could establish the \"no taxation without representation\" principle as part of its platform and promote and support TAX REVOLTS until election integrity has been established. These and all other platform principles would be decided by the TRUMPers themselves, as they organize themselves around America First Trumpism, defining it as they see fit. If this is something you'd like to see happen, freely join this group and help to organize caucus committees throughout the land and establish this as, essentially, a 70 to 100 million strong third party that the governing elite will have to deal with.",

Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed.

          "content": "12/1/22 The Daily Skirmish - The Unsolved Riddle of HomelessnessLinks at http://www.liberato.us/the-daily-skirmish.htmlNew York City Mayor Eric Adams announced he is instituting involuntary hospitalization for homeless people deemed to be mentally ill and in crisis.  It’s déjà vu all over again.  Emptying the mental hospitals is arguably what created the homeless problem in the first place.  The thinking at the time was that civil liberties are paramount - homeless people aren’t criminals and you can’t keep them locked up in psych wards.  The counter-argument is that people who are not in their right mind can’t fend for themselves and create social problems when left to their own devices on the streets.  Involuntary hospitalization is more humane than what is occurring now.  The mentally ill now make up about a third of the homeless population in the United States.  I’ve seen all kinds of solutions to homelessness tried over the last 40 years, but nobody has solved the riddle.  The ideas have ranged from the intriguing to the truly insane.  Washington, D.C. opened city homeless shelters with a capped number of beds back in the 1980s.  I asked a D.C. government official at the time if this was rationing and he dissembled.  Fast forward to today and you find big homeless encampments in D.C. downtown parks and across from Union Station, so the homeless shelter approach clearly didn’t solve the problem.  As for encampments elsewhere, some areas allow camping anywhere as a point of pride, while others confine encampments to designated areas.  The worst idea of this lot is to allow the homeless to camp in your front yard with impunity, as in Illinois after the first of the year, but homeowners fled Portland after it was allowed there.  Democrat-controlled San Francisco passed a new tax in 2018 to end homelessness for all time.  Spending on the homeless is up 400 percent but there are more homeless than ever in San Francisco and the conditions in which they live are deteriorating.  Rat-infested hotels - that’s the solution the Democrats came up with.  The police no longer respond to calls about stolen packages, break-ins, and other problems caused by the homeless.Another idea is to provide free permanent housing for the homeless, but the result in Los Angeles was one-bedroom apartments costing $700,000 apiece and corruption.  Meanwhile, the number of homeless people on the street is up 41 percent.  The idea also doesn’t seem to be working in Washington, D.C. where the city is placing homeless people in upscale apartment buildings.  It only takes one homeless person to create chaos and ruin an entire building, I heard one landlord say.Another idea is to connect the homeless to lots of social services, like drug treatment and job training.  But the most intriguing idea I’ve heard comes from philanthropists who created an entire village, I forget where, in which the homeless can find their dignity by having a role to play in a real community.  But none of these ideas address mental illness, which is one-third of the problem.  Critics are already pounding away at New York City’s new involuntary hospitalization policy, but the city defends it, saying it will connect mentally ill homeless people with the psychiatric treatment they need.  Some critics say the city doesn’t have enough crisis centers or other capacity to deliver the mental health services required.  But involuntary hospitalization is only one new policy taking effect.  The city is also going the permanent housing route by cracking down on landlords who refuse to take homeless people with government housing vouchers.So there doesn’t seem to be a silver bullet that will solve the problem in all cases.  I haven’t heard the idea expressed yet that all the approaches have some merit, that triage should occur and a custom solution built for each homeless individual.  I also haven’t heard anything about family and friends being brought into the process.  Government isn’t the answer to everything.",
