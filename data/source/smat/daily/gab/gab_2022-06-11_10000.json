            "description": "WATCH: Trump-Endorsed AZ Secretary of State Candidate Mark Finchem Vows To Immediately End Participation In Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) During Debate\n\nThe Arizona GOP hosted its first-ever primary debate series moderated by AZGOP Chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward and sponsored by Turning Point Action on Thursday night.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit reported on the Arizona Secretary of State debate between State Representative Shawnna Bolick and Trump-Endorsed State Representative Mark Finchem.\n\nLast night, Mark Finchem announced that Arizona will join Lousiana in ending the State’s participation in the corrupt ERIC voter roll system when he has the rulemaking authority of the Secretary of State.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit has reported extensively on the ERIC system that is used nationwide, running a left-wing voter registration drive disguised as voter roll clean-up.\n\nIn January, Louisiana announced that they would no longer use the ERIC voter roll “clean-up” system.\n\nFinchem previously called on the Arizona Legislature to likewise ban the use of ERIC in Arizona, but the bill wasn’t even given a hearing, he says.\n\nEvery state needs to follow the lead of Louisiana and terminate the ERIC system. Mark Finchem plans to do this exactly.\n\nWard: What is the first thing you plan to accomplish when you become the Secretary of State?\n\nFinchem: Get us out of ERIC. ERIC is the Electronic Registration Information Center set up by George Soros and his crew that originally in concept was designed to help states identify individuals who were moving from one state to another. Through voter registration, through vehicle registration. When you had deceased voters, they were supposed to be in the system so that they couldn’t somehow be reassigned to another state. Well, that’s not how it turned out. ERIC, once the state joins, keeps your information. They shut down because you have to sign a contract; they shut down your access to our voter information. That is unacceptable. So, the first thing that we’ll do, in fact, I ran a bill earlier this year that would mandate that we remove ourselves from ERIC. Unfortunately, that bill wasn’t heard. So that would have to be something that the Secretary of State will have to do. A trustworthy Secretary of State will do that under rulemaking authority. Under the authority vested in that office to not sign or to sign a contract for service. ERIC has proven highly ineffective. In fact, Louisiana has pulled out of ERIC, and a number of other states are already contemplating that because of what they found out about the way that data was handled and who actually had access to that data. The second thing I’ll do is make sure that we restore the system service. Right now, the Secretary of State’s office serves party, not people. But that’s an outcome of the person who’s occupying that seat, Katie Hobbs. We’ll be glad to see her move on. That’s the first two things that I would do.\n\nMark Finchem will abolish this system in Arizona when Radical Soros-funded election fraudster Katie Hobbs moves on. \n\nhttps://rumble.com/embed/v15d4fg/?pub=4\n\nFollow and Share👉🏻@thegatewaypundit_news",

NYC has a population of 8,177,000, so that’s about $12,300 in spending for every man, woman and child.  NYC has about 3,200,000 households, so that’s $31,500 per household.  NYC has about the same number of employed workers, so that’s about $31,500 per each salary earner.  It’s funny that those two numbers match.  There are a lot of two income families in NYC, so I’m guessing the number of working couples matches the number of welfare dependent families.Regardless, the citizens of NYC couldn’t possibly carry this tax load, so most of the city’s revenue comes from corporate taxes.  NYC is a global financial capital.  These corporations aren’t like your grandfather’s old-fashioned corporation that actually produced goods and services.  These new corporations produce financial products, sometimes known as scams, or they live off crony capitalist scams like green energy.In other words, NYC’s Liberal Democratic establishment lives off the globalist (formerly known as Imperialist) exploitation of common working people around the world.https://nypost.com/2022/06/10/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-council-agree-on-record-101b-budget/",

Each of you have done many crazy things in the name of love, have you not? Things which you ordinarily would find completely illogical. You will jump at the chance to perform if there is some love at the end of that experience. So I will tell you that there is a great deal of love at the end of this ascension experience. And let this be the carrot at the end of the stick for some of you. You have been seeking this experience intensely. There is so much love that is waiting to surround you. There is so much that it is an experience of bliss. I would say that bliss is the experience of having too much love. In your third dimensional reality, you probably cannot conceive of having too much love. But it is possible and you will experience it. Perhaps you will even ask us to turn down the juice a little bit, believe it or not. For love can be very explosive. It can be very expanding. It has a tendency to melt the boundaries of your limited identity to the point where you feel a oneness or merging with all of creation. And you will all experience this.

Welcome to the weekend from the “Colonel’s Foxhole” in The Woodlands, TX — 11 June 2022!Today’s Message is: “Meant to Be Day!”  Why Not?“There are many types of great and influential leaders in the world, from yesterday’s past to the present! Many leaders learn from those throughout history, and there will be great new leaders in the future! The key question is how does one become the leader ‘He or She’ wants to be? Understand this: It’s up to each ‘Leader’ to seriously assess what type of leader they are meant to be! First, gain awareness on how to be ‘present and in the moment’ around others one leads. Second, determine the ‘unknowns’ that are holding one back from writing a unique and inspiring leadership story! Each leader must repeatedly plan and pave the way for success, understand one’s unique strengths, repair one’s weaknesses, and become a better version of themselves. Have you become the leader you were meant to be?” — COL (Ret) Mikel BurroughsThe Quote in the Picture Today Reads:“Never force anything.  Just let it be.  If it’s meant to be, it will be.” — AnonymousMore Awesome Quotes for Today’s Message:“Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be.” — George Sheehan“When we think of meant to be, we automatically assume forever.  But maybe it isn’t supposed to last forever.  Maybe it’s just someone who is in your life to teach you something.  Maybe the forever is not the person, but what we gain from them.” — Unknown Author“Getting lost along your path is a part of finding the path you are meant to be on.” — Robin Sharma“If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be, no matter how long it takes.” — Unknown Author“Rise up and become the person you were meant to be.” — Dieter F.
