          "contentraw": "Some media reported that Mr. James posted insulting statements about blacks. He implied New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a black former police captain, was “a carbon copy of the person who made you a slave.” Also, he is annoyed that black Supreme Court Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson is married to a white man. Mr. James was unhappy with blacks whom he thought were not militant or paranoid enough. He predicted doomsday, or genocide of blacks at the hands of whites. Even the war in Ukraine was a warning to blacks: “Ultimately, at the end of the day, they kill and commit genocide against each other. What do you think they gonna to do your black ass?”",

In other words, in order for you to hear from The Lord properly, you need to go through him ONLY.Since groups are public settings, therefore who knows who sees what, sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included. No one is perfect and there is no one righteous...AT ALL (Isaiah 64:6, John 8:7, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 3:21-26, 1 John 1:8-10). As long as a person is able to identify from the heart with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus...ONLY...that person is justified (Galatians 2:20, Romans 5:10, Romans 6:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17). Anything above and beyond that is merely some human attempting to push some “religion”, or “sin management”, or “man-plan”.

In other words, in order for you to hear from The Lord properly, you need to go through him ONLY.<br /><br />Since groups are public settings, therefore who knows who sees what, sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included.

For Eric Streeval, a tranquil motorcycle ride in Hickman County, Tennessee, on a clear Sunday afternoon turned into a tense rescue operation after he witnessed a woman in a convenience store hand-signaling for help.Streeval had stepped into the Twice Daily Gas Station to grab a drink on April 10 “a little after 1 p.m.,” he told The Epoch Times, when he saw a woman at the end of the candy aisle mouthing the word, “Help,” while using a hand signal devised to alert others that the signaler is being kidnapped.Streeval said the woman learned the method from TikTok.Streeval got his drink and as he paid for it at the counter, he notified the cashiers.“I told them, ‘Get the cops here. There’s a young woman in the back in the red and white striped shirt who’s possibly being abused,’” Streeval said.The woman had a red handprint on the side of her face, Streeval said.Streeval went outside to take pictures of the license plate and the truck while the cashiers attempted to stall the suspect.“The cashiers did an outstanding job of holding him up,” Streeval said.When they emerged from the gas station, Streeval said he confronted the suspect after having called 911.“I said, ‘Hey man, do you think hitting women is OK because we don’t do that around here. If you want to fight, fight a man. Don’t beat up on a woman,’” Streeval said.The suspect, whom the Hickman County Sheriff’s Department confirmed to The Epoch Times was 31-year-old Johnathon Smith, didn’t respond to Streeval’s attempts to stall him from leaving before the sheriff’s department could arrive, Streeval said.“I’m a believer in 2nd Amendment rights, so I was prepared if he tried anything just for everyone’s safety, but he just stuck his head down and got in the truck,” Streeval said.By the time the Smith was pulling out, the sheriff’s department arrived, leading to a car chase, Streeval said.",

There’s a young woman in the back in the red and white striped shirt who’s possibly being abused,’” Streeval said.<br /><br />The woman had a red handprint on the side of her face, Streeval said.<br /><br />Streeval went outside to take pictures of the license plate and the truck while the cashiers attempted to stall the suspect.<br /><br />“The cashiers did an outstanding job of holding him up,” Streeval said.<br /><br />When they emerged from the gas station, Streeval said he confronted the suspect after having called 911.<br /><br />“I said, ‘Hey man, do you think hitting women is OK because we don’t do that around here. If you want to fight, fight a man. Don’t beat up on a woman,’” Streeval said.<br /><br />The suspect, whom the Hickman County Sheriff’s Department confirmed to The Epoch Times was 31-year-old Johnathon Smith, didn’t respond to Streeval’s attempts to stall him from leaving before the sheriff’s department could arrive, Streeval said.<br /><br />“I’m a believer in 2nd Amendment rights, so I was prepared if he tried anything just for everyone’s safety, but he just stuck his head down and got in the truck,” Streeval said.<br /><br />By the time the Smith was pulling out, the sheriff’s department arrived, leading to a car chase, Streeval said.",

You can never be less. Oh, you may identify yourself as less, and thus project that awareness into your life experience. You may go along in all your affairs seeing less and manifesting less. As the poet says, many persons die with all their music in them. But you can never be less than your “I AM-age,\" for you were created with your very own divine potentiality and the power to fulfill it in a prosperous and successful life experience.\"<br /><br />~ Eric Butterworth",
