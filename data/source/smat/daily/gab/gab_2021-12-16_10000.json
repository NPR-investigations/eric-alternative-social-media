Congress, like the courts, has subpoena power. <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/was-the-house-right-to-hold-eric-holder-in-contempt/eric-holder-is-defying-the-law-by-resisting-subpoena\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>usnews.com/debate-club/was-the-house-right-to<span class=\"invisible\">-hold-eric-holder-in-contempt/eric-holder-is-defying-the-law-by-resisting-subpoena<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

It is central to Islam.<br />France‚Äôs interior minister announced on Tuesday that he had begun the process of shuttering a mosque where sermons promoting antisemitism, anti-Christian hatred and homophobia are frequently preached, he claimed.<br />In an extensive interview with French broadcaster C News, G√©rald Darmanin said that the mosque in Beauvais, a town of 50,000 about 60 miles north of Paris, would be closed down because of the ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù sermons.<br />Under French law, the Bilal mosque in Beauvais now has 10 days to appeal Darmanin‚Äôs order that it be placed under administrative closure for six months.  The interior minister‚Äôs move came as campaigning for France‚Äôs presidential election next year shifted into higher gear. With immigration and French identity crystallizing as key issues in the campaign, the field already includes two far-right candidates ‚Äî Marine Le Pen of the National Rally (RN) and independent candidate Eric Zemmour ‚Äî who have pledged to crack down on radicalism among France‚Äôs Muslim population of more than five million.<br />Since 2013, there have been 293 deaths resulting from 50 attacks in France by Islamist terrorists, according to research conducted by Fondapol, a Paris-based think-tank.",

          "content": "Pelosi (1/2)=========During her latest tenure as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi has continually demonstrated her callous disregard for the wellbeing for the American people. By way of example, Speaker Pelosi has taken no action against Representatives who have engaged in falsification and/or fabrication of evidence. Take Representative Eric Swalwell, who on February 10, 2021, during the second Senate impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump, introduced a tweet ostensibly obtained from the Twitter Account of Jennifer Lynn Lawrence, which stated, \"It has been an honor to stand up and fight for you in our nation. We will be standing strong on January 6 in DC with you. We are bringing the Calvary, Mr. President.\" Ms. Lawrence subsequently admitted that she did post the tweet, with the word \"Calvary\" being a reference to a prayer vigil organized by churchgoers supporting Trump and not a call for military-like violence at the Capitol riot as portrayed by Rep. Swalwell. However, despite the fact that Representative Swalwell presented the United States Senate with a verified representation of Ms. Lawrence's tweet, Ms. Lawrence has indicated that she does not utilize a verified Twitter account. Such accounts are identified by a blue check mark and, according to Twitter, \"let[] people know that an account of public interest is authentic. To receive the blue badge, your account must be authentic, notable, and active.\" https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-youraccount/about-twitter-verified-accounts. Given that Representative Swalwell presented the Senate with a purportedly verified Twitter posting obtained from Ms. Lawrence's account when Ms. Lawrence does not have a verified Twitter account, it is apparent that Representative Swalwell introduced evidence during the impeachment hearing that was falsified and/or fabricated. Despite the fact that Representative Swalwell blatantly engaged in the falsification and/or fabrication of evidence, Speaker Pelosi has taken no disciplinary action against him. To the contrary, Speaker Pelosi has reappointed Representative to the House Intelligence Committee, despite his intimate sexual relationship with Chinese spy Fang Fang, who seduced US politicians as part of her work. In another example, Speaker Pelosi has taken no disciplinary action against Representative Adam Schiff, who on December 13, 2021, presented text messages to the January 6 committee that appear to have been doctored and/or altered, thereby creating the impression in a visual presentation that he was quoting original text messages rather than fabrications.",

The family business revolves around Epstein, espionage, blackmail and big tech.<br /><br />To start off with will go into the origins of Epstein and how it appears he took over the blackmail business from other individuals.<br /><br />The incarnation of this particular blackmail ring goes all the way back to the mob during prohibition and in the 1930‚Äôs with Samuel Bronfman and Lew Rosensteil and was then utilized by the feds during hoovers reign with the FBI. Everyone knew of Hoover‚Äôs secret files that he held over people‚Äôs heads.<br /><br />Epstein is only the latest incarnation of a much older, more extensive and sophisticated operation that offers a frightening window into how deeply tied the U.S. government is to the modern-day equivalents of organized crime, making it a racket truly too big to fail.

Lowe) and used that to support the argument that ‚Äúan unconstitutionally appointed elector, like an unconstitutionally elected statute, is no elector at all.‚Äù<br /><br />Schiff had erased the final two paragraphs and the final clause of the first paragraph before substituting his own punctuation to make it look as if that was all there was to the quote. Russell Dye, spokesman for Rep. Jordan, asked, ‚ÄúIs anyone surprised that Adam Schiff is again rifling through private text messages and cherry-picking information to fit his partisan narrative and sow misinformation?‚Äù<br /><br />According to Davis‚Äô sources, Schiff never approached Jordan to discuss the text message before taking it upon himself to change it. If he had, Jordan could have made it clear to him that he had just been passing along an attorney‚Äôs summarized legal argument. In fact, Jordan is known for NOT texting much more than ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno,‚Äù certainly not detailed legal arguments, so a text like this from him wouldn‚Äôt have been believable to people who knew him. Schiff didn‚Äôt care.<br /><br />Significantly, one source said this: ‚Äú...You have to remember what was going on at the time. People were sending around these law review articles and debates left and right because we had an interest in learning the facts and getting them right. And if it‚Äôs somehow seditious in this country to debate or share a law review article on Alexander Hamilton‚Äôs view on things, that‚Äôs not really a country I want to be a part of anymore.‚Äù<br /><br />Davis‚Äô report goes into Schiff‚Äôs long history of doctoring ‚Äúevidence‚Äù and misrepresenting facts, and I highly recommend it. Laura Ingraham‚Äôs Wednesday show does this as well, with guest Mollie Hemingway, who also reviews what we‚Äôve said about why the committee is not legitimate. Recall that Schiff has been caught in lies multiple times; one major example: denying he knew the identity of the mysterious impeachment ‚Äúwhistleblower,‚Äù who turned out to be a scammer named Eric Ciaramella who had contacted Schiff‚Äôs office before even submitting his bogus complaint.\"",
