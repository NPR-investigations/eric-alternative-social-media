Nothing. No people, no computers, no phones, just an empty office.There is a new competitor in town, headed by Jay Valentine, the Director of the Fractal Technology Software Team at Omega4America. They have already signed up 12 states and several more are ready to make the jump.The Gateway Pundit has reported on the ERIC Systems in a series of articles and follow-up reports.** ERIC Part 1: Who’s “Cleaning” Our Voter Rolls? ERIC Now in 31 States** ERIC Part 2: Largest U.S. Counties Removed ZERO to TWO Ineligible Voters** ERIC Part 3: The Founding of the Nation’s Largest Voter Roll Clean-up Operation** ERIC Part 4: A Response to the Panicked Media AttacksOn Sunday Jay Valentine sent The Gateway Pundit, releasing a hint about what is in his letter to ERIC. Valentine found that states’ voter rolls were changed after the election so that illegal votes could be counted.ERIC is supposed to tell states whose names should be taken off the voter rolls, but in the largest counties, ERIC only names one or two voters and that helps the Democrats manufacture votes. Valentine points out how fractal technology is far more advanced than what the ERIC system has to offer.Valentine’s technology is capable of processing every voter roll, in every state, on multiple dates, relying on very few computers to get the job done.He can then send the requested information by phone to individuals or elected officials at the speed of the internet. ERIC cannot do this or they just refuse to do it to keep from harming Democrats who depend on expanded rolls.From The Gateway PunditOmega4America is contacting every Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State for all of the ERIC states to share their good news.This ought to scare the hell out of Democrats who rely on bloated voter rolls to win elections.Today we are listing the minimum requirement that exists with the Omega4America system compared to the current ERIC system.The list is not even close. The Omega4America system accomplishes ALL of the below listed tasks.The ERIC System does not. The ERIC system is antiquated, inefficient, and not trusted for a reason.It is time for the 50 states to bring trust back into the election system. Omega4America is the answer.Cleaning U.S. Voter Rolls – Minimum Viable Product  Every U.S. state has election rolls of registered voters.  Those rolls, under Federal law, must be maintained and cleaned regularly.  Effective cleaning is not being done.The following is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – the minimum requirement that current technology enables.  Any entity that does not offer such minimal services cannot claim to adequately clean voter rolls.Every item on this list is available today, at a modest cost, and can be brought into production, with modern compute technology, in any state in 45 days or less.Voter registration rolls should be reconciled, every 30 days, with county personal property tax rolls ensuring every address at which a registered voter resides is valid.Voter registration rolls should be snapshotted, by date, at least monthly. Every voter roll snapshot is compared with every previous snapshot and the differences preserved in a readable file for public review – with graphical and tabular representations.Every voter address should be scanned by an artificial intelligence (AI) engine to take the same address, if presented in multiple ways, and bring it into a uniform address type.Beginning 45 days before early voting, the MVP should begin daily snapshots of the voter rolls. These comparisons identify new voters added after deadlines, zip code changes or other election commission changes that inject doubt into election outcomes.Available state databases should be reconciled against the state’s voter rolls. DMV records, death records, NCOA change of address records, lists of non-citizens and any other information the state captures should be available to reconcile against the voter rolls to insure consistency.",

No people, no computers, no phones, just an empty office.<br /><br />There is a new competitor in town, headed by Jay Valentine, the Director of the Fractal Technology Software Team at Omega4America. They have already signed up 12 states and several more are ready to make the jump.<br /><br />The Gateway Pundit has reported on the ERIC Systems in a series of articles and follow-up reports.<br /><br />** ERIC Part 1: Who’s “Cleaning” Our Voter Rolls? ERIC Now in 31 States<br />** ERIC Part 2: Largest U.S. Counties Removed ZERO to TWO Ineligible Voters<br />** ERIC Part 3: The Founding of the Nation’s Largest Voter Roll Clean-up Operation<br />** ERIC Part 4: A Response to the Panicked Media Attacks<br /><br />On Sunday Jay Valentine sent The Gateway Pundit, releasing a hint about what is in his letter to ERIC. Valentine found that states’ voter rolls were changed after the election so that illegal votes could be counted.<br /><br />ERIC is supposed to tell states whose names should be taken off the voter rolls, but in the largest counties, ERIC only names one or two voters and that helps the Democrats manufacture votes. Valentine points out how fractal technology is far more advanced than what the ERIC system has to offer.<br /><br />Valentine’s technology is capable of processing every voter roll, in every state, on multiple dates, relying on very few computers to get the job done.<br /><br />He can then send the requested information by phone to individuals or elected officials at the speed of the internet. ERIC cannot do this or they just refuse to do it to keep from harming Democrats who depend on expanded rolls.<br /><br />From The Gateway Pundit<br /><br />Omega4America is contacting every Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State for all of the ERIC states to share their good news.<br /><br />This ought to scare the hell out of Democrats who rely on bloated voter rolls to win elections.<br /><br />Today we are listing the minimum requirement that exists with the Omega4America system compared to the current ERIC system.<br /><br />The list is not even close. The Omega4America system accomplishes ALL of the below listed tasks.<br /><br />The ERIC System does not. The ERIC system is antiquated, inefficient, and not trusted for a reason.<br /><br />It is time for the 50 states to bring trust back into the election system. Omega4America is the answer.<br /><br />Cleaning U.S. Voter Rolls – Minimum Viable Product  <br /><br />Every U.S. state has election rolls of registered voters.  Those rolls, under Federal law, must be maintained and cleaned regularly.  Effective cleaning is not being done.<br /><br />The following is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – the minimum requirement that current technology enables.  Any entity that does not offer such minimal services cannot claim to adequately clean voter rolls.<br /><br />Every item on this list is available today, at a modest cost, and can be brought into production, with modern compute technology, in any state in 45 days or less.<br /><br />Voter registration rolls should be reconciled, every 30 days, with county personal property tax rolls ensuring every address at which a registered voter resides is valid.<br />Voter registration rolls should be snapshotted, by date, at least monthly. Every voter roll snapshot is compared with every previous snapshot and the differences preserved in a readable file for public review – with graphical and tabular representations.<br />Every voter address should be scanned by an artificial intelligence (AI) engine to take the same address, if presented in multiple ways, and bring it into a uniform address type.<br />Beginning 45 days before early voting, the MVP should begin daily snapshots of the voter rolls. These comparisons identify new voters added after deadlines, zip code changes or other election commission changes that inject doubt into election outcomes.<br />Available state databases should be reconciled against the state’s voter rolls. DMV records, death records, NCOA change of address records, lists of non-citizens and any other information the state captures should be available to reconcile against the voter rolls to insure consistency.",

Greg Abbott’s (R) program busing migrants to New York City is “hateful politics” that is “taking away the respect and dignity of people who are in need” and “just so anti-American.” And said that Abbott should talk to the mayors in the cities and governors in the states that the buses have to pass through in order to get to New York and figure out “how do we do this together?” Unbelievable!

And so the focus of his tenure going forward will be in employing “techniques to more accurately identify common criminal patterns and develop profiles of perpetrators,” Politico sums up the tactic Adams prefers.<br />While at it, Adams would also like to give “Big Brother” – a symbol of ruthless authoritarian state surveillance – an image makeover.<br />With this in mind, he accused his fellow politicians of being afraid to “embrace technology” and of instead considering technology-driven surveillance “a boogeyman” – that many will agree it is.<br />Not Adams.<br />“It blows my mind how much we have not embraced technology, and part of that is because many of our electeds are afraid. Anything technology they think, ‘Oh it’s a boogeyman. It’s Big Brother watching you’. No, Big Brother is protecting you;” Adams shared his frame of mind with Politico.

Davis, has ruled for Dominion election machines that Fox News reporting of evidence of election fraud in the last presidential election is false.  In other words, on his own authority Davis has negated the evidence.  Having disposed of the evidence by edict, he has given a go-ahead to Dominion’s law suit against Fox News for defamation.  We are witnessing the  abuse of law to enforce the official narrative of the election, a narrative disproved by evidence presented by many experts.  In other words, Davis is using his court to punish those who report news unfavorable to official narratives.  Davis’ ruling signals the end of truth and free speech in the United States. Davis’ ruling opens the door for any and all reporting that is false or objectionable to official narratives to be open to defamation suits or other claims.  For example, the insistent and widespread reporting by the print and TV media and by NPR that the Covid “vaccine” is safe and effective.  We now know that it is neither, and many died and were injured by the “vaccine.”  Will other judges permit lawsuits against the media for falsely reporting that the vaccine is safe and effective, or will they rule that the experts who have exposed the danger of the “vaccine” are defaming the pharmaceutical companies?The ruling by Judge Davis will serve either to stifle news reporting or to ensure no challenges to official narratives.Meanwhile the presstitutes proceed with their use of news as a weapon against Donald Trump and his supporters.In other words, the hatred of Trump created by the presstitutes becomes grounds for convicting him not on the evidence but on the emotions of demonRats.

Excerpt:\"Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, and his team have arrested former President Donald Trump, while some of NYC's worst criminals still roam the streets.  New Yorkers who survived the city during the pandemic remember the long months when Bragg's office became a revolving door for career criminals who hit up the streets in broad daylight and had many fearing the subways. While Bragg's office was preparing to indict Trump, he let violent reoffenders continue to wreak havoc. In August, Mayor Eric Adams revealed that the same 10 criminals made up nearly 500 crimes and that 60 percent of them were still roaming the streets at that time. Adams, who promises New Yorkers he would crack down on crime that had risen during the pandemic, criticized him, as well as State Governor Kathy Hochul. In February 2022, Bragg walked back a little on his policies, sending out a memo that made it clear to all his staff that any crime involving a firearm would be prosecuted as a felony — reversing the stance he had taken just a month before. Although crime is currently at the same rate as the same time last year, felony assault continues be heightened at 8.5 percent. Despite murder and robbery being down, 84 homicides and more than 3,500 robberies have occurred this year in the Big Apple. As Bragg's office focused on indicting Trump, these career criminals ran the streets of New York, repeatedly terrorizing citizens and wreaking havoc.",

Davis, has ruled for Dominion election machines that Fox News reporting of evidence of election fraud in the last presidential election is false.  In other words, on his own authority Davis has negated the evidence.  Having disposed of the evidence by edict, he has given a go-ahead to Dominion’s law suit against Fox News for defamation.  We are witnessing the  abuse of law to enforce the official narrative of the election, a narrative disproved by evidence presented by many experts.  In other words, Davis is using his court to punish those who report news unfavorable to official narratives.  Davis’ ruling signals the end of truth and free speech in the United States. Davis’ ruling opens the door for any and all reporting that is false or objectionable to official narratives to be open to defamation suits or other claims.  For example, the insistent and widespread reporting by the print and TV media and by NPR that the Covid “vaccine” is safe and effective.  We now know that it is neither, and many died and were injured by the “vaccine.”  Will other judges permit lawsuits against the media for falsely reporting that the vaccine is safe and effective, or will they rule that the experts who have exposed the danger of the “vaccine” are defaming the pharmaceutical companies?The ruling by Judge Davis will serve either to stifle news reporting or to ensure no challenges to official narratives.Meanwhile the presstitutes proceed with their use of news as a weapon against Donald Trump and his supporters.  Rather than explain the highly questionable indictment of Trump which has been challenged by legal experts such as Alan Dershowitz, the presstitutes provide polls that allegedly show that a plurality of the public supports the indictment of Trump. The plurality, not a majority, is reached because 80% of Democrats want to get Trump at all cost, including the law.  In other words, the hatred of Trump created by the presstitutes becomes grounds for convicting him not on the evidence but on the emotions of Democrats. This signals the end of the rule of law.

Collectively, our firm obtained over $600,000 in attorney fee awards in his favor in the meritless litigation initiated by Stormy Daniels,” Dhillon tweeted.Trump’s son Eric Trump also tweeted, “[T]he 9th Circuit just awarded Trump $121,962.56 in attorney fees from Stormy Daniels. Order just released. This in addition to the roughly $500k she already owes him.”NBC News reported in March 2022 that the 9th Circuit had ruled against Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, finding at that time she owed Trump approximately $300,000 in legal fees.In 2018, Daniels’ attorney Michael Avenatti filed a defamation suit against Trump.Avenatti and Daniels had released a sketch of a man that year, who they claimed had threatened Daniels and her daughter in 2011 if the porn star talked about Trump.“A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!” Trump tweeted in response.Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge.

The 30-year project would produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak, according to the company.In two lawsuits filed within days of the approval, environmental groups and Native American tribes said the government did not adequately consider less damaging alternatives and had wrongly assumed it did not have the power to stop ConocoPhillips from developing oil and gas resources on leases it owns.ConocoPhillips has held the leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska since 1999.

          "contentraw": "Bid to pause ConocoPhillips' Alaska Willow project fails<br /><br />April 3 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday rejected a bid by environmentalists to temporarily suspend the U.S. government’s approval of ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) multibillion-dollar oil drilling project in Alaska’s Arctic.<br /><br />U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason in Anchorage had been asked by environmental groups and a Native American community in two lawsuits filed last month for an order blocking construction on the $7 billion Willow project over concerns it would exacerbate climate change and damage pristine wildlife habitat.<br /><br />Gleason said an injunction was inappropriate because the groups wouldn't be irreparably harmed by the construction that ConocoPhillips has scheduled for this month, which includes building roads and a gravel mine.<br /><br />The judge didn't address whether the lawsuits appeared likely to succeed at later stages in the proceedings.<br /><br />A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the decision will allow the company to begin construction activities \"immediately,\" and said the project will provide \"meaningful opportunities\" for the state, its Native American communities and for domestic U.S. energy production.<br /><br />Bridget Psarianos, an attorney challenging the approval, called the planned construction schedule \"aggressive\" and said the judge's decision is \"heartbreaking.\"<br /><br />\"We will do everything we can to protect the region while the merits of our case get heard,\" Psarianos said in a statement.<br /><br />The U.S. Interior Department declined to comment.<br /><br />The Biden administration approved the project on March 13, drawing cheers from Alaskan officials and the oil industry but criticism from environmental advocates who said the development undermines President Joe Biden's highly publicized efforts to fight climate change and shift to cleaner sources of energy.<br /><br />The approvals for the project in northern Alaska give ConocoPhillips permission to construct three drill pads, 25.8 miles of gravel roads, an air strip and hundreds of miles of ice roads. The 30-year project would produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak, according to the company.<br /><br />In two lawsuits filed within days of the approval, environmental groups and Native American tribes said the government did not adequately consider less damaging alternatives and had wrongly assumed it did not have the power to stop ConocoPhillips from developing oil and gas resources on leases it owns.<br /><br />ConocoPhillips has held the leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska since 1999. Former President Donald Trump's administration first approved the project in 2020. But Gleason blocked it a year later, finding its environmental impact analysis was flawed.<br /><br />The cases are Sovereign Inupiat for Living Arctic v.

Marjorie Taylor Greene’s nearby speech was drowned out by whistles and boos.The firebrand far-right congresswoman from Georgia had previously encouraged Trump supporters to join her at Collect Pond Park, just steps away from the courthouse,  for a rally at 10:30 a.m. She arrived 5 minutes late and stayed just 10 minutes — as foes’ whistles eventually drowned her out.“We are the party of male and female!” she told the crowd of about 200 Trump supporters and a similar amount of counter-protesters. “We are the party of secured borders!”Anti-trump protesters shouted back, “Get your ass home!” “Go back to Washington!” Get the f–k out of my city!” “F–k you, Marjorie” and “New York City hates you!”Whistles helped drown out the Georgia Republicans’ speech, and she quickly returned to her white SUV.Disgraced New York Rep. George Santos (R-NY) showed up around 9:40 a.m. and appeared to initially fake a phone call when The Post asked him questions. The serial liar stayed on the scene for less than an hour but said he was there to show his support for Trump, who will make history Tuesday afternoon as the first-ever sitting or current US president to be arrested and arraigned on criminal charges, reportedly involving 34 felony counts related to alleged business fraud.“I’m not here for the cameras. I’m just here for the president of the United States who is being unfairly attacked by a DA,” the congressman said. “Where’s Mr. Biden’s indictment after two years of a laptop full of a treasure trove of crime?”Earlier in the morning, a Trump backer dared anyone to “touch” her MAGA hat in the packed, hectic scrum of supporters of the ex-president, counter-protesters, and the media around 10 a.m.NYPD cops yelled at some of the protesters to calm down as members of the opposing groups pushed and screamed their way through the crowd of hundreds.NYPD Community Affairs officers were pulling anti-Trump protesters from the pro-Trump area, returning them to the side of Collect Pond Park designated for them, trying to keep the two sides separate as they rushed to remove people the moment they heard an argument.Maverick Stow of Long Island told The Post that the police were actively discouraging protesters from being in the area.The 19-year-old real-estate agent claimed that “regular people can’t get anywhere near the sidewalk around the courthouse.“Why?! It’s public property isn’t it?” he asked.Trump has called the charges against him a “witch hunt” and urged his supporters to take the streets of New York in his defense.Pauline Braccio, 66, came from Lansdale, Pa., to support Trump, who she said is “still my president.“I think Bragg is an ass,” she said of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who convened a grand jury to consider an indictment against Trump.“Stormy Daniels has changed her story so many times,” Braccio added of the porn star at the center of the case.“If Trump did pay her to keep her mouth shut, that’s not a crime,” Braccio said, referring to the $130,000 hush-money payment made to Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election.“Hush money is not a crime. He just wanted her to stop spreading the lie that she slept with him.
