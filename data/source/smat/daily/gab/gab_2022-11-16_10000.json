Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

Tell me how you are feeling one week after the midterm elections?”Swalwell said, “Feeling very good, Nicolle. The voters clearly rejected chaos, and that’s what the Republicans ran on.

That's absurd. Getting a degree in education is one of the easiest degrees you can earn. These people aren't brilliant experts. There's an old saying: \"Those who cannot do, teach.\" That has never been truer now that we have so many purple-haired perverts teaching kids.  Even if they have a master's degree in education like Jill Biden, they're still idiots who think you can just pick your gender. You ain't no \"doctor\" Jill. And must I remind this imbecile Swalwell there are over 3 MILLION homeschooled kids in America today? Swalwell is too friggin' stupid to have any power over anyone.By the way, after covid I'm questioning ALL self-proclaimed experts. Any doctor who adhered to Fauci's advice is a quack who should have their license to practice revoked. Even I knew what Fauci was doing with covid lockdowns was a violation of even the most basic rules of quarantine. You don't quarantine the sick at home with the healthy.

I want 90% of all Americans dead too.\" The audience response is laughter. He goes on to describe airborne infection for 9 out 10 ppl who knows being dead.

[The link to the original is to same http://semesteratsea.org &amp; it too yields a Not found msg.] It&#39;s the conclusion by Mims that really caught my attention:&quot;Dangerous Times&quot;Let me now remove my reporter’s hat for a moment and tell you what I think. We live in dangerous times. The national security of many countries is at risk. Science has become tainted by highly publicized cases of misconduct and fraud.&quot;Must now we worry that a Pianka-worshipping former student might someday become a professional biologist or physician with access to the most deadly strains of viruses and bacteria? I believe that airborne Ebola is unlikely to threaten the world outside of Central Africa. But scientists have regenerated the 1918 Spanish flu virus that killed 50 million people. There is concern that small pox might someday return. And what other terrible plagues are waiting out there in the natural world to cross the species barrier and to which scientists will one day have access?&quot;Meanwhile, I still can’t get out of my mind the pleasant spring day in Texas when a few hundred scientists of the Texas Academy of Science gave a standing ovation for a speaker who they heard advocate for the slow and torturous death of over five billion human beings. … &quot;Have we already experienced the output from/by &quot;a Pianka-worshipping former student&quot;?? Are there still &quot;Pianka-worshipping former student[s]&quot; - or those of his fellow travelers, still in Gov/State Authoritative positions??PS Just found a 2009 video interview (at least that is when this was uploaded) of Eric Pianka by a much younger Tucker Carlson: Population Control An Interview with Professor Eric Piankahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=462Fc-sRcDoAnother item is an Oct 2004 speech by Pianka, maybe similar to the one referred to by above Minn article in 2006 (I did not watch but a short amt): 2004 Oct 21 -- Eric R. Pianka -- The Vanishing Book of Lifehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUcMyY7PSUoStarting about 54min in, he starts talking about the economy being &quot;upside down ... grow, grow, grow.&quot; He praises an economy where everyone &quot;grows their own food &amp; rides a  bicycle ... and earn what you get with your own 2 hands..&quot;..... Hhmmm.... Did he (he died this past Sept) really think that ppl who are subsistence farmers/laborers would be listening to &amp; paying his salary/honorariums/research? I don&#39;t think he&#39;s really thought that far ... or maybe he doubts others will connect those dots.At 1:06:46 he answers a question about why he &quot;makes blanket statements that all we can hope for calls is that all the people in Africa will die from AIDS&quot; by saying,&quot;I want more than just that. I want 90% of all Americans dead too.&quot; The audience response is laughter. He goes on to describe airborne infection for 9 out 10 ppl who knows being dead. The discussion continues btwn him &amp; that young woman who asked the original question. There appears to be some who are actually serious about the need to eliminate the majority of the human population...So listen to his interview disclaiming statements w/ Tucker Carlson knowing what he actually said in 2004 in this interview about eliminating population. Not everything Pianka says is foolish/wrong but I do NOT agree w/ his solution for a &quot;population bomb&quot;.",

He shared how a few months back I had preached a message about King Nebuchadnezzar and at the time he was resistant to seeing himself in light of the truth presented. But God has been working on his heart and through the struggle new desires to align his heart and life with God’s will and ways have been unfolding. He was refreshingly honest about the state of his soul, no flowery \"christianese\", no over-promising, just simple, raw and humble reality.I think anyone who is in the preach &amp; teach calling, probably struggles with wondering if all they try to bring to opportunities to speak makes a meaningful impact. It’s a profession that is not easily measured at the end of a day. It’s work that is connected to other people’s responses and the outworking of many factors that connect to other people, places and moments. So determining if you’re fruitful is harder than determining if you're faithful.It takes prayerful and persistent grit, nerve and pluck to find all that is needed before, during and after ministering the gospel.This is why encouragement is so important in life and especially in the church. Leaders are pummeled with discouragement every week. They are pressed from within and without by adversaries of all kinds.Thank you Lord for the small, but meaningful encouragements that come from grateful people who come back and say thank you.Luke‬ ‭17‬:‭11‬-‭19‬“As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem, he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria. As he entered a village there, ten men with leprosy stood at a distance, crying out, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” He looked at them and said, “Go show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed of their leprosy. One of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back to Jesus, shouting, “Praise God!” He fell to the ground at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done. This man was a Samaritan. Jesus asked, “Didn’t I heal ten men? Where are the other nine? Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?” And Jesus said to the man, “Stand up and go. Your faith has healed you.””",

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

He shared how a few months back I had preached a message about King Nebuchadnezzar and at the time he was resistant to seeing himself in light of the truth presented. But God has been working on his heart and through the struggle new desires to align his heart and life with God’s will and ways have been unfolding. He was refreshingly honest about the state of his soul, no flowery \"christianese\", no over-promising, just simple, raw and humble reality.<br /><br />I think anyone who is in the preach &amp; teach calling, probably struggles with wondering if all they try to bring to opportunities to speak makes a meaningful impact. It’s a profession that is not easily measured at the end of a day. <br />It’s work that is connected to other people’s responses and the outworking of many factors that connect to other people, places and moments. <br />So determining if you’re fruitful is harder than determining if you're faithful.<br /><br />It takes prayerful and persistent grit, nerve and pluck to find all that is needed before, during and after ministering the gospel.<br /><br />This is why encouragement is so important in life and especially in the church. Leaders are pummeled with discouragement every week. They are pressed from within and without by adversaries of all kinds.<br /><br />Thank you Lord for the small, but meaningful encouragements that come from grateful people who come back and say thank you.<br /><br />Luke‬ ‭17‬:‭11‬-‭19‬<br />“As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem, he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria. As he entered a village there, ten men with leprosy stood at a distance, crying out, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” He looked at them and said, “Go show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed of their leprosy. One of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back to Jesus, shouting, “Praise God!” He fell to the ground at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done. This man was a Samaritan. Jesus asked, “Didn’t I heal ten men? Where are the other nine? Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?” And Jesus said to the man, “Stand up and go. Your faith has healed you.””",

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

          "content": "A very poor translation, needless to say...Go to John 15:2. Many translations would word that first sentence to the effect of, “Every branch of mine that does not produce fruit, He cuts off.”Wording it that way implies some sort of works-based righteousness, unfortunately. That could make a reader say, “See? That person got saved but didn’t produce fruit. Break out the knife and get a fire going because stuff like that just WON’T do. That person OBVIOUSLY didn’t perform enough.”Both translating that verse as well as interpreting that verse that way...Wow...That’s, like, a DANGEROUSLY bad one. There are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. I can only imagine...Actually, I don’t even WANT TO imagine...how many had his or her faith get shipwrecked over reading something like THAT. That actually goes against the gospel as a whole, not to mention “to cut off” or “to take away” makes passages such as Isaiah 64:6, John 5:24, Romans 5:10, Romans 8:28-30, Ephesians 2:8-10, Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 2:13-14, Hebrews 6:4-10, Hebrews 10:14, Titus 3:4-8, Peter 1:9, 1 John 1:8-10, 1 John 2:12, etc., etc., etc. all nothing more than liars.At least a few translations out there are a LITTLE more accurate. Instead of “cuts off” they instead imply “takes away”. It goes deeper than that, however.https://biblehub.com/strongs/john/15-2.htmInstead, how it REALLY should read is how the phrase is defined in the concordance as “LIFTED UP”. A great example would be a Messianic Jew: That person’s attached to the vine so the Vinedresser lifts that branch up in order for some sunlight to hit it versus it being buried in the shadows all the time...Bolster it and help it along so as to make it more fruitful, in other words.In essence, what John 15:2 is REALLY SAYING is to this effect: “Jesus did 100% of everything as far as your salvation goes. By contrast, you can do nothing solo (John 15:5) and there’s no way you can somehow “earn” salvation so don’t even bother trying. If you do, you’re just deceiving yourself. None of that “Mosaic Law/Ten Commandments/synagogue” stuff or any of that “God’s chosen people” stuff or any of that ‘Judaism’ stuff is going to amount to a hill of beans eventually. Neither will any of that cult/other false religion junk. Salvation comes ONE WAY ONLY (see Acts 4:12). You ready? Hope so. Forever’s a long time.A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, He changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.) People aren’t robots. Forever’s a long time.",
