We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture.

            "description": "Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I’m @shooglenifty.\r\n\r\nGod is good and His mercy endures forever!\r\n***\r\nBy posting you are agreeing to our posting standards. We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

Determined to stop his high-octane lethal feud is Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen.\r\nPredictably, the inquisition starts in the city’s police headquarters. There, the veteran cop finds nailing a jelly to the wall far easier than stopping a merc’ on a mission.\r\nIn the predator’s cross-hairs are the most sinister but successful sinners of Liverpool’s underworld. ‘Mess with the best, die like the rest’ appears to be Jack Scarlett’s maxim as after being crossed in love and trust he evens the score.\r\nThe killer question is, can Detective Chief Inspector Eric Jansen stop Jack Scarlett, and does he really want to. That is for you to decide.",

And here we stand - fleeing to Christ as our only hope for salvation.\"I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.\" (Psalm 73)Here we stand, on the \"Five Solas\" of the great reformation in Christian theology - the \"Reformation.\"1. Sola Scriptura - The authoritative rule for religious knowledge, faith and practice is the Bible alone (and not the traditions of any church or other religious organization).2. Sola Gratia - We - all we descendents of Adam - are sinners by nature. In ourselves, we are dead and dying - and utterly helpless and hopeless to save ourselves. We are completely dependent on God's grace alone to save us.3. Sola Fide - By His great mercy, God is pleased to save those who have faith in the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ. The instrument of our salvation is faith alone (and not our efforts or work).4. Solus Christus - It is the work of Christ alone - His perfect life of completely fulfilling the Law of God, His atoning sacrifice of death on the Cross to pay for our sins, and His resurrection from the dead to conquer death - that is the only merit and basis for our salvation.5. Soli Deo Gloria - Our salvation is completely by and from God, and God alone receives the glory for our salvation.\"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it - the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction. for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.\" (Romans 3:19-26)The purpose of this group is to promote & elucidate reformed Christian theology, and in so doing, glorify God, encourage his people, and urge sinners to flee to Christ, our only eternal hope and comfort.",

We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

            "description": "Flat Earth on Gab. - - - WARNING - - - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

Across the country, emergencies and disasters are still being declared daily.&nbsp;<br />In New York, Governor Kathy Hochul and NYC Mayor Eric Adams announced an emergency over the monkeypox virus, granting them a wide range of authority to restrict citizen activities and collect data on ordinary Americans. The infant formula shortage, hospital staffing problems, and many other difficulties have also been labeled emergencies.&nbsp;<br />Each of these emergency declarations comes with orders that modify or create new rules for businesses and individuals; in some cases, they free up funds for those that apply. If we learned anything from COVID-19, it’s that moves like this disproportionately benefit wealthy people and corporations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Consider the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was offered by the federal government during the pandemic to help offset payroll costs during lockdowns. The funds were distributed without sufficient supervision. This led to egregious mismanagement -- an estimated 10% of the PPP money was wasted on fraudulent claims alone, and less than a quarter of the $800 million tapped for small businesses went to their designated targets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Emergency Rule Is Killing Small Businesses <a href=\"https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2022/10/emergency_rule_is_killing_small_businesses.html#.Yz7jt6ayZPM.twitter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>americanthinker.com/blog/2022/10/emergency_ru<span class=\"invisible\">le_is_killing_small_businesses.html#.Yz7jt6ayZPM.twitter<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed.

Some recent stories will show you what I mean. The use of private money to enable government election workers to conduct get-out-the-vote drives for the Democrats was heavily criticized in the 2020 election.  The use of Zuckerbucks, as they are known, has been outlawed in some states, as a result.  But elections officials in Milwaukee are back at it, using money tied to new Democrat donors and partnering with a Democrat activist group to get out the vote for Democrats this time around.  The Wisconsin Republican Party has sued.Then there’s the perennial problem of dirty voter rolls, which the Democrats resist fixing at every turn.  Federal law requires states to maintain accurate lists, but many do not.  Several counties in Minnesota have just been sued for failing to remove duplicate registrations from their rolls.  In New York, more than 3 million voters - almost one out of four - lack a driver’s license or Social Security number to prove their identity.  This results in duplicate registrations which can facilitate fraud.  Cheaters need actual extra voter records of people who don’t vote in order to cast phony ballots in their name.  So who the heck are these unidentified people and should they really be on the rolls?The Wisconsin Elections Commission told election workers they can fill in missing information to complete absentee ballots, then count them, even though state law requires the voter be contacted to cure the ballot.  This prompted a lawsuit which the Democratic National Committee is seeking to join to have the law declared voter suppression.  That’s a head scratcher.  Why would the Democrats want to count incomplete absentee ballots that could well be fraudulent?More Democrat funny business with absentee ballots took place in New Hampshire where the state Democratic Party was mailing out absentee ballot applications to 39 towns.  The applications inaccurately claimed the voters had requested them and the return addresses were either wrong or were for entities that didn’t even exist.  Voters were being disenfranchised and the state Attorney General ordered the Democratic Party to cease and desist.  Then there’s outright fraud.  A former Democrat congressman in Pennsylvania was sentenced to 30 months for orchestrating schemes to stuff ballot boxes for Democrat candidates for several years.  He admitted to bribing a Democrat elections official to add votes to Democrat candidate totals.  Four people in North Carolina pled guilty for their role in absentee ballot fraud in the 2016 and 2018 elections.  The scheme involved collecting blank or incomplete absentee ballots, filling in candidate choices, and forging the voter’s signature.  More cases are pending.  A federal judge upheld Georgia’s new election integrity laws, including voter ID and citizenship checks.  Stacey Abrams had been going around for years claiming Georgia’s laws are voter suppression.  The judge disagreed.  The case is also notable because here we have yet another court upholding voter ID, which is only common sense and another head-scratcher as to why the Democrats would oppose it.  You gotta ask yourself why the Democrats keep trying to do away with voter ID.  They used to say they want everyone to vote, but that’s so absurd you haven’t heard that line out of them for awhile.  A citizens group in Michigan sent the Democrat City Clerk in Flint a letter demanding she comply with a state law requiring party parity in the number of election inspectors.  Flint has 92 percent Democrat inspectors and only 6 percent Republican.  The City Clerk resigned rather than comply with the law.  The same group filed a complaint to get the state out of ERIC, a supposed multistate voter roll maintenance operation which is actually a thinly disguised get-out-the-vote drive for Democrats.  The state turns over confidential voter information to ERIC, which may not even be legal, thus outsourcing a core government function - maintaining the voter rolls - to a black box that won’t answer questions or file annual reports which is funded by Democrat-aligned money.  Something’s wrong with this picture.  There are a thousand holes to be plugged before we can say with confidence our elections are secure.  It’s a never-ending process of whack-a-mole, especially with the Democrats hell-bent on poking new holes at every opportunity.  But we have no choice; we have to keep banging away at it.  So don’t get mad at the Democrats’ election shenanigans, get involved.",

Something’s wrong with this picture.  <br />There are a thousand holes to be plugged before we can say with confidence our elections are secure.  It’s a never-ending process of whack-a-mole, especially with the Democrats hell-bent on poking new holes at every opportunity.  But we have no choice; we have to keep banging away at it.  So don’t get mad at the Democrats’ election shenanigans, get involved.",

Requiring physicians to consider the state’s narrative when making a medical decision, is bad medicine and dangerous. Consensus in science only occurs when dissenting opinions are censored.”<br /><br />Commenting on the lawsuit, Mary Holland, president and general counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said, “California’s new law is a clear violation of the First Amendment. It’s startling that the legislature and the governor would even attempt to pass such legislation.”<br /><br />Holland added:<br /><br />“Censoring information about health never leads to health, but it certainly can and has led to medical catastrophes. I look forward to courts striking this law down.”<br /><br />The Los Angeles Times today reported that some doctors fear California’s new law “could do more harm than good.”<br /><br />“What was misinformation one day is the current scientific thinking another day,”  Dr. Eric Widera, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, told LA Times.<br /><br />Liberty Justice Center, a national nonprofit law firm dedicated to protecting Americans’ constitutional rights, is representing McDonald and Barke.<br /><br />Daniel Suhr, managing attorney at the center, said, “We rely on our doctors to give us their best medical advice, yet the State of California is stopping doctors from doing just that. That’s not just wrong, it’s unconstitutional.”<br /><br />He added, “Doctors enjoy the same free speech rights as other Americans. The State of California cannot define a so-called scientific consensus on an issue and then punish anyone who dares challenge it.”<br /><br /><a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/federal-lawsuit-california-punish-physicians-covid-misinformation/?utm_source=salsa&amp;eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=345649a5-ea65-4d41-8b61-9dc7b271dd4e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/federal-l<span class=\"invisible\">awsuit-california-punish-physicians-covid-misinformation/?utm_source=salsa&amp;eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=345649a5-ea65-4d41-8b61-9dc7b271dd4e<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

The 51-year-old Yu was arrested in Michigan, and the LA district attorney’s office seized numerous pieces of physical and “digital” evidence, including computer hard drives.Yu had previously won a five-year contract in 2020, to the tune of $2.9 million, to track the schedules, training, payrolls, and communications of election workers in Los Angeles County. However, Yu was required to keep all of his company’s data within the United States and only allow access to citizens and permanent residents.“Security in all aspects of any election is essential so that we all have full faith in the integrity of the election process,” said District Attorney George Gascón in a statement. In another statement, L.A. County Clerk Dean Logan said that “with the mid-term General Election 35 days away, our focus remains on ensuring the administration of this election is not disrupted.”Gascon’s office is currently seeking Yu’s extradition from Michigan to California to face trial. The DA’s office said that the information stolen by Yu included data on hundreds of poll workers, but also claimed that the stolen information did not involve voting machines or vote counts, and thus allegedly had no impact on the election results.“We are continuing to ascertain the details of what we believe to be Mr. Yu’s wrongful detention by LA County authorities,” Konnech said in a statement defending its CEO. “Any LA County poll worker data that Konnech may have possessed was provided to it by LA County, and therefore could not have been ‘stolen’ as suggested.”This bombshell development could breathe new life into theories regarding widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Although the general consensus remains that voter fraud was most likely committed by domestic actors, some have claimed that foreign adversaries such as China may have also been involved in altering the election results, shifting votes away from President Donald Trump and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.",

Requiring physicians to consider the state’s narrative when making a medical decision, is bad medicine and dangerous. Consensus in science only occurs when dissenting opinions are censored.”Commenting on the lawsuit, Mary Holland, president and general counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said, “California’s new law is a clear violation of the First Amendment. It’s startling that the legislature and the governor would even attempt to pass such legislation.”Holland added:“Censoring information about health never leads to health, but it certainly can and has led to medical catastrophes. I look forward to courts striking this law down.”The Los Angeles Times today reported that some doctors fear California’s new law “could do more harm than good.”“What was misinformation one day is the current scientific thinking another day,”  Dr. Eric Widera, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, told LA Times.Liberty Justice Center, a national nonprofit law firm dedicated to protecting Americans’ constitutional rights, is representing McDonald and Barke.Daniel Suhr, managing attorney at the center, said, “We rely on our doctors to give us their best medical advice, yet the State of California is stopping doctors from doing just that.

Con – incredibilmente – Repubblica in testa: “Energia, l’Europa in frantumi: Germania, Olanda e Austria contro gli aiuti anti-inflazione”. Forse serviva questa mossa per farglielo capire, ma meglio tardi che mai. Scrive Carlotta Scozzari: “Dopo il mancato accordo sul tetto al prezzo del gas, l’Europa trova una nuova occasione per spaccarsi. Al centro della contesa, che ha tenuto banco al consiglio Ecofin di martedì in Lussemburgo, questa volta c’è la possibilità di rispondere alla crisi energetica replicando il modello ‘Sure’ già utilizzato in pandemia. Tramite lo strumento, finanziato con emissione di debito comune, l’Unione Europea aveva messo a disposizione degli Stati membri prestiti agevolati, con l’obiettivo di sostenere le aziende alle prese con chiusure e riduzione degli orari”. Ma tra gli Stati membri – come al solito – “al posto della solidarietà si sono registrate differenze di vedute profonde”. E la tensione è cresciuta al punto che in serata, attraverso il portavoce Eric Mamer, è scesa in campo la stessa Commissione Ue per prendere le distanze: “Gli editoriali sono iniziative personali dei commissari competenti. Non impegnano la Commissione. La stessa presidente, Ursula von der Leyen, ha parlato della necessità di soluzioni europee”. Insomma, si sono sfilati. Indovinate perché? Per il solito motivo: le pressioni della Germania. Perché se qualcuno ancora non l’avesse capito, Europa vuol dire Germania. È Berlino che determina e decide come e cosa fare. Ovviamente, sempre a loro vantaggio. E se c’è da distruggere l’Italia meglio ancora. Scrive ancora Repubblica, magicamente arrabbiata contro Europa e tedeschi: “Anche questa volta, tra i più fieri oppositori, si è distinta la Germania. «Dobbiamo fare progressi sugli acquisti comuni di gas e cambiare la struttura del mercato elettrico – ha dichiarato il ministro delle Finanze, Christian Lindner – ma gli strumenti utilizzati in pandemia non possono essere trasferiti in un contesto di shock dell’offerta e di inflazione»”. Dello stesso avviso è Magnus Brunner, ministro delle Finanze austriaco: “La proposta di un nuovo Sure è l’opinione individuale di due commissari”, ha tagliato corto. E la sua omologa olandese, Sigrid Kaag, ha bollato lo schema come “non necessario”. Nel frattempo, anche l’Olanda si è mossa da sola, introducendo un tetto ai prezzi dell’energia.Ognuno va per conto suo insomma, ma per noi che non stiamo coi paraocchi e non siamo asserviti al Sistema non è una novità che ci scandalizzi. Cogliamo però con favore il fatto che ormai anche gli altri si stiano accorgendo della verità sull’Europa. Scrive ancora Repubblica: “I Paesi temono che Berlino possa mettersi in una posizione di eccessivo vantaggio competitivo rispetto agli altri” e “accusano la Germania di rompere la solidarietà europea e di fornire aiuti di Stato alle proprie imprese dando loro un indebito vantaggio competitivo”.

Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L.

Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”.

Makes one wonder at times: Human opinion versus The Lord’s opinion...Wonder who would win? Additionally - Legalism: Sad, huh?Since groups are public settings, therefore who knows who sees what, sometimes love must be tough. The desire is for everyone to hit as close to 100% as possible of everything for which The Lord created that person, self included.

As long as a person is able to identify from the heart with the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus...ONLY...that person is justified (Galatians 2:20-21, Romans 5:10, Romans 6:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17). Anything above and beyond that is merely some human attempting to push some “religion”, or “sin management”, or “man-plan”.

Google.The court will also hear a similar case in Twitter v. Taamneh.The Gonzalez case was brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old U.S. citizen who was studying abroad in Paris in 2015 when she was gunned down in an ISIS terrorist attack.Her family is seeking to sue Google, which runs YouTube, saying the company aided and abetted ISIS by allowing the terrorist group to post radical videos and recruitment tools.Although the lower court found Google not liable under Section 230, the same panel had considered the defendants — Google, Twitter and Facebook — liable in a separate action under federal anti-terrorism statutes, saying they aided and abetted international terrorism.The lawyer leading the Gonzalez family’s legal team cheered the high court’s move to hear the cases, but wouldn’t say whether it’s a sign the justices will curtail tech companies’ legal shield.“We are of course pleased that the Court took Gonzalez. What it will mean for tech companies in the future will depend on how the Court decides the cases,” attorney Eric Schnapper said.The Twitter lawsuit was brought by U.S. relatives of Nawras Alassaf, a Jordanian citizen who was shot and killed at a nightclub in Istanbul in 2017, in an attack claimed by ISIS.That lawsuit focuses on the Anti-Terrorism Act, with the plaintiffs arguing tech companies can be held liable for “aiding and abetting” ISIS by not doing more to take down its content.Neither lawsuit alleges the tech companies were directly involved in the attacks.The cases come to the justices at a time when the tech giants are under intense scrutiny for their handling of deeply divisive political debates, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election.The tech companies say they are carrying out their terms of service in curtailing the spread of disinformation and hate or violent speech.Both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have called for updating the law, though there’s little agreement so far on how to do it.States are moving ahead, however.Texas and Florida have enacted laws that would allow individuals or the state’s attorney general to sue large social media platforms for squelching a viewpoint. A federal appeals court has said the Texas law can take effect, while the Florida law has been enjoined.Litigants have already petitioned the justices to take up those cases.A key question in the Google case the justices have agreed to hear is how the algorithm is used to determine how content is promoted.Those algorithms are central to the modern concept of social media, and a ruling against Google could force major changes on the industry.“Today the income of many large interactive computer services is based on advertising,” Mr. Schnapper wrote in his brief to the justices on behalf of the Gonzalez family. “Internet firms that rely on advertising have a compelling interest in increasing the amount of time that individual users spend at their websites. The longer a user is on a website, the more advertising the user will be exposed to; that in turn will increase the revenue of the website operator.”At least four justices had to vote to take up the cases for them to reach this year’s caseload.The vote is not revealed, but Justice Clarence Thomas was likely among them. He had signaled in a 2020 statement that he was looking for “an appropriate case” to delve into Section 230.Read morehttps://liberate-america.org/2022/10/05/is-big-tech-liable-for-isis/",
