          "richcontent": "<p><strong>When I was a young boy during World War II the USA was fighting on both ends of the world - Europe, North Africa, and Pacific Ocean - to help free people from oppressive rule by dictators, despots, and devil inspired personalities such as Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, and Hirohito ... as well as to protect our own nation from outside aggression.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>We often had civil air raid practice at night where all lights were off and little mini-parachutes would fall from the sky.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>On every two or three blocks you would see a house with  a small flag denoting a relative who had been wounded or killed in battle.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>My cousin, Crawford, died in France at the age of 18. I remember seeing him at our house before he left. One of the countless young men who gave his life to help save or deliver other people in other countries.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>My brother, Eric, died in Italy at Salerno Beach after fighting in North Africa and Sicily.<\/strong> <\/p><p><strong>At Salerno Beach, Italy, my brother and his men were hemmed in by a sniper. They did not know exactly where the sniper was hidden. My brother willingly - and decisively - advanced to draw the sniper&#39;s gunfire so that his men could see from where the sniper was shooting. As a result my brother was cut in two with machine gun fire from the sniper. However, this saved his men as they could then see from where the sniper was attacking.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I have often thought that this act of gallantry was a beautiful example of what the LORD JESUS CHRIST, Messiah of Israel, did for us ... He willingly gave His life on a cruel cross stake so we could live. He paid for our sins so we could receive in exchange through FAITH His righteousness - His right standing - with our Father in Heaven.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>My brother, Eric, was engaged to a French girl from Paris named Marie Monique Bomparde. She wrote my family for seven years and did not get married to anyone until seven years after my brother died in battle; and her sister in France named her first son in remembrance of my brother.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I look now at my brother&#39;s medals as I write this and think of ONE MORE reason I will be so blessed and happy to go to Heaven: to see my brother and live with him forever ... PLUS, I get to be with the GREATEST JEW ALIVE TODAY - Yeshua (Jesus) the Son of God and the Promised Mashiach of Israel ... who willingly and decisively gave His life for me.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I trust you will reflect on MEMORIAL DAY this year, whatever country you live in or nationality you belong to, and remember that you are in a spiritual war that has already been won by the BLOOD of your Leader, Jesus the Messiah.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>_______________________________<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>“It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died.<\/strong><br /><strong>Rather we should thank God that such men lived.”<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>-- General George Patton<\/strong><br /><strong>_______________________________<\/strong><\/p>"

PART 1. \n\nIsrael was intentionally chosen as the state for the world to emulate regarding the vax:\n\nIsrael was chosen by Albert Bourla to be the vaccination center for the Covid-19 'vaccine', CEO of Pfizer admits that Israel was chosen as an ideal place to demonstrate to the world what a mass vaccination campaign can achieve and that both Israel and Pfizer worked very close together to make that happen. In Bourla's own world: \n\n1:06-1:21\n\n''During my discussions with the Israeli government, Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu convinced me that Israel would be the ideal place to demonstrate to the world what a fast vaccination campaign can achieve''\n2:19-2:31\n\n'Israel should be proud of being the leader nation in the world, in the fight against COVID and Pfizer is very proud for our contributions to your achievements'' \n\nhttps://files.catbox.moe/ajd74q.mp4 \n\nIt's also important to note that Pfizer CEO being jewish and that Israel being a jewish state was the deciding factor for this collaboration.\n\n''Israel signs COVID vaccine deal days after Netanyahu noted how Pfizer CEO is ‘proud’ of his Jewish heritage''\n\nhttps://archive.ph/s6mDI\n\nAs initially planned by Israel and Pfizer, it did not take long before Israel was marketed to the world as being; \n\n''The global leader in COVID-19 vaccine administration per capita''\n\nhttps://archive.ph/0K3xa\n\nJust as intended.\n\nIn other words, A jew CEO for a jewish company that in turn is working together with a jew country to sell to the world a poisonous jewish created injection as \"safe and effective''. Conflict of interest anyone?\n\nSetting up Israel as a leader in the world when it came to the vaccination campaign helped to set Israel as a credible source when it came to how ''successful'' the vaccine was.  Thus, at the very beginning (and continuing on from there) of the vaccination campaign, you had fraudulent studies coming from Israel that was used to sell to the world that the vaccine was ''safe and effective'' and that the rest of the world should emulate Israel. \n\nNext part, we will be looking into these studies and the fraudulence surrounding these studies; \n\nPART 2: https://gab.com/Muhareb1/posts/108387183919914809'",

PART 1: https://gab.com/Muhareb1/posts/108386671090455380The initial claim that the Covid-19 vaccine was 95% effective came first from an Israeli study that was made in collaboration with Pfizer. Here's the timeline;It started with a 'leaked report' that shows that Pfizer's vaccine is conquering covid-19 in its largest real-world test; Quote from an article titled 'A leaked report shows Pfizer’s vaccine is conquering covid-19 in its largest real-world test' that was published February 2021; ''Its lead authors are Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health for Israel’s health ministry, and Eric Haas, a ministry researcher. In addition, the study was carried out by a team of eight Pfizer researchers, including epidemiologists Farid Khan and John McLaughlin and the company’s global medical lead for covid vaccines, David Swerdlow, an infectious disease expert previously with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The research represents the first joint report by the health ministry and Pfizer since they reached an agreement earlier this year for Israel to share vaccination data in return for a steady supply of doses''.https://archive.ph/jLYzrLet's have a closer look at who was behind this study;https://files.catbox.moe/19eyhq.pngLet's take a look at what positions they hold;https://files.catbox.moe/abj9qn.pngThese are high-level prominent Pfizer employees, who had a role in developing the 'vaccine'.
