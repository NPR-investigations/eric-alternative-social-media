To get the world you want, you have to eliminate anyone with the knowledge of the past. Well, here's a hint for you: give up. It won't work, it will boomerang back on you and you'll be coming up against people that aren't who you think they are. It won't be pleasant. So take your insults and threats and hit the road.",

While it’s fashionable in some circles to whitewash the history of communism, Florida will stand for truth and remain as a beachhead for freedom.”The bill orders all public schools in the state to observe the holiday every year, and also mandates that all high school students take a U.S. government class that will dedicate at least 45 minutes of instruction focusing on the holiday and its meaning, starting in the 2023-2024 academic year.The classes in question must focus on multiple Communist figures, regimes, and atrocities, including “Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet System, Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution, Vladimir Lenin and the Russian Revolution, Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge, and Nicolás Maduro and the Chavismo movement,” among others.DeSantis used the signing of the bill to further criticize the glorification of Communism and other far-left ideologies by the modern American LeftClick on any of the above text to see his profile",

So, as our genius elected officials promote this nonsense, not only are we being urged to buy these things and replace our reliable, cheap generating systems with expensive new windmills and solar cells, but we will also have to renovate our entire delivery system! This later \"investment\" will not be revealed until we're so far down this dead end road that it will be presented with an   'OOPS...!' and a shrug.If you want to argue with a green person over cars that are eco-friendly, just read the following. Note: If you ARE a green person, read it anyway. It's enlightening.Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, \"For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine.\" Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran  on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity.I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery. $18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery. Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 Mpg = $0.10 per mile.  The gasoline powered car costs about $25,000 while the Volt costs $46,000 plus. So the Canadian Government wants loyal Canadians not to do the math, but simply pay twice as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run, and takes three times longer to drive across the country.WAKE UP NORTH AMERICA!!!!!!!",

That said, when you see this story, it is immediately obvious on the face of it that this black just wanted to kill Asian people – presumably in revenge for perceived mistreatment by Asian convenience store owners....(Cont/)https://urlday.cc/36q6i",

Garcia said investigators found that a similar vehicle was reported to be involved in two other recent shootings, including an April 2 drive-by in the area where the salon is located. No one was injured in either of those shootings.“We are turning to every resident of the city of Dallas to keep an eye out and safeguard our city,” Garcia said. “Hate has no place here.”“We need to get this person in custody,” Garcia said.He said the vehicle was also linked to a drive-by shooting on Tuesday about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of the shopping center where Wednesday’s shooting happened.Garcia said police would be increasing patrols, and they were reaching out to other police departments in North Texas to see if there have been any similar incidents in their area. He said Dallas police have also reached out to the FBI to let them know of the possible connection.The three women who were shot at the salon were taken to a hospital with injuries that weren’t life-threatening.The daughter of one of the injured women said her mother told her that the man, whom she didn’t recognize, calmly walked in, opened fire and left.John Jun, a founding member of the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter of the Korean American Coalition, said he’d hoped that the shooting at the salon was an isolated incident.“Now we’re a little more concerned because it seems like they are targeting for sure Asian Americans and most likely Korean American businesses in the area,” Jun said.He said the salon is in the heart of Koreatown, which is in a part of the city that was transformed in the 1980s from an industrial area to a thriving district with shopping, dining, markets, medical offices and salons.“The people are obviously shaken and they are on the edge right now,” Jun said.Anti-Asian violence has risen sharply in recent years.
