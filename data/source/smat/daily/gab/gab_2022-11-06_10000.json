In 2014, back when the open hostilities in Ukraine really began, the journalist Eric Margolis said “We can stumble into a war with Russia. This reminds me of 1914 all over again.” This “stumbling” of course refers to the “sleepwalking thesis of war” that is part of both popular and scholarly narratives of World War I. The International Relations realist Stephen Walt warned “the West is sleepwalking into war in Ukraine” the day before Russia invaded. The World Health Organization (yes, that one) has warned the world could be sleepwalking into a nuclear war. And the Asia-Pacific Leadership Network is concerned the world might be “sleepwalking into nuclear Armageddon.” Unfortunately, it’s much worse than that.

          "contentraw": "Walking Wide Awake ZInto World War III<br />The Russian invasion of Ukraine, along with rising tensions between NATO and Russia, have drawn comparisons to the outbreak of World War I. In 2014, back when the open hostilities in Ukraine really began, the journalist Eric Margolis said “We can stumble into a war with Russia. This reminds me of 1914 all over again.” This “stumbling” of course refers to the “sleepwalking thesis of war” that is part of both popular and scholarly narratives of World War I. The International Relations realist Stephen Walt warned “the West is sleepwalking into war in Ukraine” the day before Russia invaded. The World Health Organization (yes, that one) has warned the world could be sleepwalking into a nuclear war. And the Asia-Pacific Leadership Network is concerned the world might be “sleepwalking into nuclear Armageddon.” Unfortunately, it’s much worse than that.

Princeton University historian Stephen Kotkin has criticized the sleepwalking thesis of war as a comforting myth that remains “close to people’s hearts” to this day. “Nobody ever sleepwalks into war,” he says.<br />by John Weeks<br /><a href=\"https://libertarianinstitute.org/articles/walking-wide-awake-into-world-war-iii\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>libertarianinstitute.org/articles/walking-wid<span class=\"invisible\">e-awake-into-world-war-iii<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

How many FBI agents has Garland <br />dispatched to capture this violent terrorist and bring her to justice?<br />The alarming motion to dismiss the indictment was summarily granted by Obama-appointed Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson who falsely signed the <br />dismissal order as an Article III U.S. District Court Judge and falsely stated it was based on reasons given by the prosecutor when in fact, no <br />reasons were offered in court.",

The oil will be delivered to the companies between December 1st and December 31st.The price of gasoline in the United States has been rising consistently throughout 2022, primarily as a result of the Biden Administration’s cancelation of all domestic energy production, including halting the sale of any further leases for drilling on federal land, in a bid to force the country towards “green energy” sources.As a result, gas prices soared to an average of over $5 a gallon nationwide, with some states reaching even higher. Prices rose even higher as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leaving the international energy market diminished while American dependence on foreign oil grew. Biden announced earlier this year that he would be releasing 180 million of the 402 million total barrels of oil hidden underground in the SPR, which is usually reserved for use in emergencies such as war or an invasion.Subsequently, the SPR is now at its lowest level since 1984, with many criticizing Biden’s actions as taking advantage of an emergency stockpile purely for political purposes, as the high gas prices caused his approval ratings to drop. But despite his attempts to lower prices with the strategic reserve, prices have nevertheless begun rising again as the 2022 midterms draw closer.",

While other countries have announced probes into the alleged police stations, the location within American Changle Association — a Chinatown community organization in New York City — continues to operate outside legal boundaries and should be shut down, experts told the DCNF.“This is a disgrace.

The Chinese government claims these operations aim to crack down on drug smuggling and telecommunications fraud.“There has been a noticeable uptick in incidents where the Chinese government is targeting people on other nations’ soil,” Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Jim Risch of Idaho, who also serves on the Senate’s intelligence committee, told the DCNF. “This shows the Chinese Communist Party is not afraid to exert its will outside of China, and we should do all that we can to counter this behavior.”China’s overseas police stations enable the CCP to illegally monitor and oppress dissidents across the globe, Conor Healy, director of government research at the video surveillance research organization IPVM, told the DCNF. “I have met many individuals who have fled China fearing for their lives, who go on to be harassed and threatened in Canada and in the U.S.,” said Healy, who provided testimony on China’s surveillance state during the 2021 Uyghur Tribunal proceedings.“These things simply should not be allowed to exist,” Healy added.",

          "content": "Democrats Don’t Actually Believe Democracy Is at Stake in the MidtermsA simple comparison of their rhetoric to their actions proves it.Having scrabbled around desperately for a sufficiently alarmist closing message, the Democratic Party and its many acolytes in the press have at long last settled upon the proposition that if voters wish to preserve American democracy going forward, they must usher in a period of sustained one-party rule. Scribbling this week in the pages of the Washington Post, Max Boot neatly summed up the ruse: November’s elections, Boot submitted in earnest, “are actually a referendum on whether you favor the continuation of democracy in America.” If you do, he concluded, you are obliged to deliver every office in the country to the party Boot happens to prefer. Anything else is undemocratic.I shall leave it to the philosophers to unpack the many paradoxes that are contained within the extraordinary contention that if the Republicans receive more votes than the Democrats, “democracies die,” and instead note just how little those who are advancing this argument seem to believe their own spin, or to comprehend their own deleterious roles in the evil they now decry. Donald Trump’s post-election perfidy was, indeed, unique in scale. But it was not unique in type — and, as the evidence increasingly shows, Americans understand that better than the Democratic Party seems to believe. Why are voters split on the question of which party represents a “major threat” to democracy? Because, unlike the media they loathe, they are capable of remembering a world prior to January 6, 2021, and they are aware that the party now casting itself as democracy’s defender has a long and undistinguished history of casting aspersions on each and every part of America’s longstanding constitutional order.They remember that Hillary Clinton, who lost fairly to Donald Trump in 2016, has never accepted that loss: “He knows he’s an illegitimate president,” she said of Trump in 2019, before pointing to “the many varying tactics” that were supposedly used to steal the election from her — tactics that, per Clinton, included “hacking.” They remember that her language was echoed by figures such as Jimmy Carter, who has averred that Donald Trump “lost the election” and that “Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016.” They remember that the current White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, complained in 2016 about the “stolen election” and called Donald Trump “un-presidented.” They remember that Stacey Abrams has spent years pretending that she won the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race; they remember that she has been endorsed in this lie by Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Eric Holder, Sherrod Brown, and many other Democrats; and they remember that she has been rewarded for her chutzpah by being nominated for the governorship once again. Is it true, as Max Boot insists, that the midterms will feature too many candidates who “have denied or questioned the outcome of the last presidential election?” Yes, it is. But does it also matter that the people who are condemning these figures are election-deniers themselves? Of course it does. Just four years ago, Max Boot himself was insisting that “Trump is an illegitimate president whose election is tainted by fraud.” Is that how “democracies die”?Its rhetoric aside, one does not get the impression that the Democratic Party truly believes that American democracy is on the line. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would have moderated politically, culturally, and fiscally. This Democratic Party has not done so. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would have sacrificed some of its pre-existing ideological agenda so that it could meaningfully address the economic crisis that has caused its precipitous decline in the polls. This Democratic Party has not done so. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would not have consciously elevated the candidates it now casts as existential threats in the hope that they’d be easier to beat on Election Day. This Democratic Party has done just that, repeatedly. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would not have muddied its message by talking loudly about packing the Supreme Court and abolishing the Senate filibuster, and it certainly would not have allowed the Democratic president to commit a series of impeachable offenses two months before the midterm elections. This Democratic Party has done all of those things. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would have expelled Stacey Abrams from its ranks.
