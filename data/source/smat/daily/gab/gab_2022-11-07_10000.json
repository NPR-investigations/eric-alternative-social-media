            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Emergency responders safely evacuated a small handful of employees working at the Symrise chemical plant when the fire broke out at about 4am local time (9am GMT).&nbsp;  The fire sent a large plume of thick smoke into the air and, as a precaution, local emergency officials ordered neighbourhoods within a 1-mile radius of the Colonel's Island plant to evacuate.&nbsp; Residents in Hickory Bluff were asked to leave their homes for refuge centres, and other neighbourhoods and schools are under shelter-in-place orders due to the possible risk of further explosions.Glynn County Schools Police Chief Rod Ellis told local outlets that&nbsp;school buses were avoiding the Satilla Shores area.At around 7.45am local time (12.45pm GMT), Glynn County Sheriff's Office said: \"Code Red has been engaged.\"  Ms Baasen said officials were mostly concerned about hazards posed by smoke drifting into populated areas, but added there was also potential threat from explosions.She added that the fire had been contained and was expected to burn itself out.Fire Captain Eric Proswimmer, who was on the scene with fire crews from Jacksonville, Florida, sent to help battle the flames, said heat from the fire had caused three metal tanks containing chemicals to explode, prompting firefighters to back away.The emergency responder added firefighters had exhausted more than a million gallons of water stored in tanks on the site.He said: “It’s not widespread, it’s not crazy right now.

Emergency responders safely evacuated a small handful of employees working at the Symrise chemical plant when the fire broke out at about 4am local time (9am GMT).&nbsp;  <br /><br />The fire sent a large plume of thick smoke into the air and, as a precaution, local emergency officials ordered neighbourhoods within a 1-mile radius of the Colonel's Island plant to evacuate.&nbsp; <br /><br />Residents in Hickory Bluff were asked to leave their homes for refuge centres, and other neighbourhoods and schools are under shelter-in-place orders due to the possible risk of further explosions.<br /><br />Glynn County Schools Police Chief Rod Ellis told local outlets that&nbsp;school buses were avoiding the Satilla Shores area.<br /><br />At around 7.45am local time (12.45pm GMT), Glynn County Sheriff's Office said: \"Code Red has been engaged.\"  <br /><br />Ms Baasen said officials were mostly concerned about hazards posed by smoke drifting into populated areas, but added there was also potential threat from explosions.<br /><br />She added that the fire had been contained and was expected to burn itself out.<br /><br /><br />Fire Captain Eric Proswimmer, who was on the scene with fire crews from Jacksonville, Florida, sent to help battle the flames, said heat from the fire had caused three metal tanks containing chemicals to explode, prompting firefighters to back away.<br /><br />The emergency responder added firefighters had exhausted more than a million gallons of water stored in tanks on the site.<br /><br />He said: “It’s not widespread, it’s not crazy right now. But we've got chemicals that are hazardous and we are staying back from them at this time.”<br /><br />He noted that one firefighter suffering from exhaustion had been taken to a hospital, but there were no other injuries.<br /><br />The cause of the fire was not immediately known.&nbsp;<br /><br />Capt Proswimmer said an investigation would be conducted after the fire was extinguished.'  <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/us/1693359/brunswick-fire-explosion-chemical-plant-georgia-usa-dxus\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>express.co.uk/news/us/1693359/brunswick-fire-<span class=\"invisible\">explosion-chemical-plant-georgia-usa-dxus<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Their goal is an international rules based order where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State.

            "description": "\"Here I stand.\"Martin Luther's immortal words. And here we stand - fleeing to Christ as our only hope for salvation.\"I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.\" (Psalm 73)Here we stand, on the \"Five Solas\" of the great reformation in Christian theology - the \"Reformation.\"1. Sola Scriptura - The authoritative rule for religious knowledge, faith and practice is the Bible alone (and not the traditions of any church or other religious organization).2. Sola Gratia - We - all we descendents of Adam - are sinners by nature. In ourselves, we are dead and dying - and utterly helpless and hopeless to save ourselves. We are completely dependent on God's grace alone to save us.3. Sola Fide - By His great mercy, God is pleased to save those who have faith in the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ. The instrument of our salvation is faith alone (and not our efforts or work).4. Solus Christus - It is the work of Christ alone - His perfect life of completely fulfilling the Law of God, His atoning sacrifice of death on the Cross to pay for our sins, and His resurrection from the dead to conquer death - that is the only merit and basis for our salvation.5. Soli Deo Gloria - Our salvation is completely by and from God, and God alone receives the glory for our salvation.\"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it - the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction. for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.\" (Romans 3:19-26)The purpose of this group is to promote & elucidate reformed Christian theology, and in so doing, glorify God, encourage his people, and urge sinners to flee to Christ, our only eternal hope and comfort.",

Their goal is an international rules based order where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State.

Their goal is an international rules based order where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State. The GOP needs to put a man in the Oval office who unlike 1% ruling élite globalists billionaires like Trump and Biden is not afraid to out the CFR deep state by name and deed!Ron Paul talks about American power structure, FED, Trilateral Commission and CFR 1988 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDZsQQ5wRBQ CFR deep state FBI chief Chris Wray warns violent ‘domestic terrorism’ growing in USBy ERIC TUCKER and MARY CLARE JALONICKMarch 2, 2021“Jan. 6 was not an isolated event. The problem of domestic terrorism has been metas-tasizing across the country for a long time now and it’s not going away anytime soon,” Wray told lawmakers. “At the FBI, we’ve been sounding the alarm on it for a number of years now.”https://apnews.com/article/fbi-chris-wray-testify-capitol-riot-9a5539af34b15338bb5c4923907eeb67 A Conversation With CFR member Cecil Wray's son Christopher Wray at the CFR https://www.cfr.org/event/conversation-christopher-wray-0April 29, 2019 FBI Director Wray, son of Council on Foreign Relations member Cecil Wray - briefs his Council on Foreign Relations handlers on Global Threats and National SecurityFBI Director Christopher Wray talked about the agency’s role in protecting the U.S. from international threats. These threats, Director Wray said, include China’s determination to advance economically at American expense. Following these remarks, he participat-ed in a question and answer session. Topics included Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and recruitment and retention at the FBI.https://www.c-span.org/video/?460010-1/fbi-director-christopher-wray-speaks-council-foreign-relationsDeep State’s False Flags Getting Bolderby via Alex Newman @AlexNewman July 4, 2022The federal government is lying and has been lying about key incidents, including cov-ering up its role and the facts in critical events such as the Oklahoma City Bombing, The New American Senior Editor William F. Jasper told Alex Newman for this special episode of Behind The Deep State. Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nation-alists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to “kidnap” Michigan Gov. Whitmer. Jasper sug-gests that understanding these facts is foundational to understanding how the Deep State works and what may be coming.https://thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-getting-bolder/Bilderberg member POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE - I was the CIA director.

Their goal is an international rules based order where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State. <br /><br />The GOP needs to put a man in the Oval office who unlike 1% ruling élite globalists billionaires like Trump and Biden is not afraid to out the CFR deep state by name and deed!<br />Ron Paul talks about American power structure, FED, Trilateral Commission and CFR 1988 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDZsQQ5wRBQ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>youtube.com/watch?v=xDZsQQ5wRBQ<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <br /><br />CFR deep state FBI chief Chris Wray warns violent ‘domestic terrorism’ growing in US<br />By ERIC TUCKER and MARY CLARE JALONICK<br />March 2, 2021<br />“Jan. 6 was not an isolated event.

Jasper told Alex Newman for this special episode of Behind The Deep State. Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nation-alists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to “kidnap” Michigan Gov. Whitmer. Jasper sug-gests that understanding these facts is foundational to understanding how the Deep State works and what may be coming.<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-getting-bolder/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-ge<span class=\"invisible\">tting-bolder/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Bilderberg member POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE - I was the CIA director.

Their goal is an international rules based order where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State.

She was arrested and posted a $10,000 personal recognizance bond, according to the office.Bernett currently represents District 12, which includes Louisville and Lafayette in eastern Boulder County up to Longmont.But after redistricting, District 12 no longer includes Longmont, which Bernett listed as her primary residence when she was elected in 2020. Instead, the Longmont home was drawn into District 19 during redistricting.But according to the district attorney’s office, Bernett filed sworn affidavits with the Secretary of State’s Office both last year and this year declaring that her primary residence was an apartment she was renting in Louisville since last November that is within the newly drawn District 12.A resident filed a complaint with the district attorney’s office Sept. 19 alleging Bernett did not actually live there. According to the district attorney’s office, its investigators talked to witnesses and used search warrants and cell phone location information and found she did not live at the Louisville apartment that she claimed was her primary residence.Prosecutors say that since the investigation found she did not live at the Louisville address, she had signed false sworn documents with the Secretary of State’s office. They also say that because she misrepresented her residence, she voted in June’s primary in a district she does not live in.“The District Attorney’s Office has concluded a thorough investigation. I appreciate the efforts of the investigators assigned to this case, including using proper investigative tools such as the judicially authorized search warrants,” District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in a statement. “Based on the facts and the law, we will now move forward with a criminal prosecution. As in every case, our goal is to seek the right outcome — without fear or favor.”This is the second time this year a Democratic member of the General Assembly faced an investigation into whether they misrepresented their primary residence for election and voting purposes.Dougherty’s office said by the time it notified the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder’s Office of the allegations, Bernett’s name was already printed on the House District 12 ballots. Bernett won her 2020 election 74% - 26% over Republican Eric Davila. She faces Republican Anya Kirvan in the Nov. 8 election.State Sen. Pete Lee, D-Colorado Springs, saw a felony case against him dismissed after his attorney showed prosecutors unknowingly provided the grand jury in the case with false information about his residence that led to his indictment.The Secretary of State’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about more information on the allegations or what could happen after the election.Bernett is next due in court on Nov. 17.",

          "content": "Democrats Don’t Actually Believe Democracy Is at Stake in the MidtermsA simple comparison of their rhetoric to their actions proves it.Having scrabbled around desperately for a sufficiently alarmist closing message, the Democratic Party and its many acolytes in the press have at long last settled upon the proposition that if voters wish to preserve American democracy going forward, they must usher in a period of sustained one-party rule. Scribbling this week in the pages of the Washington Post, Max Boot neatly summed up the ruse: November’s elections, Boot submitted in earnest, “are actually a referendum on whether you favor the continuation of democracy in America.” If you do, he concluded, you are obliged to deliver every office in the country to the party Boot happens to prefer. Anything else is undemocratic.I shall leave it to the philosophers to unpack the many paradoxes that are contained within the extraordinary contention that if the Republicans receive more votes than the Democrats, “democracies die,” and instead note just how little those who are advancing this argument seem to believe their own spin, or to comprehend their own deleterious roles in the evil they now decry. Donald Trump’s post-election perfidy was, indeed, unique in scale. But it was not unique in type — and, as the evidence increasingly shows, Americans understand that better than the Democratic Party seems to believe. Why are voters split on the question of which party represents a “major threat” to democracy? Because, unlike the media they loathe, they are capable of remembering a world prior to January 6, 2021, and they are aware that the party now casting itself as democracy’s defender has a long and undistinguished history of casting aspersions on each and every part of America’s longstanding constitutional order.They remember that Hillary Clinton, who lost fairly to Donald Trump in 2016, has never accepted that loss: “He knows he’s an illegitimate president,” she said of Trump in 2019, before pointing to “the many varying tactics” that were supposedly used to steal the election from her — tactics that, per Clinton, included “hacking.” They remember that her language was echoed by figures such as Jimmy Carter, who has averred that Donald Trump “lost the election” and that “Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016.” They remember that the current White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, complained in 2016 about the “stolen election” and called Donald Trump “un-presidented.”They remember that Stacey Abrams has spent years pretending that she won the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race; they remember that she has been endorsed in this lie by Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Eric Holder, Sherrod Brown, and many other Democrats; and they remember that she has been rewarded for her chutzpah by being nominated for the governorship once again. Is it true, as Max Boot insists, that the midterms will feature too many candidates who “have denied or questioned the outcome of the last presidential election?”Yes, it is. But does it also matter that the people who are condemning these figures are election-deniers themselves? Of course it does. Just four years ago, Max Boot himself was insisting that “Trump is an illegitimate president whose election is tainted by fraud.” Is that how “democracies die”?Its rhetoric aside, one does not get the impression that the Democratic Party truly believes that American democracy is on the line. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would have moderated politically, culturally, and fiscally. This Democratic Party has not done so. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would have sacrificed some of its pre-existing ideological agenda so that it could meaningfully address the economic crisis that has caused its precipitous decline in the polls. This Democratic Party has not done so. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would not have consciously elevated the candidates it now casts as existential threats in the hope that they’d be easier to beat on Election Day. This Democratic Party has done just that, repeatedly. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would not have muddied its message by talking loudly about packing the Supreme Court and abolishing the Senate filibuster, and it certainly would not have allowed the Democratic president to commit a series of impeachable offenses two months before the midterm elections. This Democratic Party has done all of those things. A Democratic Party that believed that American democracy was on the line would have expelled Stacey Abrams from its ranks. This Democratic Party has not done so.https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/10/democrats-dont-actually-believe-democracy-is-at-stake-in-the-midterms/",
