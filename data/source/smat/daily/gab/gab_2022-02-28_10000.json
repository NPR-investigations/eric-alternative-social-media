A 67 ans, l'auteur de la Démosophie (https://www.demosophie.com/la-demosophie/livre-2020/) annonçait déjà dans ce livre écrit en 2006/2007 la plupart des événements qui se sont produits ces dernières années, non pas au titre de prédictions, mais par simple déduction logique.Cet Entrenôtre aura vocation à nous permettre d'échanger avec lui autour des différents moyens de défendre, face au totalitarisme et au mépris, l'intérêt que nous avons tous en comme Un : la Vie.

The subway hammer guy turns out to be black. When you attack a Jew in NYC, the authorities will pull out all stops to get you. Jew > black.\"A man, 57, has been arrested after he was accused of kicking a woman down a New York City subway station stairs and smashing her repeatedly in the head with a hammer - just days after Mayor Eric Adams vowed to crack down on violence in the transit system.William Blount was pictured as he was escorted out of Transit District 20 on Sunday after he was arrested for the hammer attack of Nina Rothschild at the Queens Plaza subway station Thursday.Blount, who was charged with attempted murder, robbery and assault, allegedly kicked the 57-year-old city health worker down the stairs and bashed her head repeatedly with a hammer at a subway station, leaving her critically wounded.Surveillance footage from outside the station in Queens Plaza, in Long Island City, showed a man, reported to be Blount, walking with a cane as he approached  Rothschild, as she carefully walked down the stairs to the subway platform on Thursday at 11:22 pm. Blount reportedly began by kicking her in the back and attempting to knock her over, but when Rothschild stays on her feet and appears to try and slowly flee, he pulls out a hammer, according to authorities.Police said he then proceeded to bash her in the head 13 times while she struggles, with the final hit knocking her over.Blount, whose last known address is in Astoria, has a half-dozen prior arrests  including charges of robbery and criminal possession of a controlled substance, then grabbed her purse and fled, according to the New York Post. He served time in the late 1980s for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance, records show.Officers found the woman lying on the ground, suffering from a fractured skull and lacerations to her head. Blount reportedly stole two cellphones, debit cards, credit cards and an unknown amount of money from Rothschild, according to police, who was taken to nearby Weill Cornell Medical in critical condition. The attack comes just one week after Adams announced his Subway Safety Plan initiative and deployed 1,000 additional officers, as well as teams of health workers, to crack down on rising crime in the subways.",
