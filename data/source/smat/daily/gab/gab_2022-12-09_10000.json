We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Heritage Foundation names radio studio after Rush, gives him Titan of Conservatism Award. Swalwell was put on House Intelligence Committee, despite no background or policy expertise. ChiCom spy Fang Fang had sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors, bundled donations for Eric Swalwell. Swalwell refuses to say if he had sex with the honeypot because it's \"classified\". Why the Swalwell story matters. Swalwell tries to defend himself on CNN, blames Trump!  The Gurgling Cod. Chinese influence. Caller wants Trump to start a news network and investigate Democrats.",

I spoke with Retired Special Agent Eric Caron about the CIA and what is known about the \"Biden Crime Family.\" China has been eating Biden’s lunch, openly courting Russia and Iran and snubbing U.S. efforts to close the massive trade gap. And Saudi Arabia all but laughed in the president’s face when he flew there to beg for oil. Why? Because Joe Biden is weak — both physically and politically. I was also joined by Randy L. Nobel to discuss the apparent murder of Mahsa Amini by the Iranian \"Morality Police\" which sparked an ongoing series of protests that have continued despite harsh crackdowns from the Iranian government.

ERIC can then take the list that produces and run Lexus/Nexus and AI to give the list a weight on who would vote liberal versus conservative or not vote at all. Then they can right scripts that can create these voter registrations and test on a test database. Then if needed on election night they can add as many as are needed by scripts.(Seems like I just read last week Arizona had a website created to do exactly that. Add registrations by scripts.)Now for the scariest part. If you add admin access to the election database. Then you can write scripts that vote for those new registrations. But that would require a pause in counting and that would be a definite indicator. Oh that is right Arizona keeps having long pauses in the counting.Not to say the other issues are not a factor. But as long as this issue exists there is the possibility to control the outcome. What makes it worse. Using this method all the data is real. Taken from the states own databases so no algorithms to show. The only way short of forensics on the voting machines to prove it is canvassing. There are a couple of other indicators.

Well I have been advising it is possible to compare the voter registration rolls against the DMV and Bureau of Vital Statistics. To find who is capable of registering but not yet registered. ERIC can then take the list that produces and run Lexus/Nexus and AI to give the list a weight on who would vote liberal versus conservative or not vote at all. Then they can right scripts that can create these voter registrations and test on a test database. Then if needed on election night they can add as many as are needed by scripts.(Seems like I just read last week Arizona had a website created to do exactly that. Add registrations by scripts.)Now for the scariest part. If you add admin access to the election database. Then you can write scripts that vote for those new registrations. But that would require a pause in counting and that would be a definite indicator. Oh that is right Arizona keeps having long pauses in the counting.Not to say the other issues are not a factor. But as long as this issue exists there is the possibility to control the outcome. What makes it worse. Using this method all the data is real. Taken from the states own databases so no algorithms to show. The only way short of forensics on the voting machines to prove it is canvassing. There are a couple of other indicators.

So many stunning revelations have been reported in the last couple days from the release of the Twitter files and the Missouri versus Biden Big Tech censorship case, there’s no room on the front page left.An FBI agent testified in a deposition in the censorship case that FBI headquarters put its “stamp of approval” on requests to social media companies to block specific information before the 2020 elections.  Requests would get routed through FBI field offices around the country, federal prosecutors, FBI and Justice Department lawyers, and FBI headquarters before being sent to the agent’s “command post” in San Francisco for action.  The agent further testified social media platforms frequently complied with FBI requests to take down posts.  A State Department official testified during his deposition that the State Department has been funding online fact checkers.  He named the Poynter Institute which operates Politifact, a notoriously left-wing fact checker.  You might recall Facebook admitted in a lawsuit these so-called ‘fact checkers’ are really just “opinion”, left-wing opinion your State Department is only too happy to pay for.Meanwhile, Elon Musk released a first set of files showing how former Twitter executives decided to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story three weeks before the 2020 presidential election. Twitter suppressed the story under its policy against “hacked” information, but there was no evidence the information was hacked.In a second set of files released just yesterday, it was revealed the platform used several means to silence conservatives, including blacklists and shadow-banning, techniques which former Twitter executives had denied using and dismissed as conspiracy theory.  The targets included a well-known opponent of the Covid lockdowns and two conservative radio talk show hosts.  As one Twitter engineer put it, “we control visibility quite a bit. And we control the amplification of your content quite a bit. And normal people do not know how much we do.”  Twitter was taking down posts or limiting visibility as many as 200 times a day.The head of the team was Jeff Carlton, a former U.S. Naval Intelligence officer who had previously worked for the FBI counterintelligence division and CIA.  I told you earlier this week Twitter’s deputy general counsel who had advised the company to block the Hunter Biden laptop story had previously worked for the FBI.  Elon Musk fired counsel James Baker this week for suppressing information and for giving an “unconvincing” explanation for why he reviewed the new Twitter files before they were published.  So we have more than just proof of concerted action between the Biden administration and Twitter executives to support the theory Twitter had become an extension of the government to suppress speech.  We have a revolving door that placed former intelligence agency and FBI officials inside Twitter at critical junctures, adding weight to the case Twitter had become a state actor.  Personnel is policy, as they say.The Missouri Attorney General - now Senator-elect Eric Schmitt who brought the censorship case said:This is a story of the federal government with all of its vast power and authority colluding with some of the biggest companies in the history of the world to censor Americans to put their thumb on the scale for what’s out there that people can actually read about before an election. It ought to scare the bejesus out of every American, I don’t care about your political stripe.They suppressed speech and silenced conservatives, but they got caught.  Moral of the Story:  If you can’t do the time on the front page of the newspaper, don’t do the crime.",

Et que les justices belge, luxembourgeoise et française se sont, à un moment ou à un autre, intéressées à lui.    Avec, dans le détail, une affaire de prise d’otage d’une policière à Athus en Belgique pour laquelle il a été lourdement condamné, quinze mentions à son casier au Luxembourg où le prévenu est actuellement incarcéré pour extorsion, coups et blessures et vols, et désormais une affaire de séquestration à Audun-le-Tiche, en avril 2015. Affaire jugée ce mardi 6 décembre à Thionville, qui lui vaut une peine de 30 mois de prison, l’interdiction de séjour sur le sol français et de port d’arme durant une période de dix ans.    Droit dans ses bottes, stoïque, Eder Tavares rectifie au fur et à mesure l’énoncé des faits résumés par le président Eric Lambert. Il est 6h du matin le 19 avril 2015 lorsque la victime frappe à la porte de la gendarmerie d’Audun-le-Tiche. Apeuré, présentant des blessures au visage et entravé au niveau des poignets, l’homme explique qu’il a passé la nuit dans un appartement de la commune, séquestré chez le Capverdien, un certain « Goma », en présence de plusieurs individus.    Tombé dans un guet-apens, il s’avère que l’homme est en fait l’ami d’une connaissance du prévenu, connaissance qui doit à ce dernier 2 000 €. Les malfrats présents chez Goma avaient filé à Villerupt pour le détrousser. Bâillonné, il n’avait dû son salut qu’au relâchement des malfrats endormis. Ils étaient repartis de chez lui avec 740 g d’herbe de cannabis, de la drogue retrouvée par les militaires à Audun-le-Tiche, et un 22 long rifle, retrouvé chez le fameux « Goma » aux cheveux d’ébène.    Tout au long de son nouveau procès, Eder Tavares minimisera sa participation « active » lors de cette nuit où la victime et ses comparses, condamnés en 2016 entre 24 et 30 mois de prison, l’ont présenté comme « le leader ». Un temps évanoui dans la nature, Il avait fait l’objet de deux mandats d’arrêt en France, en novembre 2015 et 2021.-------À Reims, Farid tire au 44 magnum sur des vendangeurs soudanais et écope de deux mois avec sursis.------L’Union :    Rémois de 33 ans, Farid Benrazek revient de loin. À la mi-temps de son match contre la justice (pour user d’une métaphore qui colle à l’actualité), il risquait 30 ans de réclusion criminelle pour « tentative de meurtre », mais au coup de sifflet final des trois hommes et femme en noir du tribunal de Reims, il a quitté le terrain avec une petite peine de deux mois d’emprisonnement ferme pour un simple port d’arme prohibé. Magnifique remontada dont le coup d’envoi a été donné le 15 septembre 2019 au quartier Wilson.    Ce matin-là, vers 7 heures, deux frères accompagnés d’une nièce se mettent en route pour les vendanges mais une voiture garée en pleine voie leur bloque le passage, allée Jean-Sébastien-Bach. Une fille est au volant, occupée à bavarder avec deux hommes. Le groupe refuse de s’écarter, les vendangeurs s’impatientent, le klaxon retentit.    « Qu’est-ce que tu veux ? Tu cherches la merde ? » , vocifère l’un des individus en attrapant le conducteur par le col. Son frère descend pour le défendre, mais il est empoigné par l’autre homme qui lui tapote le crâne avec une bouteille d’alcool : « Tu veux que je te casse la tête ? ».    Alertés par le tumulte, une dizaine de jeunes surgissent des alentours pour frapper les deux vendangeurs à coups de poing. L’un d’eux est même mordu au flanc à travers son pull. « Cassez-vous ! Vous ne savez pas qui on est ! », hurle un agresseur. Paniquée, la nièce s’enfuit. C’est alors que Farid Benrazek arrive sur les lieux, arme au poing. Quelques instants plus tard, la jeune fille entend des coups de feu tout en assistant à la fuite de ses oncles qui sont parvenus à remonter dans l’auto. « Nous étions en train de repartir. Il nous a suivis et a tiré en visant notre voiture », accuse le conducteur. La police arrive, seul Farid est arrêté, tous les autres ont détalé et aucun ne sera identifié.Deux jours plus tard, présenté au tribunal en comparution immédiate, Farid admet avoir tiré, mais « en l’air ». « Je revenais de discothèque. Quand je suis arrivé, il y avait déjà une dizaine d’individus qui foutaient le bordel en bas de chez moi. Ma mère dormait. Je ne voulais pas qu’elle soit réveillée. SUITE",
