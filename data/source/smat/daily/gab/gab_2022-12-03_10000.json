Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

That suit accuses high-ranking government officials of working with giant social media companies \"under the guise of combating misinformation\" to achieve greater censorship.Chan, who serves in the FBI’s San Francisco bureau, was questioned under oath by court order about his alleged \"critical role\" in \"coordinating with social-media platforms relating to censorship and suppression of speech on their platforms.\"During the deposition, Chan said that he, along with the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force and senior Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency officials, had weekly meetings with major social media companies to warn against Russian disinformation attempts ahead of the 2020 election, according to a source in the Missouri attorney general's office.Those meetings were initially quarterly, then monthly, then weekly heading into the presidential election between former President Donald Trump and now President Biden.

That suit accuses high-ranking government officials of working with <br />giant social media companies \"under the guise of combating misinformation\" to achieve greater censorship.<br />Chan, who serves in the FBI’s San Francisco bureau, was questioned under oath by court order about his alleged \"critical role\" in \"coordinating with <br />social-media platforms relating to censorship and suppression of speech on their platforms.\"<br />During the deposition, Chan said that he, along with the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force and senior Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security <br />Agency officials, had weekly meetings with major social media companies to warn against Russian disinformation attempts ahead of the 2020 election, <br />according to a source in the Missouri attorney general's office.<br />Those meetings were initially quarterly, then monthly, then weekly heading into the presidential election between former President Donald Trump and <br />now President Biden.

So far Elon has met and exceeded our expectations, having restored President Trump, announced a “general amnesty for banned accounts,” and done away with the site’s old Orwellian Covid “misinformation” policy.We predicted in a now-classic piece (which Elon read) that the Regime would respond ruthlessly to such a provocation. Real free speech is simply too dangerous to be allowed, and any effort to restore it, we said, would be met with an all-out media, bureaucratic, legal, and economic assault.And now, it looks like the regime is trying to leverage one of its greatest weapons to nip Elon’s Twitter in the bud: the world’s largest company, Apple.For the time being, at least, this effort may have failed. On Wednesday afternoon, Musk tweeted about a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, and indicated there was no danger of Twitter being purged for the time being. That’s great news. But Musk, and all supporters of free speech, should remain deeply wary of Apple, both due to its immense power and because of many years of evidence of a political agenda burrowed deep into the company.It is one thing for Apple to curtail advertising with Twitter. Several companies have done that, under the pretext of “brand safety” — a mafia shakedown technique which will be the subject of a future Revolver report. It would be quite another matter for Apple to cripple Twitter’s distribution by banning them from Apple’s App Store.For all but a tiny minority of tech-savvy consumers, the App Store is the only way to add new software to an iPhone. And iPhones make up more than 50 percent of all smartphone sales in the U.S., meaning that with the push of a button, Apple could block half the country from downloading and using Twitter’s app. Since over 85 percent of all Twitter use is on mobile devices, an app store ban for Twitter would essentially be a killshot for the entire platform — just like it was for Parler, which has never recovered from the merely temporary store ban it received after January 6.For now, it looks like Apple doesn’t intend to boot out Twitter. But it is clear is that many people badly want them to do it. In an essay for The New York Times, Twitter’s own former head of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth unsubtly suggested that Google and Apple should bring Musk to heel by weaponizing their app stores. In his capacity as head of Global Head of Trust and Safety, Yoel Roth was central to the decision to suppress coverage Hunter Biden’s laptop in the weeks leading up to the 2020 Presidential election, among many other things. This is quite literally “election meddling.” To his credit, Musk has bravely announced his intention to release Twitter’s internal communications that led up to this history-altering act of political censorship.If Roth gets his way, and an app store purge eventually happens, it will likely be carried out by the “Trust and Safety” goon squads of other companies. The Orwellian label belies what the “Trust and Safety” role actually entails. The Trust and Safety head at any tech company is essentially that company’s chief censor who decides which statements are acceptable, which get labeled “harassment,” and which ideas get targeted by Artificial Intelligence for automatic deletion.Roth’s troublesome tenure as head of Twitter raises the obvious question of who his “Trust and Safety” equivalent would be at Apple. Who would play the key role in deciding how and whether to take Twitter off the App Store? Yoel Roth established his bona fides to be chief censor at Twitter with a groundbreaking dissertation on the gay-sex dating app Grindr — so what qualifications set one up to head Trust and Safety at the $2 trillion titan?The current head of Apple Trust and Safety is someone who is clearly aware of the value of having a low profile online.

Back in 2018, New York’s Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman resigned after being accused of violence by at least four women. And then last year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned after being accused of sexual harassment by a series of women.Today, Ibrahim Khan, the chief of staff to current Attorney General of New York, Letitia James, has resigned after allegations of sexual harassment:The longtime chief of staff to Letitia James, the New York attorney general, has resigned amid an investigation into misconduct, and three people with knowledge of the matter said it involved at least two sexual harassment allegations.The former chief of staff, Ibrahim Khan, had been one of Ms. James’s closest political advisers for nearly a decade. He was accused of inappropriate touching and unwanted kissing by at least one woman. Ms. James hired a law firm to investigate the allegations, two of the people with knowledge of the matter said.One woman who filed a complaint was told on Friday that her allegation of inappropriate touching and unwanted kissing had been substantiated…Multiple allegations against Mr. Kahn were reported to the attorney general’s office by a political consultant, not by the victims themselves, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.This afternoon, Khan was defending himself by suggesting he was already leaving and claiming an investigation had cleared him of any “workplace misconduct.”In a statement released Friday evening, Khan claimed he was already planning to leave his job and the decision had nothing to do with his resignation.“After a successful four-year term, I’ve been slated to leave the office for the private sector at the end of this year. This is unrelated to an investigation which, nevertheless, found no official workplace misconduct. I’m proud of all we have achieved over these past four years in serving New Yorkers,” he told The Post.It’s unclear who filed the complaints, but the source described Khan as being “in deep s–t.”…“They really tried to keep this under wraps before the election,” the source said.Leititia James was just reelected last month. No doubt this would have proved embarrassing if it had come out sooner.In any case, It’s a bit odd that Khan would resign in the face of the allegations and simultaneously claim he’d been cleared. Does that mean he was fired against his will or is the AG’s office trying to give him an easy way out? The fact that all of this is happening on a Friday evening doesn’t seem coincidental.At the moment Khan’s Twitter account is protected so he’s not saying anything directly. I’m also not seeing any comments from Letitia James. Surely she’ll be asked about it at some point. For now there’s just a statement from her office which is included in this news clip.Letitia Jameshttps://gab.com/Agitators/posts/107835619471548990Contact:https://ag.ny.gov/https://twitter.com/TishJameshttps://ballotpedia.org/Letitia_JamesPeople in PoliticsPage 1 https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087",

Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

All the proof you need follows.https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x32pvk8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDsPWmioSHghttps://tinyurl.com/mwufwd3v@AnthonySabatini @Terry603 @RepCloudTX @CatherineAustinFitts @JackyEubanks @UMLGOP @cacollegegop Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution. Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.<br /><br />Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.<br /><br />CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”<br /><br />This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how<span class=\"invisible\">-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] <a href=\"https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them <a href=\"https://logcabin.org/?s=trump\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>logcabin.org/?s=trump<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />An Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5<span class=\"invisible\">787ab75e4b0867123dff357<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celeb<span class=\"invisible\">rates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Playing lefty vs righty politics is a CFR tool to keep the 99% lower working class livestock divided and conquered and the CFR deep state in control of the government which is what they have been doing for the last 100 years. This isn't theory it is fact -- and the CFR are a deadly US sovereignty and USA constitution killing conspiratorial group.

Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.<br /><br />Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.<br /><br />CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”<br /><br />This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how<span class=\"invisible\">-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] <a href=\"https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them <a href=\"https://logcabin.org/?s=trump\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>logcabin.org/?s=trump<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />An Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5<span class=\"invisible\">787ab75e4b0867123dff357<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celeb<span class=\"invisible\">rates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors?

Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how<span class=\"invisible\">-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] <a href=\"https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them <a href=\"https://logcabin.org/?s=trump\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>logcabin.org/?s=trump<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />An Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5<span class=\"invisible\">787ab75e4b0867123dff357<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celeb<span class=\"invisible\">rates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htmThe Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them https://logcabin.org/?s=trumpAn Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.

All the proof you need follows.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x32pvk8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>dailymotion.com/video/x32pvk8<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDsPWmioSHg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>youtube.com/watch?v=hDsPWmioSHg<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/mwufwd3v\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tinyurl.com/mwufwd3v<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/AnthonySabatini\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@AnthonySabatini<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/Terry603\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@Terry603<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/RepCloudTX\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@RepCloudTX<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/CatherineAustinFitts\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@CatherineAustinFitts<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/JackyEubanks\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@JackyEubanks<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/UMLGOP\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@UMLGOP<\/a> <a href=\"https://gab.com/cacollegegop\" class=\"mention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@cacollegegop<\/a><br /><br /> Because the CFR deep state has run the USA for 100 years and are out to destroy US Sovereignty and the constitution. Abortion and Gay Marriage are two unconstitutional laws passed by a CFR packed SCOTUS to do just that. The CFR calls themselves non-partisan. That's a euphemism meaning that CFR corporations have bought enough Democratic and Republican Politicians to control both houses of congress.<br /><br />Natural law is the foundation of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and religion. We are being taught to forget both human nature and the God who created it. Four Council on Foreign Relations members have been Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O’Conner, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch. The Council on Foreign Relations are using the Supreme Court to interpret our rights to Life, Liberty and Happiness in fanciful and destructive ways. This results in insurmountable societal divisions used to divide and conquer the bewildered herd by setting us against each other and creating polarized politics.<br /><br />CFR member Republican Justice Sandra Day O’Conner helped the CFR achieve this result in the Planned Parenthood vs Casey, SCOTUS 5-4 decision, in June of 1992. Sandra Day O’Conner and republican justices Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter provided decisive swing votes to uphold Roe Vs. Wade. Their decision upholding the right to abortion stated: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.”<br /><br />This statement redefines liberty. It suggests there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles by which liberty is bound and we can do anything at all. How can our Creator have created us equal if we have the liberty to define ourselves as better than our neighbors? If O’Conner’s, Kennedy’s and Souter’s liberty were the liberty defended by the Declaration, we could never have formed a society at all.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>tomjefferson1976.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/how<span class=\"invisible\">-council-on-foreign-relations-republican-justice-sandra-day-oconner-republican-justice-anthony-kennedy-and-republican-justice-david-souter-used-their-positions-to-help-divide-and-conquer/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />the CFR runs US intel The Gay Movement: a Trojan Horse for the New World Order[12] <a href=\"https://newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>newswithviews.com/Gonzalez/servando111.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Gay Promoting LGBTQ backing Trump family promotes them <a href=\"https://logcabin.org/?s=trump\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>logcabin.org/?s=trump<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />An Openly Gay Speaker Peter Thiel Will Address The GOP Convention For The First Time In 16 Years <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5787ab75e4b0867123dff357\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>huffpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-convention_n_5<span class=\"invisible\">787ab75e4b0867123dff357<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Trump Celebrates LGBT Pride Month, Urges World to Decriminalize Homosexuality <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celebrates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>breitbart.com/politics/2019/05/31/trump-celeb<span class=\"invisible\">rates-lgbt-pride-month-urges-world-to-decriminalize-homosexuality/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Openly gay Richard Grenell is the “highest ranking openly gay official ever in a Republi-can administration,” says Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory T.
