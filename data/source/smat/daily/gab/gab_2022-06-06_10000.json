The Only requirement is that it must be based on National Socialism and Historical Revisionism.                                                                                                                                                                                                  <a href=\"https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/feed?referrer=Foghornreturns\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>minds.com/groups/profile/1061954101388107776/<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"invisible\">feed?referrer=Foghornreturns<\/span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brother Groups List                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           These are groups that are similar to this NS group but they are not the same.

In which case, the cellphones work well enough already.New York Post:----------------------------------------------------Albany pols passed a law Saturday requiring school districts statewide to seriously consider installing silent panic alarms to alert law-enforcement authorities during emergencies.The state Assembly approved “Alyssa’s Law,” named after 14-year-old Alyssa Alhadeff, who was shot and killed in 2018 during the Parkland, Florida school massacre.“Schools should be a safe place for our kids to learn and grow,” said Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie in a statement announcing the bill’s passage.Alyssa’s Law will force each school district’s safety teams to consider installing panic alarm systems and other direct communication technologies as part of their mandatory regular reviews of safety plans.The measure had previously passed in the state Senate and now heads to the governor’s desk to be signed into law.Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Mayor Eric Adams, said the city currently doesn’t believe it needs panic buttons in Big Apple schools but will review the measure.“Our children’s safety is our top priority, which is why all our public schools have School Safety Agents assigned to them,” Levy said in an email.…Some schools in New York already use panic buttons.----------------------------------------------------They’re not ever going to talk about what is causing these shootings.They will not order a study on it.Instead, they just keep coming up with these silly, nonsensical rules – because they don’t actually care if kids get shot.

Steele (July 5, 1945 - September 4, 2014) was an attorney, author, and podcaster, who worked tirelessly for the pro-White cause. He ran the website Conspiracy Penpal. He died of mysterious causes in prison a few years after being tried and convicted in a kangaroo court on charges of murder for hire in trying to kill both his wife and his mother-in-law. Neither his wife Cyndi nor his mother-in-law believe the accusations against him.\nSince his imprisonment, Cyndi has struggled to clear his name. When she asked the authorities what his motive was, they proclaimed with great certainty that it was because he wanted to collect life insurance on her. When she explained to them that they did not have life insurance on her, they changed the story to &quot;he wanted to kill her so he could have an affair with a young girl living in Ukraine&quot;. When she asked for evidence of this, they produced a package that he had supposedly sent the young girl. When she informed them that she had actually sent that package, in her husband&#39;s name, because the young lady in question had been so helpful to Mr. Steel in his research on the White Slave trade, they fell silent and couldn&#39;t produce another motive. They proceeded with the trial anyway.\nQuick facts:\n\nMr. Steele&#39;s wife Cyndi never believed the charges against her husband and has fought vigorously to clear his name.\nMr. Steele had undergone open-heart surgery, and was recovering from it, during the time he was supposedly trying to kill his wife and mother-in-law.\nFor years before his death, Mr. Steele had been stalked and bullied by the ADL of B&#39;nai B&#39;rith, an influential Jewish supremacist hate group.\nJust before the frame-up of Mr. Steele began, he had sent a copy of his book, DEFENSIVE RACISM, to both the newly elected Barack Obama and his Attorney General Eric Holder.\nIn the months leading up to his arrest, Mr. Steele was conducting research for a book on White Slavery that was intended to expose the Jewish root of that slave trade.\nThe FBI informant, Steel family handyman Larry Fairfax, who helped frame Mr. Steele, stole 10s of thousands of dollars worth of silver from the Steele family, which the FBI allowed him to keep in lieu of payment for his part in the frame-up.\nTwo well-respected audio technicians (both of whom were former law enforcement officers) listened to the FBI&#39;s recordings that were used to convict Mr. Steele and were prepared to testify that there were 100s of anomalies (even one of which would generally render such a recording inadmissible) on the tapes. They were not allowed to testify.\n\nSee TalieVision&#39;s growing playlists of of pro-White speeches, lectures, reviews, and other presentations:\nPlaylist 1: https://tv.gab.com/playlist/presentations-618bfd17ee09760530f4c830\nPlaylist 2: https://tv.gab.com/playlist/presentations-2-6246e18c63720afd4319f949\nLEARN MORE:\n&quot;The Murderers of Edgar Steele&quot;: https://nationalvanguard.org/2014/09/the-murderers-of-edgar-steele/\nMr. Steele&#39;s book, DEFENSIVE RACISM http://www.colchestercollection.com/titles/D/defensive-racism.html\nOther books on Race, Genetics, &amp; Identity: http://www.colchestercollection.com/subjects/race.html\nCrime books: http://www.colchestercollection.com/subjects/crime.html\nJewishness books: http://www.colchestercollection.com/subjects/jewishness.html\n",

          "contentraw": "Cyndi Steel's Congressional Testimony in the Frame-up of Her Husband Edgar J. Steele<br /><br />As recorded by Bill Windsor of \"Lawless America\".<br /><br />Edgar J. Steele (July 5, 1945 - September 4, 2014) was an attorney, author, and podcaster, who worked tirelessly for the pro-White cause. He ran the website Conspiracy Penpal. He died of mysterious causes in prison a few years after being tried and convicted in a kangaroo court on charges of murder for hire in trying to kill both his wife and his mother-in-law. Neither his wife Cyndi nor his mother-in-law believe the accusations against him.<br /><br />Since his imprisonment, Cyndi has struggled to clear his name. When she asked the authorities what his motive was, they proclaimed with great certainty that it was because he wanted to collect life insurance on her. When she explained to them that they did not have life insurance on her, they changed the story to \"he wanted to kill her so he could have an affair with a young girl living in Ukraine\". When she asked for evidence of this, they produced a package that he had supposedly sent the young girl. When she informed them that she had actually sent that package, in her husband's name, because the young lady in question had been so helpful to Mr. Steel in his research on the White Slave trade, they fell silent and couldn't produce another motive.
