The former president, her ex-husband, is speculated to attend the service, though that has not been confirmed.<br />Ahead of the funeral, Donald Trump and his current wife, Melania Trump, were seen arriving in New York City, according to the Daily Mail. Although they had divorced nearly three decades ago, Donald and Ivana Trump had reportedly remained in touch in the years that followed.<br />Ivana Trump had requested that instead of flowers, attendees make donations to Big Dog Ranch Rescue, a nonprofit group that hopes to reduce dog homelessness. Ivana Trump reportedly loved animals.<br />&gt;&gt;\"Ivana was philanthropically involved with many charities throughout her entire life, but always remained steadfast and passionate in her love for animals. In lieu of flowers, we kindly ask you to support Ivana in her mission to help dogs and donate to Big Dog Rescue Ranch,\" a donation page for the charity says.<br />St. Vincent Ferrer Roman Catholic Church is located in close proximity to her Upper East Side residence, according to People.<br />Ivana Trump died suddenly last Thursday at the age of 73. Police arrived on the scene, responding to reports of a cardiac event at her residence, and found her unconscious near the bottom of a staircase of her home, according to the New York City Police Department.<br /><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/everything-we-know-about-ivana-trumps-funeral\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>washingtonexaminer.com/news/everything-we-kno<span class=\"invisible\">w-about-ivana-trumps-funeral<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Yet over the years, evidence has surfaced that suggests Biden was a key power player in Hunter’s schemes.Now, according to Hunter Biden’s personal calendar, which was found on his abandoned laptop, we know that between 2008 and 2016, Hunter met with his dad at least 30 times at the White House or the vice president’s residence after returning home from overseas business trips. As The New York Post notes, these meetings “raise questions about whether Hunter was relaying messages to his father on behalf of foreign clients, and cast new doubt on the president’s repeated denials that he had any role in his son’s shady overseas business dealings.”Further incriminating Joe Biden is the fact that Eric Schwerin, the president of Hunter Biden’s investment company Rosemont Seneca Partners, was “named as a calendar invite recipient on 21 of 30 listed meetings, with a green check frequently indicating his confirmed receipt of the invite for meetings with the vice president.”Previously released visitor logs from the Obama administration indicate that Schwerin visited the White House 19 times between 2009 and 2015.During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden also denied having any knowledge of Hunter’s dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma, which gave Hunter an $83,333-per-month position on their board, despite his having zero experience in the energy sector, while his father was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine. Yet, in 2019, a photo was leaked showing the Bidens golfing with Hunter’s fellow Burisma board member Devon Archer.
