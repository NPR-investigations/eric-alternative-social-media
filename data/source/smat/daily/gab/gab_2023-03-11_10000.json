The system is known as the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) and it claims to be an efficient and cost-effective mechanism for states to maintain accurate voter rolls. ERIC is a nonprofit that was formed by leftist operatives in 2012 and, until recently, had more than 30 member states. It claims that its sole mission is assisting states to improve the accuracy of America’s voter rolls and increase access to voter registration for all eligible voters.The reality is much different and Judicial Watch offers compelling information deliberately omitted by the media in a White Paper released this week. The document presents facts that directly contradict recent news coverage attacking Republican-led states—including Florida, West Virginia, and Missouri—for cutting ties with ERIC. The New York Times expresses fervent support for ERIC, writing that the nonprofit “has faced intensifying attacks from election deniers and right-wing media.” National Public Radio proclaims that “the far right is now running a disinformation campaign against one of the best tools that states have to detect and prevent voter fraud.” The headline of a recent Washington Post story reads: “Election deniers take aim at group that helps states maintain voter rolls.” The list of media critics is extensive and ranges from national outlets to small town newspapers.The fact is that ERIC has been far more successful at identifying unregistered voters than duplicate or invalid registrations, according to research conducted by Judicial Watch. The organization reports identifying more than 60 million unregistered voters since 2012. That is not to say that it has not been effective at identifying many potentially improper or invalid voter registrations. However, certain aspects of its operations are incredibly dubious. For instance, ERIC was founded by the liberal Pew Charitable Trusts, potentially with funding that originated from leftist billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF) network. Its founder, who remains influential within the organization, has a history of leftwing activism and unethical conduct. ERIC also shares the vast amount of sensitive personal data it receives from member states with another liberal nonprofit, the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a key player in the Zuckerbucks scandal in which private entities donated millions of dollars to fund government vote counts in the 2020 elections.Records obtained by Judicial Watch show that ERIC is far more effective at swelling voter registration rolls than at keeping them clean. Our research also determined that the large amount of sensitive data provided to ERIC by member states and the organization’s role in maintaining voter rolls may violate a number of federal statutes. Among them are the Help America Vote Act, National Voter Registration Act and Driver’s Privacy Protection Act. The first statute provides states the authority and obligation to create and maintain electronic voter registration files but includes no provision that authorizes any state to outsource these obligations to a third party like ERIC. The outsourcing of voter registration list maintenance to ERIC may also violate the National Voter Registration Act, which protects from disclosure the identities of individuals who decline to register to vote. Finally, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act specifically shields from disclosure the kind of data provided to ERIC by member states to conduct list maintenance.These types of privacy concerns were among the reasons Florida officials recently severed ties with ERIC. “Withdrawing from ERIC will ensure the data privacy of Florida voters is protected,” according to an announcement issued by the Florida Department of State this week. In the press release Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd explains that he has an obligation to protect the personal information of Florida’s citizens, which ERIC requires the state to share. “Florida has tried to back reforms to increase protections, but these protections were refused,” Byrd said. “Therefore, we have lost confidence in ERIC.” Missouri Secretary of State John Ashcroft reveals that ERIC “allows for a hyper-partisan individual to be an ex-officio non-voting member on its governance board.” He also opposes ERIC’s focus on adding names to voter rolls by requiring a solicitation to individuals who already had an opportunity to register and made the conscious decision not to.",

The New York Times expresses fervent support for ERIC, writing that the nonprofit “has faced intensifying attacks from election deniers and right-wing media.” National Public Radio proclaims that “the far right is now running a disinformation campaign against one of the best tools that states have to detect and prevent voter fraud.” The headline of a recent Washington Post story reads: “Election deniers take aim at group that helps states maintain voter rolls.” The list of media critics is extensive and ranges from national outlets to small town newspapers.<br /><br />The fact is that ERIC has been far more successful at identifying unregistered voters than duplicate or invalid registrations, according to research conducted by Judicial Watch. The organization reports identifying more than 60 million unregistered voters since 2012. That is not to say that it has not been effective at identifying many potentially improper or invalid voter registrations. However, certain aspects of its operations are incredibly dubious. For instance, ERIC was founded by the liberal Pew Charitable Trusts, potentially with funding that originated from leftist billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations (OSF) network. Its founder, who remains influential within the organization, has a history of leftwing activism and unethical conduct. ERIC also shares the vast amount of sensitive personal data it receives from member states with another liberal nonprofit, the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a key player in the Zuckerbucks scandal in which private entities donated millions of dollars to fund government vote counts in the 2020 elections.<br /><br />Records obtained by Judicial Watch show that ERIC is far more effective at swelling voter registration rolls than at keeping them clean. Our research also determined that the large amount of sensitive data provided to ERIC by member states and the organization’s role in maintaining voter rolls may violate a number of federal statutes. Among them are the Help America Vote Act, National Voter Registration Act and Driver’s Privacy Protection Act. The first statute provides states the authority and obligation to create and maintain electronic voter registration files but includes no provision that authorizes any state to outsource these obligations to a third party like ERIC. The outsourcing of voter registration list maintenance to ERIC may also violate the National Voter Registration Act, which protects from disclosure the identities of individuals who decline to register to vote. Finally, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act specifically shields from disclosure the kind of data provided to ERIC by member states to conduct list maintenance.<br /><br />These types of privacy concerns were among the reasons Florida officials recently severed ties with ERIC. “Withdrawing from ERIC will ensure the data privacy of Florida voters is protected,” according to an announcement issued by the Florida Department of State this week. In the press release Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd explains that he has an obligation to protect the personal information of Florida’s citizens, which ERIC requires the state to share. “Florida has tried to back reforms to increase protections, but these protections were refused,” Byrd said. “Therefore, we have lost confidence in ERIC.” Missouri Secretary of State John Ashcroft reveals that ERIC “allows for a hyper-partisan individual to be an ex-officio non-voting member on its governance board.” He also opposes ERIC’s focus on adding names to voter rolls by requiring a solicitation to individuals who already had an opportunity to register and made the conscious decision not to.",

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) told the Post that Adams “is incentivizing and rewarding illegal immigration simply to export the crisis of Democrats’ own making out of New York City.”Breitbart News noted that, “[s]ince April 2021, some 50,000 migrants have arrived in the Democrat-run sanctuary city, with more than 30,000 still in the city’s care.”Many of these individuals are being sheltered in 85 hotels using taxpayer funding. The massive influx of migrants has harmed small businesses that typically rely on tourist dollars to stay afloat.In a statement announcing the creation of the OASA, Adams said:New Yorkers know that the asylum seeker of today is the citizen, the leader, and the innovator of tomorrow, and I’m proud that New York City is leading the way, turning a crisis into an opportunity for progress for the entire country.State Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told the Post that the mayor “is trying to spread the burden throughout the state,” and that he and Gov. Kathy Hochul “are basically covering for Biden’s failure to control the southern border.”He added: “I guess this is about as clear as we can get that the Biden administration is not helping us at all — and that it’s simply on us to set these people up for the rest of their lives in the US.”So, let’s sum this up, shall we?New York City has been experiencing a serious influx of migrants and illegal aliens because President Joe Biden is not serious about securing the border or enforcing immigration policy. In response, Mayor Adams is forcing residents to pay for their lodging and wishes to take their money to also pay for 100 of these folks to attend college. This, while New York City’s businesses are suffering.Sounds pretty progressive, doesn’t it?New York City Mayor Eric Adamshttps://gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748Contact:http://ericadams2021.comhttps://www.facebook.com/80559174013https://www.instagram.com/ericadamsfornycPeople in PoliticsPage 1 https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087",

One of the founders was former Lyft executive Dor Levi, who provided Newcomer with text updates from the scene.    -Silicon Valley Bank CEO sold $3.5M in shares just two weeks before collapse    -JPM bankers pull all-nighters to take on clients of Silicon Valley Bank    -Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse sends shivers through China startupsThe incident was the latest indication of growing panic among investors linked to the tech lender, which warned of a cash crunch this week that sparked a run on the bank.SVB blocked Levi and others who gathered from entering the building. By around 9:20 a.m. ET, building officials “called the police” and a pair of NYPD vehicles had arrived.Levi “said the police were very friendly and instructed one person who didn’t want to leave SVB’s offices that they had to exit the building,” Newcomer wrote.    Police Respond to Founders Gathered Outside SVB's New York Office, Withdrawals Continue &amp; JPM Pens Supportive Note    — Eric Newcomer (EricNewcomer) March 10, 2023The officers “just left” afterward, according to Levy.Levi told Newcomer that he went to the SVB branch after one of the institution’s bankers told him “to go and get a cashier’s check from the New York office if he wanted to move his funds.”Levi reportedly added that there were “more founders coming every minute” before the police response.Silicon Valley Bank is facing a sudden cash crunch.The incident was the latest indication of growing panic among investors linked to the tech lender.Similarly, dozens of clients lined up to empty their accounts from a SVB branch in Menlo Park, California — an area populated by venture capitalist offices —&nbsp;video posted to Twitter shows.The long line of founders stretched around the block, leaving the founders to wait in the sidewalk-less streets and in the pouring rain.When reached for comment, the NYPD said it had no updates to share as of around 11:15 a.m. ET.When The Post attempted to contact SVB’s Manhattan office, its general phone line rang twice and then disconnected.SVB representatives did not immediately return a request for comment.Newcomer said he had spoken to a “major investor who said that about ten of his portfolio companies had pulled out about $1.5 billion collectively from Silicon Valley Bank.”“The companies put in their requests around 6 p.m. Eastern Time Thursday and got their money this morning,” Newcomer added.On Friday morning, CNBC reported that SVB was in talks to sell itself after failing in its efforts to raise capital. “Large financial institutions” are potentially weighing an acquisition of SVB Financial, the bank’s parent.Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund was among the institutions telling clients to pull their money out of SVB..Before trading of SVB Financial shares was halted on Friday morning, the stock had plunged more than 60%. That followed a previous 60% plunge in Thursday trading.Investors scrambled to withdraw their money even as the company’s CEO begged clients to “stay calm” during a conference call on Thursday.https://nypost.com/2023/03/10/nypd-called-to-silicon-valley-bank-branch-as-depositors-attempt-to-pull-cash-report/",

Then his even littler brother who was holding his big brother’s hand said: “I can lift all the people”It was a funny moment of connection, but the reality of what was happening didn’t escape me as I looked at this young mother surrounded by her three boys. I have no idea where “Dad” was, but these two little musclemen telling me they were strong while clinging to their mommy’s hands let me know what was probably deep in the heart of this family’s story. Little boys having to be strong is a tragic reality that plagues our broken and shattered home fronts.But it’s not just boys, last night one young girl casually told one of my leaders that they were there because daddy hits mommy. It was said in a manner that was way too normal but for too many children…it is their normal.To be a big man in a crisis shelter is an unnerving thing. I am acutely aware that for many in the room I am a reminder of hell and horror.To sit at a table next to a woman who doesn’t know me or is possibly there to get away from some man is a profoundly challenging reality to try to navigate. I am aware and do my very best to be present in a way that’s gentle, humble and loving but cautious. It’s common to be ignored.But I persist.I do so because of many reasons but one of the biggest is I see the look in children’s faces when I come into the room, it’s the look of longing. Even after all the chaos, drama and trauma these little ones have experienced, they still reach out for something within them that they need: love from a father.“Sit by me” is a request that captures the great need of a generation’s soul in this moment.To have a young man wave at me as he leads his little brothers up to a shelter room is an act of gratitude that reflects a heart that’s starving for kindness.To almost stumble over a small little girl with big eyes and a dollie in her hand that’s following me around is a sign of the deep need for attention.To have an little spitfire African American girl come up to me and place both her hands on my beard and rub my face is a gift born out of small sense of safety.When a young girl looks at LeeElla and I there together and declares: “You are her husband!” reflects a recognition of a reality that’s painfully absent from her own life.As I watched LeeElla try to wipe off the Ravioli sauce from her shirt as she began to lead worship in the chapel service, I realized something. That sauce slopped upon her face and clothes by a rambunctious lap nestling squiggler was actually the anointing oil of the Holy Ghost. A symbol of the signs and wonders being displayed where love is seeking to serve the orphan and widows among us.Watching a little pistol of a girl walking up the stairs holding LeeElla’s hands to show her the room where she stays is the kind of gentle miracle that sustain my battle-weary heart. These are the victories of love and these fleeting moments remind me love is stronger than death.I just wish I was strong enough to “lift all the people” out of their desperate situations but at least last night a few kids met a man and a woman that loved them.\"Pastor Eric.",

            "description": "Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I’m @Shooglenifty. God is good and His mercy endures forever!***By posting you are agreeing to our posting standards. We will remove a post according to our interpretation (written by us) of the guidelines below. If there is any confusion, please DM.***My hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.” Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n\r\n***PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING: Posts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n\r\n***It seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one-line posts in a row pushing someone else's well-thought post or plea out of sight of the group? \r\n\r\nWith that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off-topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, argumentative, disrespectful or racist posts.\r\n\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n\r\n***Remember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n\r\n***“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.” Numbers 6:24-27 ESV\r\n\r\n***Group Creator:  @Micaiah\r\nAdmins/Mods: @Shooglenifty, @riustan",

Then his even littler brother who was holding his big brother’s hand said: “I can lift all the people”It was a funny moment of connection, but the reality of what was happening didn’t escape me as I looked at this young mother surrounded by her three boys. I have no idea where “Dad” was, but these two little musclemen telling me they were strong while clinging to their mommy’s hands let me know what was probably deep in the heart of this family’s story. Little boys having to be strong is a tragic reality that plagues our broken and shattered home fronts.But it’s not just boys, last night one young girl casually told one of my leaders that they were there because daddy hits mommy. It was said in a manner that was way too normal but for too many children…it is their normal.To be a big man in a crisis shelter is an unnerving thing. I am acutely aware that for many in the room I am a reminder of hell and horror.To sit at a table next to a woman who doesn’t know me or is possibly there to get away from some man is a profoundly challenging reality to try to navigate. I am aware and do my very best to be present in a way that’s gentle, humble and loving but cautious. It’s common to be ignored.But I persist.I do so because of many reasons but one of the biggest is I see the look in children’s faces when I come into the room, it’s the look of longing. Even after all the chaos, drama and trauma these little ones have experienced, they still reach out for something within them that they need: love from a father.“Sit by me” is a request that captures the great need of a generation’s soul in this moment.To have a young man wave at me as he leads his little brothers up to a shelter room is an act of gratitude that reflects a heart that’s starving for kindness.To almost stumble over a small little girl with big eyes and a dollie in her hand that’s following me around is a sign of the deep need for attention.To have an little spitfire African American girl come up to me and place both her hands on my beard and rub my face is a gift born out of small sense of safety.When a young girl looks at LeeElla and I there together and declares: “You are her husband!” reflects a recognition of a reality that’s painfully absent from her own life.As I watched LeeElla try to wipe off the Ravioli sauce from her shirt as she began to lead worship in the chapel service, I realized something. That sauce slopped upon her face and clothes by a rambunctious lap nestling squiggler was actually the anointing oil of the Holy Ghost. A symbol of the signs and wonders being displayed where love is seeking to serve the orphan and widows among us.Watching a little pistol of a girl walking up the stairs holding LeeElla’s hands to show her the room where she stays is the kind of gentle miracle that sustain my battle-weary heart. These are the victories of love and these fleeting moments remind me love is stronger than death.I just wish I was strong enough to “lift all the people” out of their desperate situations but at least last night a few kids met a man and a woman that loved them.\"Pastor Eric.",

          "content": "By Ryan MorganMarch 9, 2023Updated: March 10, 2023House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has agreed to a full public release of the security footage recorded at the U.S. Capitol during the events of Jan. 6, 2021.In an interview with Breitbart News that aired on Thursday, McCarthy discussed his decision to share the footage with Fox News host Tucker Carlson and said defendants who are facing charges after going to the Capitol on Jan. 6 should be able to see the footage for their own defense in court.When asked whether he would fully release the Capitol security footage to the public, the Republican House speaker responded in the affirmative before adding that the footage would first have to go through a security review.“We just want to make sure we go through them all, and it takes time,” he said.McCarthy’s assurance that he would pursue a broad public release of the security footage comes as a growing number of January 6 defendants have asked for their trials to be delayed so they can review the security footage.McCarthy told Breitbart he was making no personal judgment about what the security footage shows, but said that “to be fair in equal justice, if there’s any person that’s accused, they should be able to have a right to see the tapes to make their own defense.”Some of the Capitol security footage that Carlson aired on Monday night showed police officers leading Jacob Chansley—the so-called QAnon Shaman—around the building. Carlson described the officers as having acted like “tour guides” for Chansley, who pleaded guilty to a count of “obstruction of an official proceeding” and was sentenced to more than four and a half years in prison.After seeing the new footage shared by Carlson, Chansley’s former attorney Albert Watkins told Fox News he had not been able to review this same footage before his client signed a plea agreement. Watkins said he had requested any evidence that could support his client’s innocence and, regardless of his own requests for the footage, said prosecutors had “an absolute duty” to provide such evidence.Democrats Say McCarthy Jeopardizing Capitol SecuritySeveral Democratic lawmakers have accused McCarthy of jeopardizing the security of the U.S. Capitol with his decision to share security footage with Carlson and, potentially, the broader public.In an interview with MSNBC, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said that by sharing the Jan. 6 Capitol security footage, McCarthy “just gave the proudest boy of all a blueprint for the Capitol … who knows where that will land for the next insurrection.”Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) has said McCarthy “owes the American people an explanation of why he has done so and what steps he has taken to address the significant security concerns at stake.”Republicans have pushed back on claims that they are compromising security by sharing the footage. Last week, Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said Carlson’s Fox News team was only allowed to view the tapes under a controlled setting and had to request footage, which would then go through a security review, before the production team could have a copy.During the Breitbart News interview, McCarthy again said a security team is reviewing the footage before sharing it with members of the news media or the broader public. McCarthy said the review is looking for various security details that would need to be protected, like special exits for lawmakers.“The most interesting thing, when I sat down, when I had the team talk to the Capitol police about making sure they had no problems with the exits and so on, they said [the Democrat-led Jan. 6 Committee], never asked them that,” McCarthy told Breitbart, adding that the committee “showed the exit of the vice president, they showed the exit from my office, they literally had [then-House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi’s daughter showing a secure location that they take the leadership. That’s not supposed to be known to anybody, and CNN reported it, and I don’t remember the press ever getting upset with that.”McCarthy also pushed back on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) after the senator accused Carlson of downplaying the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and called for Fox News to stop Carlson from sharing additional footage.“I wish Chuck Schumer would read the Constitution,” McCarthy said. “The Democrats always go to censorship. … They want to use government as much as they can to censor people.”From NTD Newshttps://www.theepochtimes.com/mccarthy-agrees-to-full-public-release-of-jan-6-tapes_5112104.html?utm_source=share-btn-copylink",
          "contentraw": "By Ryan Morgan<br />March 9, 2023Updated: March 10, 2023<br /><br />House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has agreed to a full public release of the security footage recorded at the U.S. Capitol during the events of Jan. 6, 2021.<br /><br />In an interview with Breitbart News that aired on Thursday, McCarthy discussed his decision to share the footage with Fox News host Tucker Carlson and said defendants who are facing charges after going to the Capitol on Jan. 6 should be able to see the footage for their own defense in court.<br /><br />When asked whether he would fully release the Capitol security footage to the public, the Republican House speaker responded in the affirmative before adding that the footage would first have to go through a security review.<br /><br />“We just want to make sure we go through them all, and it takes time,” he said.<br /><br />McCarthy’s assurance that he would pursue a broad public release of the security footage comes as a growing number of January 6 defendants have asked for their trials to be delayed so they can review the security footage.<br /><br />McCarthy told Breitbart he was making no personal judgment about what the security footage shows, but said that “to be fair in equal justice, if there’s any person that’s accused, they should be able to have a right to see the tapes to make their own defense.”<br /><br />Some of the Capitol security footage that Carlson aired on Monday night showed police officers leading Jacob Chansley—the so-called QAnon Shaman—around the building. Carlson described the officers as having acted like “tour guides” for Chansley, who pleaded guilty to a count of “obstruction of an official proceeding” and was sentenced to more than four and a half years in prison.<br /><br />After seeing the new footage shared by Carlson, Chansley’s former attorney Albert Watkins told Fox News he had not been able to review this same footage before his client signed a plea agreement. Watkins said he had requested any evidence that could support his client’s innocence and, regardless of his own requests for the footage, said prosecutors had “an absolute duty” to provide such evidence.<br /><br />Democrats Say McCarthy Jeopardizing Capitol Security<br /><br />Several Democratic lawmakers have accused McCarthy of jeopardizing the security of the U.S. Capitol with his decision to share security footage with Carlson and, potentially, the broader public.<br /><br />In an interview with MSNBC, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said that by sharing the Jan. 6 Capitol security footage, McCarthy “just gave the proudest boy of all a blueprint for the Capitol … who knows where that will land for the next insurrection.”<br /><br />Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) has said McCarthy “owes the American people an explanation of why he has done so and what steps he has taken to address the significant security concerns at stake.”<br /><br />Republicans have pushed back on claims that they are compromising security by sharing the footage. Last week, Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said Carlson’s Fox News team was only allowed to view the tapes under a controlled setting and had to request footage, which would then go through a security review, before the production team could have a copy.<br /><br />During the Breitbart News interview, McCarthy again said a security team is reviewing the footage before sharing it with members of the news media or the broader public. McCarthy said the review is looking for various security details that would need to be protected, like special exits for lawmakers.<br /><br />“The most interesting thing, when I sat down, when I had the team talk to the Capitol police about making sure they had no problems with the exits and so on, they said [the Democrat-led Jan. 6 Committee], never asked them that,” McCarthy told Breitbart, adding that the committee “showed the exit of the vice president, they showed the exit from my office, they literally had [then-House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi’s daughter showing a secure location that they take the leadership. That’s not supposed to be known to anybody, and CNN reported it, and I don’t remember the press ever getting upset with that.”<br /><br />McCarthy also pushed back on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) after the senator accused Carlson of downplaying the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and called for Fox News to stop Carlson from sharing additional footage.<br /><br />“I wish Chuck Schumer would read the Constitution,” McCarthy said. “The Democrats always go to censorship. … They want to use government as much as they can to censor people.”<br /><br />From NTD News<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/mccarthy-agrees-to-full-public-release-of-jan-6-tapes_5112104.html?utm_source=share-btn-copylink\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>theepochtimes.com/mccarthy-agrees-to-full-pub<span class=\"invisible\">lic-release-of-jan-6-tapes_5112104.html?utm_source=share-btn-copylink<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

The bottom line is they realistically have no idea about what they’re talking. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23, John 15:2 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of those types of “salvation by works” cults and false religions. On the other hand, Titus 3:9-11 is aimed directly at Judaism and contains instructions for those born again regarding those wrapped up in it.“I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late sounds MUCH better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is...(Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). God The Father is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about His finished work on the cross or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen G. White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER. It’s cults which add to Calvary, not the Gospel message (1 John 3:23, 1 John 5:10). Those born again will automatically “remain” in Jesus.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with God The Father). Seventh Day Adventism is probably the creepiest cult out there. All of the others are blatant fakes but SDA merely “blends in like another denomination” (whatever a “denomination” is...).It’s not even REMOTELY close, actually. The list is long. That’s tragic, actually.By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus at Calvary and with His Resurrection. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel message ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (2 Corinthians 3:4-11). As such, that person is a partaker in the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:3-4). We’re under grace. Jesus fulfilled 100% of the law. Because of that, God The Father changes what you want should you decide to choose in His favor. (See Romans 5:10 and Hebrews 10:14 for more information.)

Curses are curses (see Matthew 13:14-15, Matthew 27:25 and Romans 11:7-8 for more information on that curse put on Israel by The Lord for the higher-ups rejecting Jesus as the Messiah and instead handing Him over to the Romans to be crucified.",
