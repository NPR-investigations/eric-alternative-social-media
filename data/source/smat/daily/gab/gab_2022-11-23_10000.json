But if you review what I have been warning about with ERIC for 9 months you will see what a slippery slope this is.If ERIC compares the voter registration database against the DMV and the Bureau of Vital Statistics (They have been granted special access to both databases. Illegally as they have access to the citizens data as a non governmental entity). After the comparison they will have the data of everyone that could be registered that is not registered. They also have access to Lexus/Nexus and AI. Using those other databases they can predict several things. Like who is most likely to vote liberal versus conservative. Or even more importantly who is not likely to vote at all. Either criteria you are looking for results in lists of potential registrations along with all the valid data required to create a new voter registration.Using scripts as the man mentions you can create thousands of new voter registrations. If even more nefarious and given admin access to the election database you can use scripts to vote for those new registrations as well. That is unlikely because it would require a pause in the counting of several hours. OH, that's right Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia seem to be having overnight pauses since 2020. Humm what a coincidence. The other coincidence is they all change directions after the pauses. The third (Really about 15 coincidences) coincidence is they all change to have a very liberal bias after the pauses. I have warned people ever since I found out the special access ERIC has the election can very easily become a (S)election with this special access. Remove the machines and remove ERIC ASAP. The elections are at risk from any reasonably experienced database manager with a programming team of even 3 people.",

At 1;00 minute until 1:35 seconds they tell you what their desire is straight out. To use scripting to create voter registration files. To a non IT professional that might sound reasonable. But if you review what I have been warning about with ERIC for 9 months you will see what a slippery slope this is.If ERIC compares the voter registration database against the DMV and the Bureau of Vital Statistics (They have been granted special access to both databases. Illegally as they have access to the citizens data as a non governmental entity). After the comparison they will have the data of everyone that could be registered that is not registered. They also have access to Lexus/Nexus and AI. Using those other databases they can predict several things. Like who is most likely to vote liberal versus conservative. Or even more importantly who is not likely to vote at all. Either criteria you are looking for results in lists of potential registrations along with all the valid data required to create a new voter registration.Using scripts as the man mentions you can create thousands of new voter registrations. If even more nefarious and given admin access to the election database you can use scripts to vote for those new registrations as well. That is unlikely because it would require a pause in the counting of several hours. OH, that's right Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia seem to be having overnight pauses since 2020. Humm what a coincidence. The other coincidence is they all change directions after the pauses. The third (Really about 15 coincidences) coincidence is they all change to have a very liberal bias after the pauses. I have warned people ever since I found out the special access ERIC has the election can very easily become a (S)election with this special access. Remove the machines and remove ERIC ASAP. The elections are at risk from any reasonably experienced database manager with a programming team of even 3 people.",

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

Its started in 1293 by orders of Torkel Knutsson, the Lord High Constable of Sweden who in the 1290s led the so-called Third Finnish Crusade, actually aimed against Rus' of Novgorod. He chose the location of the new fortress to keep the Bay of Vyborg, which was a trading site used by locals already for a long time. From the bay, a river connects the place to several districts, lakes, and indirectly also to  Ladoga.The castle became the stronghold of the Swedish realm in Karelian regions. Throughout the centuries, it was the first defense of the kingdom against Rus'. Its military and strategic status was in the late Middle Ages only second to the fortified capital Stockholm. The castle and the large surrounding fief became a virtually autonomous principality. Its governors were usually enfeoffed with the income of the county. The fief of Viborg became known as a margraviate. Its governors were generally from the most powerful families of the kingdom. They enjoyed large administrative powers and a good distance from the capital. Those realities made them practically independent rulers. Moreover, the castle of Olavinlinna (built in 1470s) was subjugated to Viipuri.Prominent figures who held Viipuri as fief, were Bo Jonsson Grip, Christer Nilsson Vasa (1417–42), Karl Knutsson Bonde (1442–48, the future king), Eric Axelsson Tott (1457–81), Knut Posse (1495–97), Sten Sture the Elder (1497–99, between his regencies), Eric Bielke and count John of Hoya.The first mention of firearms in Finland relates to Viborg castle, in 1429. During the Middle Ages the castle was repeatedly besieged by the Muscovites, most famously in 1495, during the Russo-Swedish War (1495–1497). Governor Knut Posse was in office 1495-1497. The situation of the defenders looked hopeless, but they were saved by the Viborg blast on 30 November 1495, a mysterious explosion which scared off the Muscovites because they reportedly saw a St. Andrew's cross in the sky.In the 17th century, the castle was allowed to decay, as during the Times of Trouble, the Russian threat decreased and the border was moved farther eastwards. Vyborg was taken by the Russians in 1710, but passed back to Finnish hands in 1812 when all of Old Finland was attached to the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. The castle owes its present appearance to extensive restorations undertaken in the 1890s. The military of the Russian Empire used the castle until 1918 for purely administration purposes. Viipuri belonged to the independent Republic of Finland between 1917 and 1940 and again, between 1941 and 1944. As a result of border changes in World War II it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1944.The main castle, located in the eastern part of the islet on its highest hill, has an irregular four-cornered layout, with the immense tower of St. Olav (Pyhän Olavin torni in Finnish) as its biggest section. It is 3-4 stories tall, varying in places. Outer defensive works surround the main castle, following the islet's coastlines. Today it functions as a museum.",

We plan to get answers on behalf of the American people. Stay tuned.” “We all deserve to know how involved Dr. Fauci was in the censorship of the American people during the COVID pandemic; tomorrow, I hope to find out. And I will continue fighting for the truth as it relates to Big Government colluding with Big Tech to stifle free speech,” said Attorney General Landry. Missouri and Louisiana filed this landmark lawsuit in May of 2022 and have since received discovery showing that the federal government and the Biden Administration have worked with social media companies to censor speech on topics like COVID-19 and other issues.   A federal court granted Missouri and Louisiana’s request for depositions of top Biden Administration officials on October 21, 2022. Additionally, a magistrate judge in Virginia rejected former White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s attempt to quash a subpoena in this case and transferred that dispute back to Louisiana.",

          "content": "\"It's Time We Talked About The Pedophilia Problem Within The Elite\"Fox News host Tucker Carlson has stated that it is time for the American nation to address the elephant in the room - pedophilia among the elite.vaccording to Carlson, a shadowy cabal of pedophiles at the highest levels of politics, finance and the entertainment industry are using their power to cover up the sickening crimes against children.http://Foxnews.com reports:Jeffrey Epstein, for example, continued to dine with business magnates and heads of state long after he was arrested for having sex with minors. How did he do that? Why didn't anyone say anything? Why did people keep eating with him? Well, we can at least conclude, based on the evidence, that there is a tolerance for pedophilia among some, among the most powerful in our society, a tolerance that you wouldn't find in, say, the average American family from the middle class. Some rich are really different. That is clearly true and if you need any more proof, take a look at Balenciaga. Balenciaga is what is called a luxury brand.Balenciaga is a company that sells $1,100 sneakers and $1,500 cotton sweatshirts to people who literally don't know what to buy anymore. You probably don't do your back-to-school shopping at Balenciaga, but apparently some people do. This week, Balenciaga rolled out a new ad campaign on Instagram and the ads' selling point was sex with children. One photo showed a very young girl lying face down on a sofa with candles, empty wine glasses and a dog collar on a coffee table in front of her. Another photo showed the same girl, a toddler, holding a teddy bear dressed in sexual bondage gear including a leather harness and then, in case you missed the point, we Balenciaga are for pedophilia, another photo made it explicit.That photo showed pages of a Supreme Court opinion that overturned a law against child pornography. Whoever organized the photo shoot made sure to include some of the advice that used the word “sex” or “sexual” four times, and of course that wasn't a coincidence. Balenciaga wanted you to notice. This seemed like a big story to us, as we told you last night. Here you have a major international retail brand that promotes child pornography and sex with children, not subtly, but openly.No sane society can tolerate that, and in fact no society has ever tolerated that. There has never been a time in American history when pedophilia was considered anything but the worst, the most heinous crime imaginable. Pedophiles are killed in prison because even murderers consider them immoral. That's how far it goes and has always been to sexualize children.It is totally unacceptable, but apparently it is not unacceptable anymore. Academics have redefined child molesters as minor attracted persons, and the intent, of course, is to get the message across that it's not really that bad. It's just a different kind of love. So, perhaps unsurprisingly given that trend, almost all news outlets, with a few isolated exceptions in the US media, completely ignored Balenciaga's child porn advertising campaign.There wasn't a single story about it this morning in the New York Times or Jeff Bezos' Washington Post or on CNN or NBC. There was no investigation or boycott. The usual indignant merchants remained completely silent because they were not indignant. Balenciaga eventually released a statement saying it was going to punish the photographer who did the shoot like it was the photographer's fault and they didn't know about it and after that the story effectively died and that means Balenciaga's CEO , a man named Cédric Charbit, will not become a social pariah for what his company has just done. Like Jeffrey Epstein, he will continue to enjoy his busy social life, fully \"punished\" with his many fabulous celebrity friendsFor example, here he is with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who looks very excited to be with him. Well, by the way, we found that photo online in less than a minute. As far as we know, other than us on this broadcast, no one has asked Eric Adams about it, and it's likely no one ever will, and the reason is simple. The media is not interested in covering the sexualization of children. Their interest, and it is a very intense interest, is to destroy anyone who complains about or even notices the sexualization of children. Noticing it, they say, is an attack on the LGBT communityThe assumption here, their assumption apparently is that gays are in favor of molesting children and of course performing female genital mutilation, but that is absurd. No normal person is for this, gay or not. It is not anti-gay to be against child pornography or to feel disgusted by doctors cutting off the breasts of healthy teenage girls. These are crimes and most gays think they are crimesRead morehttps://www.frontnieuws.com/tucker-carlson-het-is-tijd-dat-we-praten-over-het-pedofilieprobleem-binnen-de-elite/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=notification&amp;utm_id=729903",

Noticing it, they say, is an attack on the LGBT community<br /><br />The assumption here, their assumption apparently is that gays are in favor of molesting children and of course performing female genital mutilation, but that is absurd. No normal person is for this, gay or not. It is not anti-gay to be against child pornography or to feel disgusted by doctors cutting off the breasts of healthy teenage girls. These are crimes and most gays think they are crimes<br /><br />Read more<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.frontnieuws.com/tucker-carlson-het-is-tijd-dat-we-praten-over-het-pedofilieprobleem-binnen-de-elite/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=notification&amp;utm_id=729903\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>frontnieuws.com/tucker-carlson-het-is-tijd-da<span class=\"invisible\">t-we-praten-over-het-pedofilieprobleem-binnen-de-elite/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=notification&amp;utm_id=729903<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

His Role in the Iran Contra AffairBarr: CIA operative It is a sobering fact that American presidents (many of whom have been corrupt) have gone out of their way to hire fixers to be their attorney generals.Consider recent history: Loretta Lynch (2015-2017), Eric Holder (2009-2015), Michael Mukasey (2007-2009), Alberto Gonzales (2005-2007), John Ashcroft (2001-2005),Janet Reno (1993-2001), Dick Thornburgh (1988-1991), Ed Meese (1985-1988), etc.Barr, however, is a particularly spectacular and sordid case. As George H.W. Bush’s most notorious insider, and as the AG from 1991 to 1993, Barr wreaked havoc, flaunted the rule of law, and proved himself to be one of the CIA/Deep State’s greatest and most ruthless champions and protectors:    Barr was a full-time CIA operative, recruited by Langley out of high school, starting in 1971. Barr’s youth career goal was to head the CIA.    CIA operative assigned to the China directorate, where he became close to powerful CIA operative George H.W. Bush, whose accomplishments already included the CIA/Cuba Bay of Pigs, Asia CIA operations (Vietnam War, Golden Triangle narcotics), Nixon foreign policy (Henry Kissinger), and the Watergate operation.    When George H.W. Bush became CIA Director in 1976, Barr joined the CIA’s “legal office” and Bush’s inner circle, and worked alongside Bush’s longtime CIA enforcers Theodore “Ted” Shackley, Felix Rodriguez, Thomas Clines, and others, several of whom were likely involved with the Bay of Pigs/John F. Kennedy assassination, and numerous southeast Asian operations, from the Phoenix Program to Golden Triangle narco-trafficking.    Barr stonewalled and destroyed the Church Committee investigations into CIA abuses.    Barr stonewalled and stopped inquiries in the CIA bombing assassination of Chilean opposition leader Orlando Letelier.    Barr joined George H.W. Bush’s legal/intelligence team during Bush’s vice presidency (under President Ronald Reagan) Rose from assistant attorney general to Chief Legal Counsel to attorney general (1991) during the Bush 41 presidency.    Barr was a key player in the Iran-Contra operation, if not the most important member of the apparatus, simultaneously managing the operation while also “fixing” the legal end, ensuring that all of the operatives could do their jobs without fear of exposure or arrest.    In his attorney general confirmation, Barr vowed to “attack criminal organizations”, drug smugglers and money launderers. It was all hot air: as AG, Barr would preserve, protect, cover up, and nurture the apparatus that he helped create, and use Justice Department power to escape punishment.    Barr stonewalled and stopped investigations into all Bush/Clinton and CIA crimes, including BCCI and BNL CIA drug banking, the theft of Inslaw/PROMIS software, and all crimes of state committed by Bush    Barr provided legal cover for Bush’s illegal foreign policy and war crimes    Barr left Washington, and went through the “rotating door” to the corporate world, where he took on numerous directorships and counsel positions for major companies.

Get the news that matters most delivered directly to your inbox.Your emailSIGN UPThe left-wing radical behind the heavily criticized 1619 Project took to Twitter to mock an Asian activist who raised concerns about subway safety in New York City — and as you might guess, lapdog leftists who follow Nikole Hannah-Jones on the social media platform were only too eager to pile on after her.What are the details?It all started when Yiatin Chu posted the following tweet Thursday:“Paid $2.75 to be in a subway car with a loud and aggressive man threatening to hit his female partner,\" she wrote. \"Switched cars at next stop to be in a public toilet / urine-odor, crowded car for the rest of my ride.”In a follow-up tweet Chu threw shade at just-elected New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, both Democrats: “Hochul and Adams own it. They said so themselves.” The New York Post said Chu was referring to Hochul and Adams' recent promise to increase police presence in subways amid spiking crime there.Don't miss out on content from Dave Rubin free of big tech censorship. Listen to The Rubin Report now.Well, Hannah-Jones wasn't having it — and mocked Chu's concerns: “Yes, yes,” she tweeted back. “This was absolutely unheard on subways until two years ago.”Hannah-Jones also boasts nearly 675,000 Twitter followers, and some of them saw an opening to jump into the fray against Chu, who sports a far less commanding 6,345 followers as of Tuesday afternoon.\"Honey, I remember paying 20 cents for all that in 1970, but you know, prices go up over the years,\" one Hannah-Jones devotee told Chu. \"It's always been like that. Welcome to New York. Now, if you don't like it, I suggest you leave.\"Another fired a back a rather stunning comment to Chu, considering the left's love for folks illegally crossing our borders: \"I see your profile indicates you are an immigrant. A very recent immigrant, I take it?\"\"Child, this is NYC,\" another Chu opponent wrote. \"NYC yesterday today and tomorrow. Get with it or get lost.\"You get the idea.Chu told the Post that Hannah-Jones' followers \"were purposely being unkind\" and that \"she makes these snarky comments, and she’s inviting them all to pile on.”The Post did note that others defended Chu, such as Manhattan parent activist Maud Maron, who in responding to Hannah-Jones tossed cold water on those who assume Chu just arrived in New York City.\"Nikole grew up in Iowa. Yiatin grew up in Queens. Yiatin went to public school in Queens as an English language learner and commuted to Bronx Science as a teenager in the 80s…some of us have decades of NYC living to draw on, not just the last two (admittedly garbage) years,\" Maron wrote.Another shot back at Hannah-Jones with the following: \"Why are you denying Yiatin's lived experience? She didn't say it was unheard of 2 years ago but anyone who rides the subway knows that these incidents have increased &amp; no amount of gaslighting will erase them. Minimizing is petty. You're not helping anyone by doing it.\"The Post said Chu isn't deterred by Hannah-Jones: “I just want a peaceful ride when I get on the train. I pay my fare, I just want to get home. Is that too much to ask? As New Yorkers, why should we accept what our subways have become?”Anything else?Hannah-Jones created the 1619 Project for the New York Times as it sought to frame the founding of America as not starting in 1776 but in 1619, the year the first African slaves were brought to North America.
