I was honestly not expecting this.The race was 58.2 for Macron to 41.8% for Marine Le Pen. It might seem like a blowout, but it's getting closer. Here's a bit of French history.The Le Pen's have run for president every year since 1974 except one. They made it to the second round in 2002, 2017, and 2022. 1974: 0.75%1981: Did not run1988: 14.39%1995: 15%2002: 16.86%2007: 10.44%2012: 17.9%2017:  21%2022: 23%2002 was remarkable. It was the first time that a \"Far right\" party in France had made it to the second round since their 5th Republic was founded, in 1958. What happened? The whole country united against them. They only got 17.8% in the second round. 1% more than they got the first round.After 2007, the senior Le Pen stopped running and his daughter took over. In 2012 she did better than he did, but not enough to go the second round. In 2017 she was able to get the second round and not have the entire country unite against her. She still only got 1/3 of the vote. It was 33.9%-66.1% and after Le Pen advanced to the second round in 2022, I thought the results would be similar to 2017. She increased by nearly 8 percentage points. She's now very serious as the true opposition.What's even more remarkable, is that there was a Saboteur in the first round. A second far right candidate named Eric Zamour who was Jewish and Algerian and he ran to try to stop her from advancing to the second round because she stood a chance at winning.Things are chancing in France and everywhere else. What will happen in 2027?",

          "content": "As I continue my research into the functions behind the designs of the structures and buildings of the Old World, I begin to learn more about the realm we live in. In these discussions there is a large emphasis placed on the electromagnetic aspects of our universe, and less on another important factor- electrostatics. There is a large amount of electrostatic potential within our atmosphere that is going wholly unused at the moment. However, our ancient structures had the capabilities of harnessing this energy source. The first video provided discusses how the electrostatic potential contained in our atmosphere provides the downward vector that modern science attributes to gravity. The engineers of the late 1800’s to early 1900’s were working with this technology, and created engines and machines that scientists are still trying to fully comprehend today. The studies conducted on behalf of the Electric Universe realm of science are working to plug up many of the holes that have been created by embracing Einstein’s theories. These studies can help us to better understand the works of Maxwell, Heaviside, Tesla, and more. In return, it gives us another piece of the Old World puzzle that many are trying to reconstruct. If you look at the lecture given by Eric Dollard, he goes into great detail explaining these inventors and the work they were conducting. Although, I agree that these men were on the right track as far as understanding the electric potential of our universe, I think we do ourselves a disservice in thinking that they were first to come up with this technology. We know that there is nothing new under the sun. As we can see in the second video discussing the capabilities of the Old World to harvest our static electricity, and create a healthy environment for the inhabitants of their day. If you find the discussion on Holy Water fascinating, I would encourage you to check out the post that discusses Structured Water.

          "contentraw": "As I continue my research into the functions behind the designs of the structures and buildings of the Old World, I begin to learn more about the realm we live in. In these discussions there is a large emphasis placed on the electromagnetic aspects of our universe, and less on another important factor- electrostatics. <br /><br />There is a large amount of electrostatic potential within our atmosphere that is going wholly unused at the moment. However, our ancient structures had the capabilities of harnessing this energy source. The first video provided discusses how the electrostatic potential contained in our atmosphere provides the downward vector that modern science attributes to gravity. The engineers of the late 1800’s to early 1900’s were working with this technology, and created engines and machines that scientists are still trying to fully comprehend today. <br /><br />The studies conducted on behalf of the Electric Universe realm of science are working to plug up many of the holes that have been created by embracing Einstein’s theories. These studies can help us to better understand the works of Maxwell, Heaviside, Tesla, and more. In return, it gives us another piece of the Old World puzzle that many are trying to reconstruct. <br /><br />If you look at the lecture given by Eric Dollard, he goes into great detail explaining these inventors and the work they were conducting. Although, I agree that these men were on the right track as far as understanding the electric potential of our universe, I think we do ourselves a disservice in thinking that they were first to come up with this technology. We know that there is nothing new under the sun.

Trump played the trailer at the rally where he is campaigning with J.D. Vance, the candidate he endorsed for U.S. Senate in this year’s Ohio GOP Senate primary.The documentary, the product of a years-long investigation by election integrity group True The Vote and produced by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, has been long-awaited and is chock full of surveillance footage showing specific instances of people taking multiple ballots to drop boxes and making trips to several boxes around their states. The investigation has been anticipated since Breitbart News first revealed it last summer, and Trump has been hyping it for some time now in statements and commentary.WATCH: The trailer opens with a panel of Salem Radio Network hosts split on what happened in the 2020 election. Salem Media Group worked with D’Souza and True The Vote on the film, and the panel—which includes Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk and radio hosts Dennis Prager, Larry Elder, Eric Metaxas, and Dr. Sebastian Gorka—opens with them discussing how they, before viewing this evidence, were not sure what exactly happened in the 2020 election and were awaiting more evidence.Then the film cuts to True The Vote’s Catherine Engelbrecht who tells D’Souza, “We have been working on something big.”“I’ve been working with Gregg Phillips,” Engelbrecht says. “He has a deep background in election intelligence.”On screen, voters see Engelbrecht and Phillips breaking down the data and information that they have collected. “True The Vote has the largest store of election intelligence for the 2020 elections in the world,” Phillips says. “No one has more data than we do.”On-screen graphics tell viewers that True The Vote used cell phone GPS geo tracking data across the battleground states.“We identified in Atlanta 242 mules that went to an average of 24 drop boxes,” Phillips says. “In Philadelphia alone, we’ve identified more than 1,100 mules.”When D’Souza asked Engelbrecht to define a “mule,” she replies by saying they are a “person picking up ballots and running them to the drop boxes.”“This is not grandma out walking her dog,” Phillips says. “Bad backgrounds, bad reputations. They are interested in one thing: That’s money.”“In no shape, in no way, in no time is that legal,” Engelbrecht adds.“This is organized crime,” Phillips says.CONTINUE READING>>https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/04/23/trump-reveals-trailer-of-explosive-2000-mules-ballot-harvesting-documentary-at-ohio-rally/",
