We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, begging for followers or money, promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines)\r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

I think that it also is The Kingdom of Heaven Within, refered to by Jesus Christ, therefore it is the Union between Science and Christianity. It is God's Transcendent Universal Reason revealed as Enlightened Wisdom.\n\nIn this Denomination, in addition to standard Christian practices, one would attempt to figure out how observed scientific and logical data and classifications fit into conformance with The New Testament. So, we would look at the chapters that talked about a specific topic, and then work to make sense of the observed data by logical means, applied rigorously, to see how it may be in conformance with what is already written in The New Testament. That's the whole point. This group is intended to use Logic, rigorously, to look at science, archaeology, and other _hard data_ from a Christian perspective. \n\nIt is not about that airy-fairy New Age bullshit. When considering a hypothesis, language should be used to clarify that it is a hypothesis, merely. This isn't about creativity so much as processing and synthesizing data.\n\nAs an example of what I mean: The Story of The Flood has been corroborated by data in the last decade regarding a Meteor Impact on Greenland approximately 12,000 years ago, which would have melted a vast amount of ice, causing a global flood as the ocean level raised by possibly hundreds of feet, rapidly, in just weeks or months. Applying Logic to scientific data from a Christian perspective.\n\nThe New Testament, which I call The Christian Bible, is that which I keep covanents with, adhere to, and constantly seek to increase my understanding of. The Old Testament, being the Jewish Bible, is not, however. I know the Jewish Bible to not be a historically reliable source of information, most of the time, based on the evidence.",

It is God&#39;s Transcendent Universal Reason revealed as Enlightened Wisdom.<\/p><p>In this Denomination, in addition to standard Christian practices, one would attempt to figure out how observed scientific and logical data and classifications fit into conformance with The New Testament. So, we would look at the chapters that talked about a specific topic, and then work to make sense of the observed data by logical means, applied rigorously, to see how it may be in conformance with what is already written in The New Testament. That&#39;s the whole point. This group is intended to use Logic, rigorously, to look at science, archaeology, and other <u>hard data<\/u> from a Christian perspective. <\/p><p>It is not about that airy-fairy New Age bullshit. When considering a hypothesis, language should be used to clarify that it is a hypothesis, merely. This isn&#39;t about creativity so much as processing and synthesizing data.<\/p><p>As an example of what I mean: The Story of The Flood has been corroborated by data in the last decade regarding a Meteor Impact on Greenland approximately 12,000 years ago, which would have melted a vast amount of ice, causing a global flood as the ocean level raised by possibly hundreds of feet, rapidly, in just weeks or months. Applying Logic to scientific data from a Christian perspective.<\/p><p>The New Testament, which I call The Christian Bible, is that which I keep covanents with, adhere to, and constantly seek to increase my understanding of. The Old Testament, being the Jewish Bible, is not, however. I know the Jewish Bible to not be a historically reliable source of information, most of the time, based on the evidence.<\/p>",

Thus, when the sinner frustrates grace by resisting grace, the Lord God that weighs the actions of man, frustrates the aspirations of sinners and resists the proud.The righteous flow with the Spirit and resist not the grace of God for we know that grace is the power that sustains our faith even our soul.Through contact with Jesus, we put our efforts into building the house of God after the blueprint given to the steward of this season, Apostle Eric, even as God gave the blueprint for the tabernacle to Moses who oversaw this construction work, likewise, those in the house of Eva are building God's house under close supervision and oversight of God's steward in this Second 8th Week.God did not change but man's heart has changed towards God.

            "description": "Building-up our most holy faith with testimonies, from saints of old & saints today, scripture, etc. Ministry of the Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit, FILL THIS PLACE & FILL US! MOVE FREELY, COME LORD! IN JESUS NAME. WE WANT YOU GOD! Precious Holy Spirit, have your way. We surrender to who you are. \n\n1 Cor. 12:27-31\nYou, then, are the body of Christ. Every one of you is a member of it. Furthermore, God has set-up in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle-workers, healers, assistants, administrators, and those who speak in tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles or have the gift of healing? Do all speak in tongues, all have the gift of interpretation of tongues? Set your hearts on the greater gifts.\n1 Cor. 13:1-13 \nNow I will show you the way which surpasses all the others. If I speak with human tongues and Angelic as well, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal, if I have the gift of Prophecy and, with full knowledge, comprehend all Mysteries, if I have faith great enough to move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give everything I have to feed the poor and hand over my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient; love is kind. Love is not jealous, it does not put on airs, it is not snobbish. Love is never rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not prone to anger; neither does it brood over injuries. Love does not rejoice in what is wrong but rejoices with the truth. There is no limit to Love's forbearance, to its trust, it's hope, its power to endure. Love Never Fails. Prophecies will cease, tongues will be silent, knowledge will pass away. Our knowledge is imperfect and our prophesying is imperfect. When the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away. When I was a child I used to talk like a child, think like a child, reason like a child. When I became a man I put childish ways aside. Now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. My knowledge is imperfect now; then I shall know even as I am known. There are in the end three things that last: faith, hope, and love, and the greatest of these is love.",

Der Krieg ist nichts als ein erweiterter Zweikampf. Wollen wir uns die Unzahl der einzelnen Zweikämpfe, aus denen er besteht, als Einheit denken, so tun wir besser, uns zwei Ringende vorzustellen. Jeder sucht den anderen durch physische Gewalt zur Erfüllung seines Willens zu zwingen; sein nächster Zweck ist, den Gegner niederzuwerfen und dadurch zu jedem ferneren Widerstand unfähig zu machen. Der Krieg ist also ein Akt der Gewalt, um den Gegner zur Erfüllung unseres Willens zu zwingen. Die Gewalt rüstet sich mit den Erfindungen der Künste und Wissenschaften aus, um der Gewalt zu begegnen. Unmerkliche, kaum nennenswerte Beschränkungen, die sie sich selbst setzt unter dem Namen völkerrechtlicher Sitte, begleiten sie, ohne ihre Kraft wesentlich zu schwächen. Gewalt, d. h. die physische Gewalt (denn eine moralische gibt es außer dem Begriffe des Staates und Gesetzes nicht), ist also das Mittel, dem Feinde unseren Willen aufzudringen, der Zweck. Um diesen Zweck sicher zu erreichen, müssen wir den Feind wehrlos machen, und dies ist dem Begriff nach das eigentliche Ziel der kriegerischen Handlung. Es vertritt den Zweck und verdrängt ihn gewissermaßen als etwas nicht zum Kriege selbst Gehöriges.“ (Carl von Clausewitz, „Vom Kriege“)",

Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture…EVER. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on.(SIDE NOTE: Both the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.)The wrong “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.)Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm ) is only qualified to teach the new covenant (see 2 Corinthians 3:4-11 for more information). Forever’s a long time.Praying it all helps!",

HUMONGOUS difference.)<br />Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord).<br /><br />By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>biblehub.com/greek/509.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> ) is only qualified to teach the new covenant (see 2 Corinthians 3:4-11 for more information). Forever’s a long time.<br /><br />Praying it all helps!",
