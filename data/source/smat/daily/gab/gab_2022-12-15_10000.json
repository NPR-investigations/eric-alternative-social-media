However, we don't laugh much anymore because proving all things has led us to discover they were right and the whole world has been deceived. It sounds crazy and I would've never thought that a scientific investigation could prove that the wisdom of this world I grew up loving was wrong. This is why the Word tells us the wisdom of this world is foolishness to our Father. Discovering  the truth about creation isn't the truth that sets you free, but it has led many to that truth and continues to do so. It's a powerful movement and we challenge you to defend your own beliefs without bias. You will have many questions and we will use this channel to answer those questions. ",

In Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Wyoming, the attorney general is a gubernatorial appointee. The attorney general in Tennessee is appointed by the Tennessee Supreme Court for an eight-year term. In Maine, the attorney general is elected by the state Legislature for a two-year term.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general\n\nThe District of Columbia and two U.S. territories, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, elect their attorneys general for a four-year term. 2014 marked the first year that the District of Columbia and Northern Mariana Islands held an election for the office. In American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the attorney general is appointed by the governor. In Puerto Rico, the attorney general is officially called the secretary of justice, but is commonly known as the Puerto Rico attorney general.\n",
