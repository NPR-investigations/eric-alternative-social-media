Due to the nature of this group, we are consistently attacked by our enemies who are currently committing genocide on all White people! So this is why we have many admins here. There are only three very simple rules here. So please follow them if you do not want your post to be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1) No Fedposting. http://fedposter.urbanup.com/13949294#.YGSfV3BTnpI.twitter2) No infighting or better yet provoking it. We already have enough enemies out there.3)No insulting the Fuhrer and/or degrading him in any way. This includes insulting or degrading the Swastika or anything National Socialist related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          No one will be removed for violating any of these two rules but any attack on the group, its admins. and/or its members is a reason for removal. That much is obvious!

Just in case something goes wrong with Gab. We are hoping to add more backup groups here so if you have a similar group outside of Gab. Let us know and we will add it here. We can never have too many backup groups.

Throughout all of history man has always known our Earth was Level and Stationary, until gov't education and #FakeNewsMedia. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations, taking our beliefs further and further from our True Earth. When we were to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed society with false beliefs. All our oceans and lakes do survey and measure perfectly FLAT, no Curvature has ever been found or measured. Our Level Earth is Stationary, no instrument known to man has ever detected any motion on Earth. Every single Star ever seen, from anywhere on Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, rather it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. The \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us, more lands beyond ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned, wrong place. Accounts set to 'Private', dis-info shills, controlled opposition, alt accounts, ban evaders and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. We report spammers. This group has never, and never will, ask for a single dime from anyone. The ONLY purpose for this group is to reveal the facts supporting Flat Earth, with the undeniable evidence proving our Level and Stationary Earth. The Truth will break you free of the Echo Chamber of Deception.",

We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ?

An excellent, dramatic doomsday scenario in which the Cold War fully escalates. \"Looking Glass\" is the code word for the Strategic Air Command's control plane which is to be used in the case of nuclear war.A Canadian made-for-television movie, and the narrative of the film details the events that lead up to the initial exchange of nuclear weapons, which was triggered by a banking crisis, from the perspective of an ongoing news broadcast.The nuclear powered aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz portrayed in this movie is actually the museum ship U.S.S. Yorktown (ex CV 10) moored in Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina.  Starring Scott Glenn, Michael Murphy, Helen Shaver as Dorian Waldorf, Eric Sevareid (as himself) and a young Newt Gingrich (as himself).First aired on October 14, 1984.

          "contentraw": "\"Countdown To Looking Glass\" (1984) Cold-War USSR Nuclear Attack Film <br /><br />Docudrama uses fictional reports of a crisis in the Middle East, which leads to a nuclear confrontation between the US and the USSR.  The story is told through a live news report that follows the apocalyptic world-ending nuclear exchange.  An excellent, dramatic doomsday scenario in which the Cold War fully escalates. \"Looking Glass\" is the code word for the Strategic Air Command's control plane which is to be used in the case of nuclear war.<br /><br />A Canadian made-for-television movie, and the narrative of the film details the events that lead up to the initial exchange of nuclear weapons, which was triggered by a banking crisis, from the perspective of an ongoing news broadcast.<br /><br />The nuclear powered aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz portrayed in this movie is actually the museum ship U.S.S. Yorktown (ex CV 10) moored in Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina.  Starring Scott Glenn, Michael Murphy, Helen Shaver as Dorian Waldorf, Eric Sevareid (as himself) and a young Newt Gingrich (as himself).<br /><br />First aired on October 14, 1984.

We are dealing with a humanitarian crisis that was created by human hands.”Earlier in the news conference, he said, “This is not a shelter issue. This is a humanitarian, refugee, migrant crisis.”By differentiating between homelessness and migration, Adams could be staking out a legal framework for why the city should be able to skirt the right-to-shelter law when it comes to housing the thousands of migrants who have arrived in the city in recent months after crossing into the U.S. from Mexico in hopes of seeking asylum.New York City Mayor Eric Adamshttps://gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748Contact:http://ericadams2021.comhttps://www.facebook.com/80559174013https://www.instagram.com/ericadamsfornycPeople in PoliticsPage 1 https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087",

A temporary place for people to work towards creating a living wage trade.<\/p><p>President Trump created 8,700 Opportunity Zones, largely in low-income minority neighborhoods.
