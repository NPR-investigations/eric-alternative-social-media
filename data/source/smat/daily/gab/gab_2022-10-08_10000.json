The Financial Post reported on Oct. 5 that the Netherlands has paused the project due to “changed priorities” and quoted Dutch Migration Minister Eric van der Burg saying “There are currently no concrete plans to implement the KTDI pilot.”       Transport Canada says the program by design would allow travellers to opt in and out.       “However, proposed information to be shared will include elements derived from the ePassport used for the pilot,” says Transport Canada.       The ePassport is a biometric passport with an electronic chip encoded with the holder’s biodata and his digital picture.        The WEF KTDI paper says the Canadian government did test a technology: “The Government of Canada, in collaboration with Accenture, completed the testing of an interdepartmental government blockchain-based digital identity management platform in a simulated environment.”",

We need help from the federal government. We ned help from the state of New York. Our city is doing our part and now others must step up and join us ….

Finally, we need a bipartisan effort to deliver long awaited immigration reform.“We expect to spend at least $1 billion by the end of the fiscal year on this crisis, all because we have a functional and compassionate system,” he said.Now here comes the Juicy Details on Why and Who is behind this Open Border Policy \"BullSchiff\".The demand was $500 million two weeks ago, as officials counted the cost of housing migrants who are being drawn to the free overnight shelters attracted to the jobs and schooling in the so-called “sanctuary city.”City leaders want more migrants because they help to cut wages, inflate real-estate rents and values and boost profit for local business leaders.The policy also generates many customers for the city’s welfare, aid, housing, education, and medical agencies. For example, Adams admitted in his speech that the city is providing overnight shelters to 61,000 homeless people each night, and is adding 5,500 migrant children to the overcrowded and failing schools needed by non-wealthy Americans in the city.The cheap-labor migrants also provide more profits for investors in the city businesses. Without the extra labor, the investors otherwise would be forced to hire unemployed Americans in upstate New York cities, or other states such as New Jersey, Maine, New Hampshire, and West Virginia.Overall, the Biden migrants being welcomed by Adams allow the city’s Democratic leaders to preserve their high/low economy, where a small number of wealthy landlords and investors keep political power amid a fractured city of divided, diverse, distracted, and poor voters.",

We need help from the federal government. We ned help from the state of New York. Our city is doing our part and now others must step up and join us …. We need those to come through.Adams also demanded preferential treatment from legislators nationwide:We need legislation that will allow these asylum seekers to legally work now, not the six months … We need a coordinated effort to move asylum-seekers to other cities in this country to ensure everyone is doing their part and Congress must pass emergency financial relief for our city and others. Finally, we need a bipartisan effort to deliver long awaited immigration reform.“We expect to spend at least $1 billion by the end of the fiscal year on this crisis, all because we have a functional and compassionate system,” he said.Now here comes the Juicy Details on Why and Who is behind this Open Border Policy \"BullSchiff\".The demand was $500 million two weeks ago, as officials counted the cost of housing migrants who are being drawn to the free overnight shelters attracted to the jobs and schooling in the so-called “sanctuary city.”City leaders want more migrants because they help to cut wages, inflate real-estate rents and values and boost profit for local business leaders.The policy also generates many customers for the city’s welfare, aid, housing, education, and medical agencies. For example, Adams admitted in his speech that the city is providing overnight shelters to 61,000 homeless people each night, and is adding 5,500 migrant children to the overcrowded and failing schools needed by non-wealthy Americans in the city.The cheap-labor migrants also provide more profits for investors in the city businesses. Without the extra labor, the investors otherwise would be forced to hire unemployed Americans in upstate New York cities, or other states such as New Jersey, Maine, New Hampshire, and West Virginia.Overall, the Biden migrants being welcomed by Adams allow the city’s Democratic leaders to preserve their high/low economy, where a small number of wealthy landlords and investors keep political power amid a fractured city of divided, diverse, distracted, and poor voters.",
