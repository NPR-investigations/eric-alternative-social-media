            "description": "Sustainable Living\r\nFederalized housing and zoning codes. \r\nThis is tied in with immigration and global warming.\r\nAs the Democrats import more and more illiterate immigrants, they need housing.\r\nHistorically, immigrants tend to live in neighborhoods of people with similar cultures.\r\nAmerica's melting pot becomes a salad bowl.\r\nIn the 90s the liberals bussed our children to violent neighborhoods and violent kids to nice neighborhoods. These were mostly Black and White.\r\nWhen the families moved to better school districts it left the liberal cities a void.\r\nThat void was filled with illegal aliens.\r\nThis created inequalities and segregation. \r\nIt also led to drive-by-shootings and violence in the schools. \r\nGang wars pitted the immigrants against one another and blacks.\r\nTeachers wouldn't teach in violent cities and left those kids to be educated by subpar teachers.\r\n\r\nClimate alarmism was created by the United Nations and introduced to congress by Nancy Pelosi in 1992 as Agenda 21.\r\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/353\r\nThe United Nations wants to be unelected global leaders with open borders.\r\nPelosi made her open borders stance clear when in 2016 she flew to Mexico City and got former\r\nMexico President Vicente Fox to declare Trump voters as \"lazy drunks\".\r\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/pelosi-vicente-fox-plot-to-defeat-trump-mexican-calls-trump-voters-lazy-drunks\r\n\r\nCalifornia's Governor Newsom within a week after defending his recall, made a law by decree that every neighborhood would have to provide affordable housing. With low income high density housing comes public transportation, light rail, dedicated bus lanes, bicycle trails, removing lanes from streets.\r\n\r\nAgenda 21 envisioned returning land back to nature, which explains Obama's and Biden's land grab. \r\n\r\nObama:\r\nSince taking office, I’ve set aside more than 260 million acres of public lands and waters — more than any President in history.\r\nhttp://news.investors.com/politics-andrew-malcolm/102415-777311-obama-protecting-the-land-is-important.htm\r\n\r\nUnder guise of climate change, Biden wants to make 30% of U.S. land off limits Expanded government plan means he's coming for private property\r\nhttps://www.wnd.com/2021/09/biden-plan-means-coming-private-property-wants-make-30-us-land-off-limits/\r\n",
