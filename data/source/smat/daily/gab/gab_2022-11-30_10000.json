Recognizing a potential niche, left wing activists created ERIC to clean voter rolls their way, using their rules. So in 2012 the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) was formed as a membership organization primarily for blue States. ERIC is essentially a left wing voter registration drive disguised as voter roll clean up. But it‚Äôs been gaining traction in Red States too. Originally funded by the Soros Open Society, it is now responsible for cleaning the voter rolls in 31 States, plus D.C. A top election official from each member State is appointed a seat on the ERIC Board or as an Officer, all unpaid positions.<br /><br />ERIC located 17 million new voters for the 2020 election, the most in the history of their organization. For comparison, they only found 5.7 million in 2012, Obama‚Äôs reelection.<br /><br />The ERIC database is comprehensive and would be one of the most coveted by bad actors looking to influence an election. Member States must not only submit all details on inactive and active voters to ERIC every 60 days. But they must also provide every individual in their states Motor Vehicle Department database, both licensed and ID recipients. This combo of data is breathtaking. It‚Äôs everyone who could generate a legal ballot. It includes those approaching voting age, even those here illegally yet issued an ID by their left leaning State. This data includes names, addresses, DOB, License #, last 4 of social #, voter activity, phone, email, title and type of citizenship documentation, and much more!<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/11/820222/?utm_source=Email&amp;utm_medium=the-gateway-pundit&amp;utm_campaign=dailyam&amp;utm_content=2022-11-30\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>thegatewaypundit.com/2022/11/820222/?utm_sour<span class=\"invisible\">ce=Email&amp;utm_medium=the-gateway-pundit&amp;utm_campaign=dailyam&amp;utm_content=2022-11-30<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180¬∞ opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Over the course of my tenure, we have overcome challenges and accomplished so many great things that support the professional workforce in Indiana. I am proud to say that forward planning has implemented changes that prepare the agency for the next several years. None of that would be possible without Governor Holcomb‚Äôs strong leadership, and vision for Indiana.‚Äù\n\nFrye‚Äôs last day is Friday, Dec. 2, 2022.\n\nLindsay Hyer worked as the chief of staff for Indiana Secretary of State Holli Sullivan where she served as the senior advisor and oversaw all financial and operating activities for the office. Hyer managed the growth of the customer-friendly portal, INBiz, Indiana‚Äôs one-stop resource for registering and managing businesses to ensure that they are compliant with state laws and regulations.

Holcomb. ‚ÄúLindsay will use her skills to truly make a positive impact in the workforce.‚Äù\n\nBefore her role with the Secretary of State‚Äôs office, Hyer worked for the Indiana Alcohol & Tobacco Commission (ATC) as general counsel, where she oversaw the licensing and regulation of Indiana‚Äôs alcohol permittees.

(Related: Fauci‚Äôs net worth more than tripled during the plandemic.)<br /><br />‚ÄúIn Feb. ‚Äô20 he emailed a friend advising her masks were ineffective,‚Äù Schmitt said in a tweet. ‚ÄúConfirmed again on Mar. 31.

            "description": "What If Everything You Were Ever Taught Was A Lie?\r\n\r\nThere is a war going on right now and it doesn‚Äôt involve guns or the military industrial complex.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs a war on consciousness and most people are clueless that it even exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation or Indoctrination?\r\n\r\nUltimately, the education system can be blamed for feeding us propaganda and forcing us to regurgitate it so we can ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with the rest of society. Our public school systems are set up to get the students primed for economic slavery without ever offering courses that allow to students to think creatively or freely.\r\n\r\nIf you trace the company‚Äôs who print our children‚Äôs textbooks, you‚Äôll find a Zionist agenda behind them all. For example, George W. Bush‚Äôs grandfather, Prescott Bush, was arrested for funding both sides of World War II, yet we never learned this in school. Why? Because had we learned this, NEITHER Bush would have been elected president for having a traitor in their lineage.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, Christopher Columbus didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù America.\r\n\r\nGranted some things that we learn in school are the truth, such as math, music and some science but our TRUE history has been kept from us for reasons of subservience, control and conformity.\r\n\r\nhttp://themindunleashed.com/2014/03/everything-ever-taught-lie.html\r\n\r\nIn all forms of education, there are still perpetual references to ‚Äúfossil fuels‚Äù including at the college level. How ridiculous is this? Oil is abiotic, which means it replenishes itself, yet we are draining the planet of a lubricant that serves no other interests other than economic.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the late 1980‚Äôs, Stanley Meyer invented a car that could go from coast to coast in the United States on 21 gallons of water. He was offered $1 billion from the automobile industry for his invention but turned it down because he wanted this idea to go to the people. Shortly afterwards, he was poisoned to death and the invention has been hidden from us ever since, yet our children are not learning about inventors such as Meyer in school, nor are they being encouraged to develop alternate fuel sources.",
