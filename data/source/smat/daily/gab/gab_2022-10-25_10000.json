Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

One case charge's seven Chinese nationals with trying to forcefully repatriate a Chinese national. Four others were charged with targeting people in the U.S. to act on China's behalf. And two other men were charged with interfering in a U.S. criminal prosecution of a global telecommunications company.The Justice Department did not name the company involved in the third case. The details of the complaint against the defendants, Guochun He and Zheng Wang, match up with a prosecution in the Eastern District of New York of Huawei, a Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer, which the U.S. previously charged with stealing trade secret and intellectual property information.The complaint accused the pair of trying to recruit an unnamed informant whom they paid $61,000 in Bitcoin in exchange for what they believed was confidential information about the Justice Department’s investigation and prosecution of the company. Asked Monday whether Huawei had any connection to He or Wang, a Justice Department official declined to confirm the identity of the company in the complaint.Garland said: “As these cases demonstrate, the government of China sought to interfere with the rights and freedoms of individuals in the United States and to undermine our judicial system that protects those rights. They did not succeed. The Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by any foreign power to undermine the rule of law upon which our democracy is based.”Garland was joined by Deputy Attorney General Lisa O.

It’s a late assessment of the ‘unknown’ “safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the mRNA-1273 coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine in young children”. It’s not even funny how they are publishing this assessment of unknown safety factors 4 months AFTER they starting injecting children ages 6 months to 5 years of age. I have been bitching about this for a long time now.This is just another stunning example of how Eric Rubin really wasn’t kidding around when he publicly announced that ‘we won’t know how safe these products are until we start putting them into babies (people)”. Maybe this is just the way it goes now, eh? Funny how this guy is the Editor-in-Chief of this very journal.So the following is just some of what they buried in the Supplementary Appendix. I literally just glanced at it and found a few things that made me wince.The first thing I want to point out is a strange mis-use of the word ‘place-bo’ in the Trial Vaccine description on page 11. At first glance I thought, well this must be the result of the word ‘placebo’ previously having been spliced due to word spacing/processing - say, from having been sourced from another document.https://jessicar.substack.com/p/i-guess-i-should-also-take-a-crack?utm_campaign=post",

Mayor Eric Adams “made a different decision for similarly situated people based on identical facts” in his Executive Order No. 62, the judge wrote.The ruling noted that 15 of the 16 petitioners were denied exemptions after receiving “generalized and vague denials.” Porzio ruled that there was “no reason” why they couldn’t have been allowed to work while their exemption requests were being processed.“There was no reason why the City of New York could not continue with a vaccinate or test policy, like the Mayor’s Executive Order that was issued in August 2021,” the judge wrote.“It is clear that the Health Commissioner has the authority to issue public health mandates. No one is refuting that authority. However, the Health Commissioner cannot create a new condition of employment for City employees,” Porzio said in his ruling.The judge went on to point out the fact that COVID-19 vaccination does not stop the virus from spreading. He also quoted President Biden’s interview with 60 minutes in which he said “the pandemic is over.”Porzio also noted that New York City terminated its COVID-19 emergency declaration over a month ago. “If it was about safety and public health, the Health Commissioner would have issued city-wide mandates for vaccination for all residents. In a City with a nearly 80 percent vaccination rate, we shouldn’t be penalizing the people who showed up to work, at great risk to themselves and their families, while we were locked down,” the judge continued in his ruling.'  https://nationalfile.com/ny-supreme-court-strikes-down-nyc-worker-vax-mandate/",

We are literally a living bridge between the Higher Realms and the planet and each other. The Doorway to that Bridge is our Hearts. Our physical bodies hold our Hearts, which bring the Energies in, which move through us and through our Chakras, but the channel needs to be fully open. If we don't remember to move the energy all the way through, we get tummy aches. lolThose Energies need to move And we are the ones who move Them. Usually something will manifest physically if I am not remembering to Ground, which is why I'm sharing this, Beloveds. Tummy aches over here; moving through it. We are in this together.Remember that it is ok to reach out and ask for help or a hand to hold onto; there are Strong and Lovely Souls here who will walk beside you. Know that you are Seen and Loved, Deeply.  Importance of Grounding:\"So if you are wondering why at times you are having difficulty experiencing higher states of consciousness, or bringing more energy in, perhaps you need to look at your grounding. You can only absorb a certain amount of spiritual energy if you are not an open conduit allowing it to flow through. It will become stagnant if it does not flow through you. And one of the ways its longs to flow through you is through your legs into the Earth, to connect you with the Earth so that you can feel more smoothness in the flow of energy. If you have experiences in meditation or your channeling of feeling a little bit \"over-amped\" this is due in large part to not being fully grounded. When you are grounded you can bring through vast amounts of energy, vast amounts of spiritual presence, and not feel overwhelmed by it.

The large-scale legal action by the RNC comes after widespread accusations of voter fraud in the 2020 election cycle, which many believe was enough to swing the results away from President Donald J. Trump and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel described the 2022 election cycle as the “most litigious” in modern history, with many of the lawsuits directly targeting Democratic secretaries of state and other election officials who unilaterally changed their states’ election procedures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. These changes, which included expanded access to mail-in voting, ballot-harvesting by third parties, longer early voting periods, and the implementation of ballot drop boxes, all led to practices that are more susceptible to voter fraud.RNC spokesman Gates McGavick described the lawsuits as the result of a “multimillion-dollar investment into building an election integrity operations infrastructure that draws on its legal, political, data and communications resources.”The lawsuits were welcomed by election integrity advocates.“After the shortcomings of the last election, a proactive and preemptive legal strategy is critical to the election integrity voters deserve in 2022, 2024 and beyond,” said Michael Bars, executive director of the Election Transparency Initiative, further adding that there have been “significant strides” that have “restored voters’ faith in fair and secure elections.”Some of the most recent legal victories as a result of these lawsuits include successful efforts in Nevada and Arziona to force the state governments to produce data on all poll workers. In Michigan, the RNC won a lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D-Mich.) over her attempts to impose severe and unconstitutional restrictions on people who are appointed as poll-challengers.And in Pennsylvania, the state supreme court has agreed to hear a case regarding undated mail-in ballots, to determine whether such ballots should be counted in the election.",

          "content": "The Person with Dirty Duds: (James 1:27)“Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being unstained(polluted) by the world.”James describes that the ‘kind of religion’ matters is one that is outwardly active and inwardly holy. He presents a faith that looks and sounds like Jesus, someone who's head, heart and hands are devoted to God in purity, action and truth.  Martin Luther said that when it comes to Religion: “The world needs not a definition, but a demonstration.”James reminds us that faith in Jesus, is recognizable by the way one talks and walks. “Pure and undefiled” religion in the sight of God is the one that has its heart and hands open towards the most defenseless in one’s community. In his time and in most cultures, it was those without father or husband, orphans and widows. James says this, because James saw this in Jesus. One of the key words that prevents anyone from escaping the mirror here, is the word: visit. Visit them. That is the Jesus way. GO. Do something about it. Stop talking and praying and go help someone. Religious people love to talk...but often forget to visit. James also draws on one last image...someone who is walking around, all dressed up, maybe a bride about to present herself to her groom, or maybe someone entering a job interview in their nicest suit..but to everyone’s shock, they show up with their clothes...stained. Stained, is a word image that James grabs from some very unsavory imagery from life. The old Testaments prophets loved to use. Words like “defiled, sullied, spotted, stained, dirty, unclean’ have all kinds of day to day life examples. They are words are ripped right out of the exam room, the bathroom, laundry room and the bedroom. They are vivid images meant to shock us into seeing that our internal lives and external lives should match. God sees our sins like a hotel room bed under an ultraviolet light. Our inner lives, our thought life, our private life, our Google history, our internal talk, the atmosphere of our mind. All these things matter, and those who are seeking to walk out ‘true religion’ understand that justice matters and holiness matters to God. They are in union and reflect a life being transformed by the Holy Spirit and the Word of God. Small actions of care and compassion add up to a life lived in love. Small compromises with sin add up to a defiled life of faith. The Fallen Tree: What happens on the inside is what matters most:“After a violent storm one night, a large tree, which over the years had become a stately giant, was found lying across the pathway in a park. Nothing but a splintered stump was left. Closer examination showed that is was rotten at the core because thousands of tiny insects had eaten away at its heart. The weakness of that tree was not brought on by the sudden storm; it began the very moment the first insect nested within its bark. “Let’s heed the words of James and abandon...worthless religion. Let’s follow Jesus in living an active faith before God and the world.\" Pastor Eric Blauer-excerpt from my sermon on James chapter one, part 2. http://www.jacobswellspokane.com/?p=1304",

            "description": "Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I’m @shooglenifty.\r\n\r\nGod is good and His mercy endures forever!\r\n***\r\nBy posting you are agreeing to our posting standards. We will remove a post that doesn't follow the guidelines below.\r\n***\r\nMy hopes for the group is to foster phileo between the Christian diaspora that has chosen to join this group. We want to be a place where unbelievers come for answers and believers come to be bolstered in their faith. By the grace of God through the blood of Jesus we will bring His love to multitudes. My reasoning? I believe this: \"Never doubt God’s mighty power to work in you and accomplish all this. He will achieve infinitely more than your greatest request, your most unbelievable dream, and exceed your wildest imagination! He will outdo them all, for his miraculous power constantly energizes you.”Ephesians 3:20 TPT\r\n***\r\nPLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING:\r\nPosts that are encouraged (think ENGAGEMENT! and WHAT IS GOD TELLING YOU!):\r\n1. Testimonies, praise reports, prayer requests, encouragements, prophecies, words from God, exhortations, etc.\r\n2. Questions of those looking to our community for answers that only God can give.\r\n3. Sermons, articles, videos, pictures and verses as long as they have a good description outlining who, what, where, why and how. If you don't respect the link you are posting or the other Christians in the group enough to take some time with your post, please don't post it. \r\n***\r\nIt seems most just post and run (seagull posting) and this is not God's heart nor mine. This group has ONE timeline. It also has many members. Is it respectful on your part to post several one line posts in a row pushing someone else's well thought post or plea out of sight of the group? With that in mind the following types of posts will be removed at the sole discretion of the moderators:\r\n1. Off topic posts: politics, flat earth, begging for followers or money (please reach out to the admin if you believe you have a worthy fundraising cause. You will be required to provide proof and cause. Any fundraiser posted without prior discussion will be removed), promoting personal agendas, etc.\r\n2. Intentionally divisive, disrespectful or racist posts\r\n3. Low effort (Just posting a video/link is not sufficient within the group, you must also write YOUR OWN description of the link/video; the included video/link description is not acceptable) or multiple posts in a row (limit of 2 posts per 3 hours)\r\n4. Posts that don't meet the criteria mentioned above\r\n5. Any reposts from other groups that are unrelated to Christianity; reposts of posts already in the group timeline (if you agree with a post just say it in the original post); and any reposts of your disagreements within a post brought to the group timeline.\r\n6. Anyone who spams the same post to multiple groups (yes, I check timelines), or continually posts the same post/s in the timeline. \r\n7. All members who block the administrators and moderators will be removed.\r\n***\r\nRemember that we are the body of Christ. Please keep your posts in line with Philippians 4:8 (ESV): Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think (post!) about these things.\r\n***\r\n“The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.””Numbers 6:24-27 ESV",

They are words are ripped right out of the exam room, the bathroom, laundry room and the bedroom. They are vivid images meant to shock us into seeing that our internal lives and external lives should match. God sees our sins like a hotel room bed under an ultraviolet light.<br /> <br />Our inner lives, our thought life, our private life, our Google history, our internal talk, the atmosphere of our mind. All these things matter, and those who are seeking to walk out ‘true religion’ understand that justice matters and holiness matters to God. They are in union and reflect a life being transformed by the Holy Spirit and the Word of God.<br /> <br />Small actions of care and compassion add up to a life lived in love. <br />Small compromises with sin add up to a defiled life of faith. <br /><br />The Fallen Tree: <br />What happens on the inside is what matters most:<br />“After a violent storm one night, a large tree, which over the years had become a stately giant, was found lying across the pathway in a park. Nothing but a splintered stump was left. Closer examination showed that is was rotten at the core because thousands of tiny insects had eaten away at its heart. The weakness of that tree was not brought on by the sudden storm; it began the very moment the first insect nested within its bark. “<br />Let’s heed the words of James and abandon...worthless religion. Let’s follow Jesus in living an active faith before God and the world.\" Pastor Eric Blauer<br /><br />-excerpt from my sermon on James chapter one, part 2. <a href=\"http://www.jacobswellspokane.com/?p=1304\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://www.<\/span>jacobswellspokane.com/?p=1304<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

The seven others — one man and six women — were chosen to sit on the panel.“I really, really don’t like Trump at all. I hate him,” said one woman, who was later dismissed.Another potential panelist said she thought Trump “has no morals” and “is a criminal” — but insisted she could still be unbiased.“I think he has done irreparable damage to this country,” she said, “and that’s exactly why I think I could be impartial because the issues here and everything Mr. Trump has done here is trivial.” The attorneys didn’t buy it.A number of prospective jurors in the Trump Organization tax fraud case have openly admitted they despise former President Donald Trump.Getty ImagesThe 32-question jury form includes two queries directly related to Trump, including whether the prospects have any “strong opinions” of the ex-president, and if the opinions would prevent them from being “fair and impartial.”Despite openly admitting they hate the Republican, many prospective jurors claimed they could still be unbiased.“I’ll definitely pledge to do that [be fair] if I am on the jury,” a woman in her 50s said before adding: “I mean I can’t deny it, I really, really don’t like Trump at all.”Asked if she hated Trump, the woman continued: “Yes, I hate him. If he was here on trial, I couldn’t be fair.”Trump, 76, hasn’t been charged, though he could possibly be called to testify — and jurors are likely to hear his name throughout the trial. His namesake family business stands accused of helping top executives avoid income taxes on job perks such as rent-free apartments and luxury cars.Justice Juan Manuel Merchan, as well as attorneys for the Trump Org, have indicated they hope to have a jury decided on by Friday. The trial is anticipated to last at least a month once the panel is seated.Among the few to be selected Tuesday was a female book editor who said she didn’t vote for Trump, but insisted she could remain unbiased during the trial.“I would have gone for different Supreme Court justices, but I really do know I can be fair and unbiased sitting in a courtroom listening to evidence and different witnesses,” she said.Seventy prospective jurors were already dismissed Monday, including some who had asked to be excused because they knew they couldn’t be fair in a trial related to the former commander-in-chief.The process to select five more jurors, as well as six alternates, is still ongoing.The case will largely hinge on the government’s star witness, longtime Trump Org chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty in August to fraudulently accepting $1.7 million under the table from the company.Trump had transferred ownership of his company to Weisselberg and his adult children — Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump — when he was elected president in 2017.The three Trump kids are also on the list of potential witnesses.",
