            "description": "Rest In Peace Maxim Martsinkevich, May 8th 1984 - September 16th 2020, murdered in custody before his trial by \"Based Putin's\" security apparatus. Maxim had previously received a 3 and a 5 year sentence (the latter later reduced to 34 months) for making racist videos.\n\nAsk Russian National Socialists what they think of Putin and the Kremlin. They look on the Kremlin as you look on the Pentagon. In America you can legally Sieg Heil and be a National Socialist, ostensibly at the least. In Russia the state will sentence you to years in prison and then murder you.\n\nI respect the hell out of Russian National Socialists, but Russia and the Putin regime is an Asiatic empire ran by orthodox jews and antifa sympathizers, who HATE Fascism. Don't believe me? Ask Russian National Socialists, if you know any.\n\nMultiple Russian National Socialists have told me they firmly believe Putin is a jew via his mother. I don't know if it's true, but it's something a lot of Russian NS firmly believe. What can't be doubted is Putin grew up in a jewish area, his father served in an NKVD Destruction Battalion, one of his brother's died during the Siege of Leningrad, his uncles died during Barbarossa, and Russian National Socialists are persecuted in Russia and Belarus even more than in America. Russian and Belarussian NS often join Baltic and Slavic NS crews, if they are accepted, to try and avoid being tortured and murdered by their government. Those who remain in Russia and are open National Socialists experience a level of persecution by the state unlike anything any other National Socialist in the Western world endures, be it in America, the UK, Sweden, or anywhere else. \n\nIf you wish to learn more about the most famous/infamous Russian National Socialist to date, I shall link an article about him directly below by a Polish National Socialist which was translated (poorly) into English. If you wonder why he refers to Tesak as Polish and \"our Polish skinhead\", Tesak was of Russian, Polish, and Lithuanian, among perhaps one or two other White ethnic groups, ancestry.\n\nhttps://telegra.ph/On-the-death-of-Maxim-Martsinkevich-06-14\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Martsinkevich#Death\n\nIncluded are four medias, sometimes they are posted in an order other than that which I intended, so I will just describe them and you will know which is what. \n\nOne of Maxim \"Tesak\" Marsinkevich, one of a Russian jew explaining what the jewish community in Russia is like, another of Chabad jew explaining Putin is in full contact with Israel in syria, and a picture of Russian separatists in East Ukraine from 2014, which is 100% representative of the Russian separatists. They all go to war with soviet and antifa iconography.",

He is no doubt referring to Tesak and the militant community he created, which he did by staging fake murder videos and the like. When people make this claim, ask them why Tesak was never charged with a violent crime, whereas he was charged with hate speech related crimes several times? Read this post (https://t.me/JamesArants/14) of mine as well as this one (https://t.me/JamesArants/107) to learn more about Tesak. However, the claim that the only organizations banned in Russia are National Socialist is not true. Slavic Union was a Russian National Socialist organization which was banned. However, at the same time that Slavic Union (SS) was in operation, there was another loosely connected organizations named The Union Against Illegal Immigration (DPNI). All the real NS in Russia at the time were in or connected to SS, with some participating with DPNI. SS were explicitly NS, whereas DPNI was simply opposed to non-Whites causing trouble in the streets of St. Petersburg and Moscow. DPNI was formed in the wake of several attacks on White Russians by non-White immigrants to Russia. Both were banned. DPNI was not an explicitly National Socialist organization, DPNI did not make videos of themselves attacking non-Whites, the most that could be said was that DPNI \"members\" (it was more of a network than an organization with dues, membership lists, rules, hierarchy etc.) got into physical disputes with non-Whites. DPNI insisted its members follow the law. To claim that DPNI deserved to be banned is essentially to justify the American persecution of the Rise Above Movement. Both got into fights at political events, both got persecuted by the system. Will2Rise can exist in America quite openly, DPNI was banned and persecuted. Eric Striker can get on stage in America and say that evil jews run the American government with the intention of destroying the White race, and that White people must awake. If he tried that in Russia, he would be lucky to just get expelled or jailed, he could potentially wind up like Tesak if he got too famous.

Jackson.Tuesday, October 18, 2022, at 12 PM (ET)Dial 667-776-9181 (no code needed) Dear Patriot,On the 4th of July in Chicago in 2020, 7-year-old Natalia Wallace was playing on a sidewalk at her grandmother’s house when a car pulled up. Three men got out and started shooting up a holiday gathering.Natalia was killed, joining a growing list of children slain in cities by criminals. In Chicago that year, over the 4th of July weekend, 87 people were shot, 17 of them fatally, including Natalia and a 14-year-old boy who was killed when four masked gunmen opened fire at a gathering in Englewood.They were among nine children under the age of 18 shot dead in Chicago in 2020 between June 20 and July 8.Nathan Wallace, who is the father of Natalia and three other children, has asked why there haven’t been protests on behalf of victims like his daughter the way Black Lives Matter has staged events castigating police.Nathan will be one of several speakers at a special event in Chicago to be held by STAND in which we will implore public officials to do something about the rampant violence that is killing children.The Save the Children Conference will be held on Saturday, October 15, in Chicago at New Beginnings Church of Chicago, where its pastor, Corey Brooks, has taken a leadership role in highlighting the violence against inner city children and tackling urban blight. He founded Project H.O.O.D. which provides mentorship, training and community for residents of Woodlawn and Englewood.I will give the keynote, and other speakers include Pastor Brooks, Cecil Blye, Pastor of More Grace Ministries in Louisville, Kentucky and a STAND Vice President, along with Pastor Iverson Jackson, of Zoe Bible Church, in Little Rock, Arkansas, also a STAND Vice President, Dallas Police Sgt. Demetrick “Tre” Pennie, President of the National Fallen Officer Foundation, and Jennifer Wallace, who heads Black Families Matter and co-founded Freedom’s Journal Institute with husband Dr. Eric Wallace.Also speaking will be Angela Gregg, who lost her 4-year-old son MJ to a drive-by shooting in Chicago in September 2021. MJ was sitting in a chair getting a haircut when gunshots exploded from a passing car. He was shot in the head twice.My friends, I cannot express how wrenching it is to see young lives snuffed out and their families in mourning.The police are not the problem; they did not create a system that destroys families and leaves children vulnerable to a criminal-dominated environment.On Wednesday, October 12, a 12-year-old girl was killed while helping her mother unload groceries from her car in Milwaukee. On Oct. 4, a 9-year-old boy in Oklahoma City was killed in a drive-by shooting.Here is a list of the top 10 cities in child killing since January 2020:1. Chicago (56 murdered children)2. Philadelphia (21 murdered children)3. Memphis (16 murdered children)4. St. Louis (11 murdered children)5. Louisville (9 murdered children)6. New York City (7 murdered children)Tied at 7. Atlanta (6 murdered children)Tied at 7. Los Angeles (6 murdered children)Tied at 7. Dallas/Ft. Worth (6 murdered children)Tied at 7. Milwaukee (6 murdered children)Tied at 8. Washington DC (5 murdered children)Tied at 8. Detroit (5 murdered children)Tied at 8. Minneapolis (5 murdered children)Tied at 8. Richmond, VA (5 murdered children)Tied at 8. Houston (5 murdered children)Tied at 9. Baton Rouge (4 murdered childrenTied at 9. Kansas City (4 murdered children)Tied at 10. Indianapolis (3 murdered children)Tied at 10. Toledo (3 murdered childrenTied at 10. San Antonio (3 murdered childrenThis horrible trend has to be stopped. More people must express outrage at the sheer carnage of innocent children that the media overlook while demonizing police.There is no easy answer, but we do know that if we want to halt the violence and keep kids safe, we must have a revival of faith in God, help restore the two-parent, mom-and-dad married family, and help police restore order in lawless neighborhoods.Bishop E.W. Jackson is president of Staying True to America’s National Destiny (STAND) in Chesapeake, Va., head pastor at The Called Church, also in Chesapeake, and the host of this weekly national conference call.A Marine Corps veteran and graduate of the University of Massachusetts Boston and Harvard Law School, Bishop Jackson has authored several books and appeared as a commentator on national news networks such as C-SPAN, Fox News, and MSNBC.He hosts a daily program, The Awakening, on American Family Radio from 1 to 2 p.m. ET, and a daily podcast, and directs the Awakening Hearts and Minds Project, an outreach to black, Hispanic, and other minority voters.

In Chicago that year, over the 4th of July weekend, 87 people were shot, 17 of them fatally, including Natalia and a 14-year-old boy who was killed when four masked gunmen opened fire at a gathering in Englewood.<br /><br />They were among nine children under the age of 18 shot dead in Chicago in 2020 between June 20 and July 8.<br /><br />Nathan Wallace, who is the father of Natalia and three other children, has asked why there haven’t been protests on behalf of victims like his daughter the way Black Lives Matter has staged events castigating police.<br /><br />Nathan will be one of several speakers at a special event in Chicago to be held by STAND in which we will implore public officials to do something about the rampant violence that is killing children.<br /><br />The Save the Children Conference will be held on Saturday, October 15, in Chicago at New Beginnings Church of Chicago, where its pastor, Corey Brooks, has taken a leadership role in highlighting the violence against inner city children and tackling urban blight. He founded Project H.O.O.D. which provides mentorship, training and community for residents of Woodlawn and Englewood.<br /><br />I will give the keynote, and other speakers include Pastor Brooks, Cecil Blye, Pastor of More Grace Ministries in Louisville, Kentucky and a STAND Vice President, along with Pastor Iverson Jackson, of Zoe Bible Church, in Little Rock, Arkansas, also a STAND Vice President, Dallas Police Sgt. Demetrick “Tre” Pennie, President of the National Fallen Officer Foundation, and Jennifer Wallace, who heads Black Families Matter and co-founded Freedom’s Journal Institute with husband Dr. Eric Wallace.<br /><br />Also speaking will be Angela Gregg, who lost her 4-year-old son MJ to a drive-by shooting in Chicago in September 2021. MJ was sitting in a chair getting a haircut when gunshots exploded from a passing car. He was shot in the head twice.<br /><br />My friends, I cannot express how wrenching it is to see young lives snuffed out and their families in mourning.<br /><br />The police are not the problem; they did not create a system that destroys families and leaves children vulnerable to a criminal-dominated environment.<br /><br />On Wednesday, October 12, a 12-year-old girl was killed while helping her mother unload groceries from her car in Milwaukee. On Oct. 4, a 9-year-old boy in Oklahoma City was killed in a drive-by shooting.<br /><br />Here is a list of the top 10 cities in child killing since January 2020:<br /><br />1. Chicago (56 murdered children)<br /><br />2. Philadelphia (21 murdered children)<br /><br />3. Memphis (16 murdered children)<br /><br />4. St. Louis (11 murdered children)<br /><br />5. Louisville (9 murdered children)<br /><br />6. New York City (7 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 7. Atlanta (6 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 7. Los Angeles (6 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 7. Dallas/Ft. Worth (6 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 7. Milwaukee (6 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 8. Washington DC (5 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 8. Detroit (5 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 8. Minneapolis (5 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 8. Richmond, VA (5 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 8. Houston (5 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 9. Baton Rouge (4 murdered children<br /><br />Tied at 9. Kansas City (4 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 10. Indianapolis (3 murdered children)<br /><br />Tied at 10. Toledo (3 murdered children<br /><br />Tied at 10. San Antonio (3 murdered children<br /><br />This horrible trend has to be stopped. More people must express outrage at the sheer carnage of innocent children that the media overlook while demonizing police.<br />There is no easy answer, but we do know that if we want to halt the violence and keep kids safe, we must have a revival of faith in God, help restore the two-parent, mom-and-dad married family, and help police restore order in lawless neighborhoods.<br />Bishop E.W. Jackson is president of Staying True to America’s National Destiny (STAND) in Chesapeake, Va., head pastor at The Called Church, also in Chesapeake, and the host of this weekly national conference call.<br />A Marine Corps veteran and graduate of the University of Massachusetts Boston and Harvard Law School, Bishop Jackson has authored several books and appeared as a commentator on national news networks such as C-SPAN, Fox News, and MSNBC.<br />He hosts a daily program, The Awakening, on American Family Radio from 1 to 2 p.m. ET, and a daily podcast, and directs the Awakening Hearts and Minds Project, an outreach to black, Hispanic, and other minority voters.  <br /><br />For God and Country,<br />Bishop E.W. Jackson Sr.       Founder/President<br /><a href=\"https://stand.salsalabs.org/bishopewjackson-stoppingkillingofchildren\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>stand.salsalabs.org/bishopewjackson-stoppingk<span class=\"invisible\">illingofchildren<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
