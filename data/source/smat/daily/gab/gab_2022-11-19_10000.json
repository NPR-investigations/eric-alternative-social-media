Please help to create a database of vaccine injuries that can be used to educate the public, and warn people of potentially life-altering or deadly outcomes. (Posts focused on vaccine debate will be removed; this group was created to keep a record of the injuries and deaths caused by vaccines that the Democrat MSM refuses to report.) Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you’ll want to be sure you’re posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

          "content": "Digital identity: the CAQ called out for its lack of transparencyThe government is \"unable to deliver the goods\" while ensuring the protection of Quebecers' data in the realization of its digital identity project, say the oppositions, who are calling for a public consultation.\"In 2019, Minister [Eric] Caire announced a digital identity for 2021. Here we are soon in 2023 and we see that the Minister is unable to deliver. While he even seems to have trouble respecting the law on the protection of personal information, Quebecers are entitled to wonder if he knows where he is going,\" said Quebec Solidaire MP Haroun Bouazzi, who was elected in the riding of Maurice-Richard on October 3.  On Monday morning, our Parliamentary Office revealed that the flagship project of Minister Eric Caire, the digital identity, is in trouble. According to our information, the lack of transparency of Éric Caire's ministry is blocking his project for citizens, because he is unable to guarantee the Commission d'accès à l'information (CAI) that he will respect the protection of personal data.  For this reason, the CAI has refused to approve the ClicSÉQUR upgrade. This is the first milestone of the project and Éric Caire had promised that it would be put into service last June.   \"Considering that this project will swallow up hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of public money, it is time for the government to start a parliamentary commission so that we can finally hear from all relevant stakeholders on this important and sensitive issue,\" added Haroun Bouazzi, the new person responsible for digital security. GeneralizedThe PQ feel that these revelations are not reassuring. The parliamentary leader of the formation, Pascal Bérubé, says that the lack of transparency of the CAQ is generalized.  \"Since 2018 this government has problems with transparency and on access to information. All those who try to have information from this government realize that we give the least information possible,\" he said, wishing in that the project could be subject to consultation. \"If there is an issue that should be the subject of a public debate, it is that of access to data,\" he said.  He went so far as to call for the project to be abandoned if Eric Caire's department is unable to comply with CAI rules.  \"If this minister and this government are not capable of managing this file, they might as well abandon it (...) As long as there is no guarantee that we can do things properly.\" At the formation of the council of ministers, the responsibilities of access to information and protection of personal data were taken out of the hands of Eric Caire. Mr. Bérubé is not reassured to see this file land in Jean-François Roberge's court.   \"It does not change anything with this government. This government, in a general way, has a problem with access to information. Whether it is him or another, it seems to be generalized with the CAQ,\" he said. Doubts The Liberal MP for Marguerite-Bourgeois, Fred Beauchemin, doubts, for his part, the leadership abilities of Minister Eric Caire.  \"We have serious questions about Minister Caire's ability to deliver any project. Quebecers expect their data to be protected. In a world increasingly subject to cyberattacks and piracy, it is the government's duty to ensure the protection of all citizens,\" he said.  https://www.journaldequebec.com/2022/11/14/identite-numerique-eric-caire-est-incapable-de-livrer-la-marchandise-plaide-qs",

The parliamentary leader of the formation, Pascal Bérubé, says that the lack of transparency of the CAQ is generalized.  <br /><br />\"Since 2018 this government has problems with transparency and on access to information. All those who try to have information from this government realize that we give the least information possible,\" he said, wishing in that the project could be subject to consultation. \"If there is an issue that should be the subject of a public debate, it is that of access to data,\" he said.  <br /><br />He went so far as to call for the project to be abandoned if Eric Caire's department is unable to comply with CAI rules.  <br /><br />\"If this minister and this government are not capable of managing this file, they might as well abandon it (...) As long as there is no guarantee that we can do things properly.\" <br /><br />At the formation of the council of ministers, the responsibilities of access to information and protection of personal data were taken out of the hands of Eric Caire. Mr. Bérubé is not reassured to see this file land in Jean-François Roberge's court.   <br /><br />\"It does not change anything with this government. This government, in a general way, has a problem with access to information. Whether it is him or another, it seems to be generalized with the CAQ,\" he said. <br /><br />Doubts <br /><br />The Liberal MP for Marguerite-Bourgeois, Fred Beauchemin, doubts, for his part, the leadership abilities of Minister Eric Caire.  <br /><br />\"We have serious questions about Minister Caire's ability to deliver any project. Quebecers expect their data to be protected. In a world increasingly subject to cyberattacks and piracy, it is the government's duty to ensure the protection of all citizens,\" he said.  <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.journaldequebec.com/2022/11/14/identite-numerique-eric-caire-est-incapable-de-livrer-la-marchandise-plaide-qs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>journaldequebec.com/2022/11/14/identite-numer<span class=\"invisible\">ique-eric-caire-est-incapable-de-livrer-la-marchandise-plaide-qs<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",
