Et ce, quelle que soit la couleur de l’administration au pouvoir. Le plus stupéfiant, le plus contraire, surtout, à légende dorée de l’Amérique libératrice, c’est la compromission jamais démentie de Roosevelt avec le régime de Vichy et ses hommes, et ce jusqu’en 1944, pour tenter d’empêcher la France de recouvrer l’entièreté de sa souveraineté nationale.",

NYC Mayor Adams 'is considering 2024 White House bid if ailing Joe Biden, 79, declines to run and will position himself as 'anti-woke Democrat.'NYC Mayor Eric Adams is eyeing up a 2024 White House bid as an anti-woke Democrat if Joe Biden decides not to run for a second term, it is claimed.  Adams, 61, - who once referred to himself as the 'Biden of Brooklyn' - has 'repeatedly' told confidantes that he is considering running for the highest office and thinks he could 'win,' sources told the New York Post. 'Eric has told me repeatedly that he thinks that he has a platform to run for national office, for president in 2024,' a source close to the mayor told the Post. 'He thinks New York is a national platform [and] he thinks the national party has gotten too far to the left and he thinks he has a platform to win.' A Brooklyn Democratic official, who was not identified, told the Post Adam's advisor Ingrid Lewis-Martin was 'running point' on the matter and he'd only stake his claim on the presidency if Biden, 79, declined to run again. There have been conflicting reports about whether Biden will seek a second term. He is already the oldest president to ever hold office, and his year-and-a-half in office has been marred with what critics claim are cognitive slips.Ahead of the 2020 election, Biden himself had reportedly conceded he'd be a single-term president who hoped to reunite the US in the wake of Donald Trump's divisive presidency.But there is no obvious Democrat candidate to succeed him, with Vice President Kamala Harris's personal approval ratings stubbornly low, and Biden is now said to be touting a 2024 run. While only five months into his first term in office, Adams has pleased many centrist Democrats - and conservatives - by avoiding progressive or extreme stances on economic and social issues.  However, Adam's advisor Evan Thies dismissed rumors, saying: 'The mayor has not had any conversations with anyone about running for president. He is 100 percent focused on lowering crime and improving the economy in New York, and bringing this city back.'The mayor does seem to have some backing, though, as CEO of Tusk Strategies Chris Coffey told the New York Post: 'He is one of the best-known black elected officials in the country. The play works if Adams makes progress on crime and the president decides not to run. I think he would be crazy not to consider it.'",

The annual budget for the Chicago Police Department is more than $1.6 billion.JOEL B. POLLAK19 May 2022Democratic Party mayors in Los Angeles and San Francisco who backed the “Defund the Police” movement during the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020 are now scrambling to add more cops to the beat as their cities face major crime waves.In Los Angeles, where outgoing Mayor Eric Garcetti slashed over 10% of the police budget in June 2020, even as rioters rampaged through the streets, the city council revealed Wednesday it could not meet his new target for hiring more officers.The Los Angeles Times reported:The Los Angeles City Council scaled back Mayor Eric Garcetti’s spending plan for the Police Department on Wednesday, after receiving a report that said his target for police hiring cannot be achieved.Garcetti proposed a citywide budget last month that called for the recruitment of 780 officers — a number that, once departures are factored in, would increase LAPD staffing to 9,735 officers. Chief Legislative Analyst Sharon Tso, who advises the council, warned in a recent memo that the LAPD would not reach that number, since staffing at the department has continued to decline.Wednesday’s vote comes at a time when LAPD staffing is an issue in the June 7 election. Real estate developer Rick Caruso and businessman Mel Wilson have called for the LAPD to have 11,000 officers, while Rep. Karen Bass and Councilman Kevin de León have argued in favor of 9,700.In San Francisco, where Mayor London Breed once called for $120 million to be redistributed from law enforcement to the black community, before reversing her position last year, an upcoming budget battle will feature fights about funding cops.The San Francisco Chronicle reported:San Francisco Mayor London Breed said Wednesday she’ll push for police academy classes and investment to recruit and retain officers in the upcoming city budget amid public safety concerns from residents and businesses.Breed told business leaders Wednesday morning public safety “would be a top priority” in the budget she will propose to supervisors on June 1, according to a copy of the speech. She mentioned police are below recommended staffing levels.The mayor could get pushback from the board — dominated by progressives — if she wants more academy classes and police funding, but supervisors are more likely to support filling vacant positions. Breed needs supervisors’ support to pass the budget.[rest @ link]https://www.breitbart.com/law-and-order/2022/05/19/democrat-mayors-in-california-who-backed-defund-the-police-scramble-to-add-cops/",
