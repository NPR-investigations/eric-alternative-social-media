Since 1984, USACE has used the 1983 Principles and Guidelines for Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies in order to ensure that tax payer's money went to Civil Works studies that weren't overbuilt, weren't some congressman's personal pet project, but instead used modern engineering, environmental, and economic models and strategies in order to provide for National Economic Development and National Ecosystem Development. Civil Works studies required that any recommended plan provide the best bang for the money spent (flood damage / flood risk reductions, deep draft or shallow draft navigation).

The party’s founder, Howard Phillips, was on the ballot in 21 states as its first presidential candidate.1995: Party recognized by Federal Election Commission as a national party bringing the number of nationally recognized parties to 5.1999: Name changed to “Constitution Party” by delegates at the National Convention to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations. A BRIEF ELECTION HISTORY1992: A coalition of independent state parties united to form the U.S. Taxpayers Party at its first national convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Among the notable convention speakers was former Congressman Ron Paul. The party’s founder, Howard Phillips of Virginia, Chairman of the grass-roots lobby, the Conservative Caucus, was nominated to be the party’s first candidate for President with retired Army Brigadier General Albion Knight of Maryland nominated as the party’s first vice-presidential running mate. The US Taxpayer’s Party secured ballot position in 21 states.1996: Howard Phillips was again nominated to be the party’s presidential candidate for the 1996 campaign at the party’s national convention held in San Diego, California.  Attorney and writer Herb Titus of Oregon was the Constitution Party’s Vice President nominee. Ballot access was achieved in 39 states for the 1996 elections, representing over 80% of the Electoral College votes available.2000: Delegates attending the National Convention in September 1999 voted to change the name of the US Taxpayer’s Party to “Constitution Party” to better reflect the party’s primary focus of returning government to the U.S. Constitution’s provisions and limitations.  For a third and last time, Howard Phillips was nominated to serve as the standard bearer for the newly named Constitution Party for the 2000 election. Missouri surgeon Dr. J. Curtis Frazier was the nominee for Vice President. The convention was held in St. Louis, Missouri.2004: The Constitution Party achieved ballot access in 41 states and, at its convention in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, it nominated Maryland lawyer Michael Peroutka, founder of the Institute on the Constitution, as its presidential nominee with Florida minister and commentator Chuck Baldwin as its nominee for Vice-President. Although the Constitution Party was on fewer state ballots in 2004, the vote tally increased by 40 percent compared to the 2000 elections while other ‘alternative’ parties lost ground or barely matched their 2000 vote totals.2008: At its Kansas City, Missouri national convention, the Constitution Party nominated its 2004 nominee for Vice President, Chuck Baldwin of Florida, to be its 2008 nominee for President, selecting attorney and Constitution Party activist Darrell Castle of Tennessee, to serve as the Vice-presidential nominee.2012: Former six-term Virginia Congressman, Virgil Goode, was nominated for President at the Constitution Party National Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Three-term Constitution Party National Chairman, attorney Jim Clymer of Pennsylvania, was nominated to serve as Goode’s running mate.2016: Founding Constitution Party member, three term Vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Constitution Party, and 2008 Constitution Party Vice-presidential Candidate Darrell Castle was nominated for President. Mr. Castle’s running mate was Dr. Scott Bradley of Utah who holds a PhD in Constitutional Law. The campaign garnered over 200,000 votes setting a Constitution Party record.",

If the SSCI rejects the candidate, they simply refuse to take up the nomination. The president is then blocked from that appointment. This is what happened with President Trump over-and-over again.\" (...)<br /><br />\"Donald J. <a href=\"/tags/Trump\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Trump<\/a>, an outsider who was a risk to every entity in the institutional construct of Washington DC. Trillions were at stake, and years of affluence and influence were at risk as the unholy alliance was put together.\"<br /><br />\"To understand the risk that <a href=\"/tags/JulianAssange\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#JulianAssange<\/a> represented to U.S. Intelligence Branch interests, it is important to understand just how extensive the operations of the [FBi/CiA] were in 2016. Its within the network of foreign &amp; domestic intel operations where Intelligence Branch political tool, \"FBI Agent\" Peter Strzok, was working as a bridge between the CIA &amp; FBI counterintelligence operations.\" (...)<br /><br />\"The creation of the Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 intelligence network was specifically because the Obama administration started supporting radical Islamists within the Muslim Brotherhood &amp; threw fuel on the fires of extremism all over the Arab world. Think about it, what would you do if you were 🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia, 🇪🇬 Egypt, 🇧🇭 Bahrain, 🇰🇼 Kuwait, the 🇦🇪 UAE, 🇯🇴 Jordan, Oman or 🇾🇪 Yemen &amp; you knew the United States 🇺🇸 could just trigger an internal uprising of [their] al-Qaeda, ISIS &amp; the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood to seek your destruction? Without a doubt, those urgent lessons from 2009, 2010, 2011 triggered the formation of the Arab Intelligence Network as a network to defend itself with consistency. They assembled the network &amp; activated it in 2017 as pictured above.\" (...)<br /> <br />\"The Obama network took pre-assembled intelligence weapons we should never have allowed to be created &amp; turned those weapons into tools for his radical &amp; fundamental change. The target was the essential fabric of our nation. Ultimately, this corrupt political process gave power to create the Fourth Branch of Government, the Intelligence Branch. From that perspective the fundamental change was successful.<br /> <br />Every person in [their] DC system, regardless of where they are located in their containment silos, knew what had taken place. [They] all knew. No one in DC did not know. This is the very reason why both parties desperately needed to get Andrew Weissmann &amp; Robert Mueller installed. The 2017 special counsel, under guise of a Trump-Russia investigation, was [their] COVER UP plan. Intent of [their] special counsel was to protect all the inside &amp; outside 'agents' across all branches who has been working together against Trump throughout his candidacy &amp; into Trumps presidency.\" (...)<br /> <br /><a href=\"https://theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2022/02/12/the-surveillance-and-political-spying-operations-highlighted-by-john-durham-are-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>theconservativetreehouse.com/blog/2022/02/12/<span class=\"invisible\">the-surveillance-and-political-spying-operations-highlighted-by-john-durham-are-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br /><a href=\"/tags/Durham\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Durham<\/a> +",
