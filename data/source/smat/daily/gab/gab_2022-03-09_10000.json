            "description": "by WorldTribune Staff, March 1, 2022\r\n\r\nPolice body cam video out of Salida, Colorado shows former Dominion Voting Systems executive Eric Coomer continually denying to police that he was responsible for crashing his truck into a building before finally admitting he indeed was behind the wheel.\r\n\r\n[caption id=attachment_106843 align=alignleft width=425] Eric Coomer[/caption]\r\n\r\nDespite being told that several witnesses had described him to a T and police saying damage to his truck matched damage to the building, Coomer continues to deny responsibility before telling the police to speak to his lawyer.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in September of last year but the body cam footage did not emerge on YouTube until Monday.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the body cam video, after police had spoken to the lawyer and explained that Coomer could be charged with a felony, Coomer finally comes clean and admits crashing into the building, saying he was under a lot of stress and then telling the police they could Google my name.\r\n\r\nPolice also tell the lawyer that Coomer managed to avoid a DUI by going to a local bar and having a few shots of alcohol immediately after the crash.\r\n\r\nJoe Oltmann, the Denver businessman who received death threats after exposing Coomer for boasting about being able to rig the 2020 election against President Donald Trump, wrote in a Telegram post:\r\n\r\nYeah… guy hits a building, lies about that he did it, three times… says he panicked. But he had nothing to do with the stealing of an election, ties to Antifa and deleting all his social accounts and posts before filing a lawsuit? Nah… all that is just a coincidence. My life has been turned upside down while this piece of excrement continues to wreak havoc on others. Even after we have the proof that the machines are stealing elections and proof mounts… they continue to lie, more… the counter suits and suits are going to be very fun.\r\n\r\nRelated: Who is Eric Coomer of Dominion Voting Systems?, November 17, 2020\r\n\r\nCoomer was vice president of U.S. engineering for Dominion Voting Systems. According to his biography, Coomer graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics. He was later promoted to voting systems officer of strategy and security at Dominion.\r\n\r\nOltmann exposed Coomer as having told Antifa members: “Don’t worry about the election, Trump’s not gonna win. I made f*cking sure of that!”\r\n\r\nOltmann said he was banned from Twitter after exposing Coomer.\r\n\r\nTrump White House adviser Garrett Ziegler, whose Marco Polo research group is investigating the 2020 election and Hunter Biden. said of Coomer in a Telegram post: Full take.. this guy is a MESS! And, more importantly, he is a Bolshevik!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Why WorldTribune? . . . . Executive Intelligence Brief",

I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings. Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified. Vs 22-27Several years ago I was directing at a Bible camp and we chose running the race as our summer theme based on this passage. We tied in all kinds of activities with races of different sorts. Our Bible lessons all incorperated this theme. And we highlighted different people who raced and their testimonies. One of my favorites was Eric Liddlle. If you have ever seen Chariots of fire you know who I am talking about. What really stood out to me was more than his stance against running on the Sabbath or setting a record and winning the gold in the 440. What stood out to me was his attitude and the life he lived beyond the track. This quote is my favorite.I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast!And when I run I feel his pleasure.~Eric LiddellNotice he differentiates between God's purpose and his ability and joy to run. Eric ran his life race striving after God's prize. He lived pursuing God's purpose for him, sharing the gospel, serving as a missionary,  and even in the end sacrificing his own life so a pregnant woman could be saved. Here are a few more quotes from Eric.We are all missionaries. Wherever we go we either bring people nearer to Christ or we repel them from Christ.~Eric LiddellYou will know as much of God, and only as much of God, as you are willing to put into practice.~Eric LiddellMany of us are missing something in life because we are after the second best.~Eric LiddellIt has been a wonderful experience to compete in the Olympic Games and to bring home a gold medal. But since I have been a young lad, I have had my eyes on a different prize. You see, each one of us is in a greater race than any I have run in Paris, and this race ends when God gives out the medals.~Eric LiddellDo you ever feel like you just don't have what it takes to finish the race? Remember Psalm 46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Think about God the Father helping us through the race while watching these 3 clips.https://youtu.be/PhdoTThn5mwhttps://youtu.be/dDnrLv6z-mMhttps://youtu.be/rPLCaAu_H2U",

At a Friday press conference in Times Square, the mayor made a direct call to travelers to return to the city – which he then declared was “so boring.”“It is time for us to enjoy our city again. All of these ‘nos, nos, nos.’ We’ve become a city of ‘nos.’ I want to become a city of excitement,” Adams said while announcing the citywide COVID-19 vaccine mandate for most indoor spaces would officially be lifted on Monday.So does that mean Adams didn’t ‘enjoy’ his numerous high-profile dinners and exclusive night club outings in recent months? He’s been spotted frequenting the celeb-heavy Zero Bond on several occasions, out at Osteria La Baia in Midtown (with some questionable guests), celebrating his election victory at Casa Cipriani, and he recently sat courtside at a Knicks game.And while the announcement was cast as a citywide reopening, most businesses have been open for over a year, with some operating at capacity in recent months. It’s clear even to the casual observer that the bar and restaurant scene is back in full swing. The Broadway League reported a 92% capacity average at shows last week.Attendance at Knicks NBA games was down just 3% from pre-pandemic levels in December, according to Sports Business Journal, and attendance at Nets games was higher than in 2019. “The Knicks and Rangers, concerts at the Beacon, have all been attended very well with confidence,” Tony Malkin, CEO of Empire State Realty Trust, told Bloomberg last month. “All these things provide some level of normalcy to help bring people back.”The mayor’s declaration that the city has lost its spark was made in response to a reporter who asked if the Puerto Rican Day Parade, which was virtual last year, would be held in person in 2022.“We’re going to reinstate every parade, every festival, every block party,” Adams said. It was also a plea to tourists: “That’s why we’re right here in Times Square to tell people from Canada, Arkansas, from New Zealand, from anywhere else, come here but don’t come here to just walk, spend some money in restaurants,” he said.The suspended vaccine mandate comes after Adams said on Sunday he would make a final decision about the fate of the “Key to NYC” program by the end of the week.",

This can actually happen for a variety of reasons. Sometimes your child, who is the parent, is afflicted with a serious sickness that renders him or her incapable of caring for themselves and their children.When a catastrophic sickness strikes, social services will frequently step in to protect your grandkids. They may wish to place them in foster care, but if you want to care for your grandchildren yourself, this is usually the best option. If and when your child recovers from a serious illness, he or she will be able to return to caring for the children. Your assistance will be remembered by your child for the rest of his or her life.Sadly, drug and alcohol misuse may devastate a family. When a parent is out of control due to drugs or alcohol, temporary child custody for grandparents may be granted. If a parent is prepared to go through lengthy drug or alcohol rehabilitation, which can take anywhere from six months to 1year, they can typically regain custody of their children.Another reason grandparents get custody of their grandkids is when their children's parents are unable to provide for their children financially. It may be heartbreaking for a loving parent to be unable to provide food and shelter for their children. As a grandmother, you can step in and assist your child until he or she can get back on his/her feet financially.If you require the aid of a qualified &amp; trustworthy family lawyer who understands the stress, worry, and what it takes to argue for your rights and benefits in family law problems, please call the office of Eric child custody as soon as possible.

America is being quietly invaded day by day but all the focus is on Ukraine since Putin is invading loudly.  And the Democrats have committed several crimes but does anything happen to them? Nope. Look at Eric Swalwell sleeping with his communist Chinese spy handler, and he gave her Chinese spy friend a job. And Nancy Pelosi knew. Anything happen to Swalwel? Nope. Nothing. Only people who actually push and work to try and make Americ better and strongper get attacked like Trump and Gosar and Green and Boebert and Gohmert and Gaetz and Jordan and Nunes and others.

It’s called “constitutional” as it reflects the Second Amendment guarantee that exercising such a right may not be “infringed” by government.The bill’s author, Representative Ben Smaltz, said his bill “levels the playing field” by allowing the state’s citizens to carry openly or concealed, adding:House Bill 1077 gets us to a place where the law-abiding citizen is not required to go through a process of asking permission, submitting to government investigation, supplying their fingerprints to enjoy a right that is constitutional at the federal level and constitutional at the state level.On March 5, the Georgia Senate passed a similar bill, removing the need for Georgians to obtain a permit before being able to carry a firearm in public.Alabama’s Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill last week that would grant the state’s citizens the freedom to carry a firearm without first obtaining permission. It now heads to the full Senate for approval and then on to Governor Kay Ivey’s desk for her signature.On March 3, Ohio’s General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill eliminating the need for Ohioans to get a concealed-carry permit — the House by 57-35, and the Senate by 24-8.

Years and years ago, James Baker, former Chief of Staff, Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State, admitted every U.S. national interest in foreign policy relative to the Middle East in the second half of the 21st Century and now 22nd Century involves ENERGY. Someone finally admitted it. I’m fine with it.          The U.S. needs energy. The fact we obtained energy independence under Trump was a remarkable economic and national security achievement. As soon as he took office, Joe Biden reversed the entire Trump energy policies. This is a fact.          For an administration to choose energy dependence on the Middle East, Russia and possibly Venezuela is a national disgrace.          Obama even announced his plans to bankrupt coal. Hillary the same. From Trump’s policies on drilling, production and pipelines, to Biden’s immediate cutting off access to Anwar, leases, drilling, Keystone, regulations and on and on is crippling to our economy and our national security.          The recent hyperinflation on gasoline and fuel caused by all of Biden’s energy policy malpractice, his spending and his regulations proves his folly. In a classic career political hack gangster move, Biden blames the Ukraine invasion. No one is buying it.          Who is suffering most? The working man and woman and businesses. The constituency the Democrats always claim to care about “the working man and woman” are now living paycheck to paycheck like never before.           Biden leveled a political Munchausen on America, except he has no cure.          It makes me so angry at everyone responsible for giving this country Joe Biden and his disgraceful evil policies on energy and every other issue he obliterates with his intentional chaos and destruction. What is past is prologue, and everyone should have seen this coming.           I left out of my Mar A Lago trip video unintentionally a comment Trump made at dinner. Trump said he did not realize how important who the President was until after he was no longer President and Joe Biden began his destructive policies.          Focusing just on energy in this article, Biden’s policies are indefensible and we are all paying a heavy price both in national security and economics.",
