And here we stand - fleeing to Christ as our only hope for salvation.\"I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.\" (Psalm 73)Here we stand, on the \"Five Solas\" of the great reformation in Christian theology - the \"Reformation.\"1. Sola Scriptura - The authoritative rule for religious knowledge, faith and practice is the Bible alone (and not the traditions of any church or other religious organization).2. Sola Gratia - We - all we descendents of Adam - are sinners by nature. In ourselves, we are dead and dying - and utterly helpless and hopeless to save ourselves. We are completely dependent on God's grace alone to save us.3. Sola Fide - By His great mercy, God is pleased to save those who have faith in the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ. The instrument of our salvation is faith alone (and not our efforts or work).4. Solus Christus - It is the work of Christ alone - His perfect life of completely fulfilling the Law of God, His atoning sacrifice of death on the Cross to pay for our sins, and His resurrection from the dead to conquer death - that is the only merit and basis for our salvation.5. Soli Deo Gloria - Our salvation is completely by and from God, and God alone receives the glory for our salvation.\"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it - the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction. for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.\" (Romans 3:19-26)The purpose of this group is to promote & elucidate reformed Christian theology, and in so doing, glorify God, encourage his people, and urge sinners to flee to Christ, our only eternal hope and comfort.",

In Germany, allied forces extensively bombed and destroyed German cities in the latter part of the war targeting civilians rather than military installations.The US nuclear weapons arsenal has grown considerably. In the post Cold era, http://ArmsControl.org (April 2013) confirms that the United States‚Äúpossesses 5,113 nuclear warheads, including tactical, strategic, and non-deployed weapons.‚ÄùAccording to the latest official New START declaration, out of more than 5113 nuclear weapons,‚Äúthe US deploys 1,654 strategic nuclear warheads on 792 deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and strategic bombers‚Ä¶Moreover, according to The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) the U.S. possesses 500 tactical nuclear warheads, many of which are deployed in non-nuclear states including Germany, Italy, Turkey, Belgium, the Netherlands.The History of War CrimesThe notion of mass casualty producing events prevails to this date in US military strategies. Invariably, as in the case of Syria, the civilian casualties of war committed by the aggressor are blamed on the victims. The period extending from the Korean war to the present is marked by a succession of US sponsored theatre wars (Korea Vietnam, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yugoslavia), various forms of military intervention including low intensity conflicts, ‚Äúcivil wars‚Äù (The Congo, Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Sudan), military coups, US sponsored death squadrons and massacres (Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines), covert wars led by US intelligence, US-NATO sponsored military intervention in Libya (using Al Qaeda rebels as their foot soldiers sponsored by Western intelligence).The war on Syria is essentially a covert war of aggression whereby the Western military alliance and its GCC partners are  supporting a terrorist insurgency. The objective is to destabilize Syria as a nation state. The objective has not been to win these wars but in essence to destabilize these countries as nation states as well as impose a proxy government which acts on behalf of Western interests. Accounting for these various operations, the United States has attacked, directly or indirectly, some 44 countries in different regions of the developing world, since August 1945, a number of them many times (Eric Waddell, 2003): ‚ÄúThe avowed objective of these military interventions has been to effect ‚Äòregime change‚Äô. The cloaks of ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù and of ‚Äúdemocracy were invariably evoked to justify what were unilateral and illegal acts.‚Äù (Eric Waddell, 2003) - https://www.globalresearch.ca/imperial-conquest-americas-long-war-against-humanity/5364215",

Accounting for these various operations, the United States has attacked, directly or indirectly, some 44 countries in different regions of the developing world, since August 1945, a number of them many times (Eric Waddell, 2003): <br />‚ÄúThe avowed objective of these military interventions has been to effect ‚Äòregime change‚Äô. The cloaks of ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù and of ‚Äúdemocracy were invariably evoked to justify what were unilateral and illegal acts.‚Äù (Eric Waddell, 2003) - <a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/imperial-conquest-americas-long-war-against-humanity/5364215\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>globalresearch.ca/imperial-conquest-americas-<span class=\"invisible\">long-war-against-humanity/5364215<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Here in this group we want to encourage everyone to talk about all of the wonderful things Ron DeSantis has done since being elected Governor.\n\nThings like:\nOutlawing Sanctuary Cities in Florida.\nExpand Florida's E-Verify requirements.\nKeeping Florida open despite the pressure to close it again!\nPrevent local governments from fining people who don't wear masks.\nMaking sure everyone has the option of in person learning.\n\nThe list goes on and on! It is without a doubt that he needs a second term as Governor of Florida and strong consideration for President. I hope everyone enjoys!

Please limit to 5 posts per day.  No advertising of any kind, this includes promotion of blogs, websites, podcasts, and such - posts will be removed and your account will also be removed. No link only posts - include a summary so members know what the link will be about. Otherwise posts will be removed. Please double check that you are posting vaccine-related injury and death information in this group. There have been a lot of posts that are not related, and you‚Äôll want to be sure you‚Äôre posting in the right group. Off-topic posts will be removed. Members who repeatedly violate this rule may also be removed from the group without warning. Posts that include cursing/foul language or threats will be removed.

Their goal is an international rules based or-der where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

Jasper told Alex Newman for this special episode of Behind The Deep State. Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nation-alists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to ‚Äúkidnap‚Äù Michigan Gov. Whitmer. Jasper sug-gests that understanding these facts is foundational to understanding how the Deep State works and what may be coming.https://thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-getting-bolder/Bilderberg member POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE - I was the CIA director.

Their goal is an international rules based or-der where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State.

Jasper told Alex Newman for this special episode of Behind The Deep State. Jasper did perhaps the most in-depth investigation into what happened in Oklahoma City, and found some extremely troubling pieces of evidence that the Clinton administration was trying to sweep under the rug. More re-cently, he expressed suspicions about the supposed conspiracy to riot by white nation-alists in Northern Idaho. In between, the FBI has been regularly involved in key events, such as the now-debunked FBI-led plot to ‚Äúkidnap‚Äù Michigan Gov. Whitmer. Jasper sug-gests that understanding these facts is foundational to understanding how the Deep State works and what may be coming.<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-getting-bolder/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>thenewamerican.com/deep-states-false-flags-ge<span class=\"invisible\">tting-bolder/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Bilderberg member POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE - I was the CIA director.

Their goal is an international rules based or-der where the 1% ruling elite billionaires make the rules the 99% livestock have to live by even if those rules deny them freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is being done because the US Constitution affords the 99% livestock that the rules that govern them are the Rules of God and natural law. It is not a constitution that should be killed it is a constitution that should be adopted by every nation on earth if they truly desire freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of Church and State. <br /><br />The GOP needs to put a man in the Oval office who unlike 1% ruling √©lite globalists bil-lionaires like Trump and Biden is not afraid to out the CFR deep state by name and deed!<br />Ron Paul talks about American power structure, FED, Trilateral Commission and CFR 1988 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDZsQQ5wRBQ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>youtube.com/watch?v=xDZsQQ5wRBQ<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> <br /><br />CFR deep state FBI chief Chris Wray warns violent ‚Äòdomestic terrorism‚Äô growing in US<br />By ERIC TUCKER and MARY CLARE JALONICK<br />March 2, 2021<br />‚ÄúJan. 6 was not an isolated event.

          "content": "Wish I had something uplifting and positive to say on this dark morning, but just can't find the words.In my world view, our constitutional republic officially ceased to exist as of January 6, 2021, we are no more. Prepare yourselves for what's coming next because there will be no place to hide. The power of the vote has effectively and efficiently been neutralized, if in fact it ever existed at all. People just can't get their heads around that; they still believe that somehow their vote still matters and will matter even more in 2024.As a few brave political observers have pointed out: if we failed to correct the problems and injustices of the stolen 2020 election, why should we expect great results from this one?  Those few states that took some legislative actions in this area did well, Florida being the most notable.

Prepare yourselves for what's coming next because there will be no place to hide. The power of the vote has effectively and efficiently been neutralized, if in fact it ever existed at all. People just can't get their heads around that; they still believe that somehow their vote still matters and will matter even more in 2024.<br /><br />As a few brave political observers have pointed out: if we failed to correct the problems and injustices of the stolen 2020 election, why should we expect great results from this one?  Those few states that took some legislative actions in this area did well, Florida being the most notable.
