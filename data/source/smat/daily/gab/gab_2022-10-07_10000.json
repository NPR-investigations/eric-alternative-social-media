            "description": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) on Friday declared a state of emergency over the influx of illegal aliens. According to reports, five or six busloads of illegals are arriving from Texas to New York City each day. Adams lashed out at Abbott and accused the Texas governor of exploiting New York City’s compassion. “Although our compassion is limitless, our resources are not,” Adams said. “This is unsustainable.” Adams said the influx of illegals is “straining” the City’s ability to take care of New Yorkers in need. More than 17,000 illegals have been bussed into New York City in the last few months, according to ABC 7 NY. ABC 7 NY reported: The number of people in New York City shelters is setting new records daily amid the unyielding arrival of asylum seekers bussed from Texas and elsewhere. On Friday, New York Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency and announced an executive order to suspend land use requirements to help the city cope with the influx of people. Adams said he was “angry” the city’s compassion was being “exploited by others for political gain” and what he called a “humanitarian crisis” the mayor said is being “accelerated by American politics dynamics.” There are 61,000 people currently in the shelter system, “straining our ability to care for New Yorkers in need,” Adams said. He expects the city will have spent $1 billion by the end of the fiscal year 5,500 migrant children have been enrolled in city schools. Of the 61,000 people in shelters, 20,000 are children. One on five is an asylum seeker. More than 17,000 asylum seekers have been bussed to NYC.

We don&#39;t want to be political. We&#39;ll just keep our nose down, preach our little stuff on Sunday morning, and when we leave this building, we&#39;re going to bow to the authority of the state.&quot;Metaxas contends the American church today mirrors the silence of the German church before the Holocaust.If church leaders, he said, don&#39;t learn the lesson of the 1930s, &quot;we are going down precisely the same path.&quot;&quot;And people say, &#39;I can&#39;t believe it, I can&#39;t believe it.&#39; Trust me when I say that the Germans didn&#39;t believe that that future was even possible. But it happened, and we are no different than the Germans,&quot; he said.Metaxas is the author of a bestselling book about German Lutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who boldly opposed the Nazi regime and was executed for participating in the famous &quot;Operation Valkyrie&quot; plot to assassinate Hitler.&quot;Letter to the American Church,&quot; Metaxas explained to Robison, arose from his realization that &quot;the silence of the church in Germany that led to the satanic evil of the Nazis and the Holocaust is exactly the same as the silence of the church in America today.&quot;Without question, he said, that silence will lead the nation “to horror unimaginable, unless we repent, unless we cease being silent.”&quot;I cannot think of a more urgent message,&quot; he said. &quot;I beg people, I beg people to take what I am saying in this book seriously, because, of course, it’s not me talking.&quot;He said he humbly posits that God is trying tell the American church exactly what he told the German church through Bonhoeffer.https://youtu.be/l1g-DOb3jcchttps://www.wnd.com/2022/10/eric-metaxas-silence-american-church-echoes-1930s-nazi-germany/",

He spoke as the population of the city’s main shelter system, which stood at 61,379 on Thursday, 6 October, was set to break the record of 61,415 set in 2019. At least nine more migrant buses arrived on Friday, 7 October 2022.   Mr. Adams said that the migrants were on pace to send the shelter population soaring above 100k and that the influx could cost the city $1 billion in the current fiscal year alone. -snip-  Plenty of people are entering the shelter system from places other than Latin America, too. On Wednesday, 5 October, Leida Rivera, who had been flooded out of her apartment in Tampa, Fla., by Hurricane Ian, checked into the women’s intake shelter in the Bronx. She was assigned a bed in a 15-person room.  -snip-  Mr. Adams said the city was moving ahead with plans to build a tent intake center on Randalls Island, just off Manhattan, where new arrivals could stay for a few days. City officials are also negotiating with cruise line companies to house up to 2,700 migrants on a ship.Frank Carone, the mayor’s chief of staff, said in a brief interview at City Hall that the companies were Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line and Tallink, which is housing Ukrainian refugees in Estonia, though Mr. Carone said Norwegian’s cost estimate was too high.   -snip-  Mr. Adams has criticized Texas Governor Abbott for failing to coordinate migrant arrivals with his administration and called on him and other leaders to stop sending buses to New York and to spread the burden to other cities. He also asked the city of El Paso, led by a Democratic mayor, not to send migrants, following reports that the city had sent thousands of people to New York since August.“New Yorkers are angry,” Mr. Adams said. “I am angry too. We have not asked for this.”  [*** Psst!  Mayor Adams!  Texas and Florida didn't ask for it, either. ***]  -snip-  Outside a former women’s shelter in East New York, Brooklyn, that has been repurposed as an intake center for migrant men, Cesar Rodriguez, 37, a refrigeration technician from the Venezuelan city of Maracaibo, said Thursday that he and several new friends had made the rounds of possible employers within a few blocks: metalworks, an air-conditioning contractor and a construction site.At every spot, he said, they were told that they needed a certificate from the federal government’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration.“It costs money,” he said, “but how can we make money if we can’t work?” asked Mr. Rodriguez, who said he had left his wife and five children back home.

Texas and Florida didn't ask for it, either. ***]  <br /><br />-snip-  <br /><br />Outside a former women’s shelter in East New York, Brooklyn, that has been repurposed as an intake center for migrant men, Cesar Rodriguez, 37, a refrigeration technician from the Venezuelan city of Maracaibo, said Thursday that he and several new friends had made the rounds of possible employers within a few blocks: metalworks, an air-conditioning contractor and a construction site.<br /><br />At every spot, he said, they were told that they needed a certificate from the federal government’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<br /><br />“It costs money,” he said, “but how can we make money if we can’t work?” asked Mr. Rodriguez, who said he had left his wife and five children back home. <br /><br />[cont.]  <br /><br />Reporters: Andy Newman, Emma G Fitzsimmons, Kaya Laterman, Sean Piccoli and Karen Zraick.  <br /><br /><a href=\"/tags/alien\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#alien<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/invasion\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#invasion<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/refugee\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#refugee<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/asylum\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#asylum<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/migrant\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#migrant<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/migration\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#migration<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/immigrant\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#immigrant<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/immigration\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#immigration<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/sanctuary\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#sanctuary<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/NYC\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#NYC<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/NewYork\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#NewYork<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/USA\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#USA<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/homeless\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#homeless<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/homelessness\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#homelessness<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Texas\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Texas<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Mexico\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Mexico<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/border\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#border<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Abbott\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Abbott<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/DeSantis\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#DeSantis<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Florida\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Florida<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Venezuela\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Venezuela<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Bronx\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Bronx<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/ElPaso\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#ElPaso<\/a>  <a href=\"/tags/Biden\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Biden<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Hochul\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Hochul<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/employment\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#employment<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/OSHA\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#OSHA<\/a>  <a href=\"/tags/NYT\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#NYT<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/GreatReplacement\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#GreatReplacement<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/GrandRemplacement\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#GrandRemplacement<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/housing\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#housing<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Leeser\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Leeser<\/a>",

The office is now seeking Yu’s extradition to Los Angeles.PollChief, Konnech’s election worker management system product, was designed to assist with poll worker assignments, communications, and payroll, according to the statement.After learning about the arrest on Tuesday, the Fairfax County Office of Elections has stopped using Konnech’s PollChief election officer management software, said director and general registrar of the county’s electoral board, Eric Spicer, in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times on Oct. 6.The county is also ending its contract with Konnech, Spicer added.

The mayor said he would visit the tent city his administration is building on Randall’s Island to provide temporary housing for the arrivals.",

Well, it appears that the signs in Time Square might be working!

Buying drugs is illegal, and being from out of town, how would he have even known where to buy pills? And the proposition for sex was probably a trap. Any time that has happened to me, it has been. Kidding! Times Square sounds like a fun place to hang out without a gun!Then there was this story too:  Earlier last month, a 30-year-old tourist from Belgium was slashed in the face in an unprovoked attack at a Chelsea subway station in Manhattan, police said.And Sept. 1, a 21-year-old Big Apple visitor from St. Louis was attacked and raped at a Times Square subway station around 3 a.m., police said.It sounds like New York City should be a mandatory gun zone. Who wants to walk around a city where at any given moment, you could be slashed, beaten, raped, mugged, or run into one of the women from The View? Terrifying.Sadly, people can’t visit these large tourist cities without fear of personal injury. Tourists come from all over the world to experience the Big Apple; all they get is the worm. Eric Adams is a former police officer, yet he is so weak on crime it’s shocking. Amazing that flashing signs declaring gun-free zones haven’t worked. Maybe Adams can write a strongly worded letter to would-be crooks. Maybe that will help. Until then, I’ll take my tourist dollars somewhere I won’t get slashed for them.",
