          "content": "There’s Something Truly Sinister About The NYC Subway Shooter!-Independent minuteAccording to the Daily Mail report:His motive for the attack remains unclear; in YouTube videos posted online for weeks before the attack, he ranted about New York Mayor Eric Adams, crime and race in America. James has a criminal history in New York and New Jersey that includes prior arrests for sex assault, trespassing and possessing burglary tools.He had been living alone in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before the attack but on March 20, he packed up and skipped town in a rented van. He filmed YouTube videos along the way, keeping viewers updated with his progress.On March 28, he rented a 2-bedroom apartment in Philadelphia through a website called Evolve. The apartment is owned by 74-year-old Janet McDaniel. “I’m Frank, I’m the person you’re looking for. I’m surprised it took so long,” James told police as they arrested him, police sources said.Mohammed Chikh, who alerted police and witnessed the arrest, said James appeared calm and unfazed.  “He didn’t fight, he didn’t do anything, he totally surrendered,” said Chikh.The New York Post also added:  Federal prosecutors wasted no time charging James, 62, with terror-related offenses for firing 33 rounds on a Manhattan-bound N train Tuesday morning, leaving 10 people with gunshot wounds and another 19 injured in a mass shooting that shocked an already rattled city that’s been reeling from a citywide crime surge. They hit him with a charge of committing terrorist attacks and other violence against mass transportation systems, which could send him to prison for life if he’s convicted.Police arrested James just before 2 p.m. at First Avenue and St. Mark’s Place and about 2 hours later, he was walked from the 9th Precinct, grinning as cops shoved him into a waiting police car. During an afternoon press conference, Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement:  “My fellow New Yorkers: We got him, we got him. I cannot thank the men and women of the New York City Police Dept enough, as well as our federal agents, our state police, our first responders — from the 911 operators, to the various men and women from our medical professionals. We got him,” “I said to New Yorkers, ‘We’re going to protect the people of this city and apprehend those who believe they can bring terror to everyday New Yorkers,’ and I want to thank everyday New Yorkers who called in tips, who responded, who helped those passengers who were injured. Thirty-three shots, but less than 30 hours later, we’re able to say we got him.”",
          "contentraw": "There’s Something Truly Sinister About The NYC Subway Shooter!-Independent minute<br /><br />According to the Daily Mail report:<br />His motive for the attack remains unclear; in YouTube videos posted online for weeks before the attack, he ranted about New York Mayor Eric Adams, crime and race in America. <br />James has a criminal history in New York and New Jersey that includes prior arrests for sex assault, trespassing and possessing burglary tools.<br />He had been living alone in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before the attack but on March 20, he packed up and skipped town in a rented van. He filmed YouTube videos along the way, keeping viewers updated with his progress.<br />On March 28, he rented a 2-bedroom apartment in Philadelphia through a website called Evolve. The apartment is owned by 74-year-old Janet McDaniel. <br />“I’m Frank, I’m the person you’re looking for. I’m surprised it took so long,” James told police as they arrested him, police sources said.<br />Mohammed Chikh, who alerted police and witnessed the arrest, said James appeared calm and unfazed.  “He didn’t fight, he didn’t do anything, he totally surrendered,” said Chikh.<br />The New York Post also added:  Federal prosecutors wasted no time charging James, 62, with terror-related offenses for firing 33 rounds on a Manhattan-bound N train Tuesday morning, leaving 10 people with gunshot wounds and another 19 injured in a mass shooting that shocked an already rattled city that’s been reeling from a citywide crime surge. <br />They hit him with a charge of committing terrorist attacks and other violence against mass transportation systems, which could send him to prison for life if he’s convicted.<br />Police arrested James just before 2 p.m. at First Avenue and St. Mark’s Place and about 2 hours later, he was walked from the 9th Precinct, grinning as cops shoved him into a waiting police car. <br />During an afternoon press conference, Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement:  “My fellow New Yorkers: We got him, we got him.

The company released a statement to http://News.com.au confirming that it complied with the CCP’s censorship request. It read:As a studio, we’re committed to safeguarding the integrity of every film we release, and that extends to circumstances that necessitate making nuanced cuts in order to respond sensitively to a variety of in-market factors. Our hope is to release our features worldwide as released by their creators but historically we have faced small edits made in local markets.WB is “Committed to safeguarding the film’s integrity?” But circumstances may “necessitate making nuanced cuts?” To “sensitively” respond to certain “in-market factors?” What a load of tripe. Would WB have made the same “nuanced” cuts to appease American Christians? Of course not. We all know that. It would have called them intolerant bigots. But China can dictate the content of its movies. (As can some Muslim nations, as well.) Because, well, that’s different. That’s their culture, and WB doesn’t want to offend the Chinese or their Communist overlords. A thought experiment: would Warner Bros. have publicly admitted today to removing gay dialogue at the behest of Putin’s Russia?The brief scenes/dialogue referenced were excised from Warner Bros. new movie titled \"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.” They were statements Dumbledore made about his same-sex attraction to the character Grindelwald.Warner Bros.

Fort Detrick is the principal U.S. government-run “biodefense” facility, although Franz himself has publicly admitted that “in biology … everything is dual use — the people, the facilities and the equipment.”Metabiota and the DTRAIn late May 2016, Metabiota hired Andrew C. Weber, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to head up its Global Partnerships. Between 2009 and 2014, Weber served as assistant secretary of defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense under then-president Obama.Weber is credited with creating the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) — a combat support agency within the U.S. DoD, specializing in countering weapons of mass destruction, including biological weapons — and as mentioned earlier, the DTRA has reportedly funded Metabiota to operate U.S.-funded biological research labs in Ukraine.The DTRA has also issued a number of grants to the EcoHealth Alliance, totaling at least $37.5 million, including a 2017 grant for $6.5 million to “understand the risk of bat-borne zoonotic disease emergence in Western Asia.”According to a December 2020 report by The Defender, EcoHealth Alliance had tried to hide most of the Pentagon funding that it had received between 2013 and 2020, most of which came from the DTRA.Metabiota’s bungled ebola responseIn 2016, CBS News published a scathing critique of Metabiota’s response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Metabiota had been hired by the WHO and the local government of Sierra Leone to monitor the spread of the epidemic, but according to an investigation by The Associated Press, “some of the company’s actions made an already chaotic situation worse.”In a July 17, 2014, email obtained by AP, Dr. Eric Bertherat, medical officer at the WHO’s Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response, complained about misdiagnoses and “total confusion” at the small laboratory Metabiota shared with Tulane University in Kenema, Sierra Leone.According to Bertherat, there was “no tracking of the samples” and “absolutely no control on what is being done.” “This is a situation that WHO can no longer endorse,” he wrote. Similarly, Sylvia Blyden, special executive assistant to the president of Sierra Leone, told AP Metabiota’s response was a disaster:“’They messed up the entire region,’ she said. She called Metabiota’s attempt to claim credit for its Ebola work ‘an insult for the memories of thousands of Africans who have died.’”",
