We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. Take the oath, that YOU will only speak Truth, live that in your life. To speak anything other than Truth is False Prophecy, that is a Sin. Native tribes of America had no word for deception, it was unheard of to deceive. Ancient cultures illustrated Earth as Level & Stationary. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs, trying to destroy our faith in Creation. Frisbee Disc in Outer Space is disinfo Psyop. Every ocean measures PERFECTLY FLAT, no Curvature has EVER been measured. Earth is Fixed & Stationary, no instrument has EVER detected motion. If Earth orbited the Sun, direction of our midnight sky MUST rotate during that Orbit (simple geometry). Our midnight view of the Stars should rotate 360° during complete orbit, we should see 4 distincly different sets of Constellations. We could NOT possibly see same Stars from opposite sides of Sun. Yet every single Star can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? FACTS do not cease to exist, just because they are ignored. Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Accounts set to 'Private', alt accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed. Purpose for group is to reveal FACTS supporting Flat Earth, we have undeniable evidence to easily prove Level and Stationary Earth.",

Apparently when it finally affects cities and states far from that border.Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency Friday due to the sharp increase in the number of migrants arriving in his city. “El Paso, the city manager, the mayor, they should stop sending buses to New York,” Adams implored.Last week in these pages, City Councilman Joe Borelli saluted the mayor for declaring the emergency and noted that “17,400 migrants have entered New York City since this spring (more than half of whom were sent by the Democratic mayor of El Paso, Texas), and the estimated price tag has ballooned to more than $1 billion. Even in a city with the budget of Switzerland, these figures are daunting.”They are. And they represent a tiny fraction of migrants presenting themselves at the border. According to US Customs and Border Protection, 203,597 people crossed our southwest land border in August alone. For comparison, that number was 62,707 in August 2019. Suddenly 17,400 over the course of several months doesn’t seem like New York’s fair share.New York City Mayor Eric Adamshttps://gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748Contact:http://ericadams2021.comhttps://www.facebook.com/80559174013https://www.instagram.com/ericadamsfornycPeople in PoliticsPage 1 https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087",

Apparently when it finally affects cities and states far from that border.<br /><br />Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency Friday due to the sharp increase in the number of migrants arriving in his city. “El Paso, the city manager, the mayor, they should stop sending buses to New York,” Adams implored.<br /><br />Last week in these pages, City Councilman Joe Borelli saluted the mayor for declaring the emergency and noted that “17,400 migrants have entered New York City since this spring (more than half of whom were sent by the Democratic mayor of El Paso, Texas), and the estimated price tag has ballooned to more than $1 billion. Even in a city with the budget of Switzerland, these figures are daunting.”<br /><br />They are. And they represent a tiny fraction of migrants presenting themselves at the border. According to US Customs and Border Protection, 203,597 people crossed our southwest land border in August alone. For comparison, that number was 62,707 in August 2019. Suddenly 17,400 over the course of several months doesn’t seem like New York’s fair share.<br /><br />New York City Mayor Eric Adams<br /><a href=\"https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>gab.com/Agitators/posts/107586971331472748<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Contact:<br /><a href=\"http://ericadams2021.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>ericadams2021.com<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/80559174013\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>facebook.com/80559174013<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ericadamsfornyc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>instagram.com/ericadamsfornyc<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />People in Politics<br />Page 1 <a href=\"https://gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>gab.com/Agitators/posts/108487037613807087<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a>",

The bottom line is they realistically have no idea what they’re talking about. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”. (The Hebrew Roots Movement as well as Roman Catholicism are both a cult AND a false religion, Biblically-speaking.) Sadly, Matthew 7:21-23 and 2 Timothy 3:5 are STELLAR descriptions of those types of “salvation by works” cults and false religions. “I’m glad I listened,” before it’s too late ALWAYS sounds better than, “I wish I’d listened,” when it is. (SIDE NOTE: Salvation’s a GIFT, not a “WAGE” (Romans 6:23). The Lord is The CreatOR while we’re merely the creatED.)A “cult” is deemed so because it claims to have faith in Jesus (wrong “Jesus”, but that’s another story), quote Scripture passages (WAY out of Biblical context) and fails to follow Him and Him ALONE. They do a good job of telling people about Jesus but fail to teach anyone about the finished work of Jesus or His Resurrection. There’s ALWAYS someone else as a “leader”. Examples: Charles “Taze” Russell of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Moses of the Hebrew Roots Movement (an offshoot of the false religion of Judaism), the pope/a priest/Mary of Roman Catholicism, Mary Baker Eddy of Christian Science, Joseph Smith of Latter Day Saints, L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology, Ellen White of Seventh Day Adventism, Eric vonAnderseck of Second Eighth Week Apostles and so on. Additionally, there are no contradictions in Scripture...EVER.An incorrect version of “Jesus” exists in ANY cult which includes those “salvation by works” people. It’s totally impossible to “earn a gift”. No “Jesus” in false religions. One doesn’t HAVE TO do things pertaining to Christianity, he or she GETS to. HUMONGOUS difference.) Christianity doesn’t teach anything like either “salvation by works” or “religion” (see Romans 6:23 for more information). Additionally, Scripture is BEYOND clear in 2 Corinthians 5:8 (absent with the body = present with The Lord). By contrast, salvation is “Just Jesus. No artificial anything”. (“The Gospel ONLY”, in other words – Keyword: “ONLY”). Someone born again is only qualified to teach the new covenant (see 2 Corinthians 3:4-11 for more information). Forever’s a long time.Will cheerfully do what The Lord says instead. Feel free to take matters up with The Author if there’s some “problem” with how He writes His Own Book. That 1-on-1 with The Lord happens with 100% of everyone whether he or she “believes that way or not” (see Hebrews 9:27-28). Confidence on the Day of Judgment is critical. Psalm 118:8 implies that it’s better to trust in The Lord than it is to put confidence in man.(SIDE NOTE: The term “Christ” is a title, not a name. It means either “The Anointed One” or “Messiah”.)Rather than ask, “What would Jesus do?” Perhaps instead inquire as to what He may be doing in you.In Hebrews 10:14, “For all time” means (may I have a drumroll, please) “For all time”.

          "contentraw": "2 of 2 -<br />There are literally dozens of each, cults and false religions but if you’re born again (or “born from above” – or “born anew” – John 3:1-6 – <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/greek/509.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>biblehub.com/greek/509.htm<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a> ), feel free to ignore every single one of them. The bottom line is they realistically have no idea what they’re talking about. Some of the more mainstream of these who tend to focus on that “salvation by works” stuff (despite Matthew 5:13-16, Isaiah 64:6, Romans 11:6, Ephesians 2:8-10 and Titus 3:4-8) are (on the cult side) Seventh Day Adventism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, the Hebrew Roots Movement and Roman Catholicism. On the false religions side, it’s Judaism which denies Jesus as The Messiah in lieu of that now-obsolete Mosaic Law of the B.C. Era, again the Hebrew Roots Movement which tries to blend Calvary and Mosaic Law (they do not blend) and again Roman Catholicism which also tries that “blend” thing along with a long list of “traditions”.
