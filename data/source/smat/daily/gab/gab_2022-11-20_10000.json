            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180Â° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Eric has been paid millions to clean the voter rolls and has done nothing to clean. But what have they done?Well lets look at what is possible with the special access ERIC has.First they have access to the DMV and the Bureau of Vital Statistics. (This is illegal in most states to give out people personal information to a non governmental entity.) So now they can take the voter rolls and compare them to the other databases to know who is eligible to register that is not registered. Then ERIC can run these lists against Lexus/Nexus and AI. To determine the likelihood of voting liberal versus conservative. If even more nefarious ERIC can predict those least likely to vote at all as well using AI. If done well and having admin access, they can add all the voter registrations they want using scripts in the database. Adding either the people they want to vote and having voter registration cards mailed out. Or adding all the registrations the data indicates will not vote.This process explains how 61 million voter registrations happened after Nov 1 2020 and before Nov 7 2020.If you add admin access to the voting database you could run scripts to vote for those newly created voter registrations. But that would take pausing the counting for 4-6 hours. Hummmmm I wonder if that explains why the elections are no longer finished counting the night of the election.",

So I will not allow him to be on Intel. You have Adam Schiff, who lied to the American public time and again. We will not allow him to be on the Intel committee either. Look, Congresswoman Omar, her anti-semitic comments that have gone forward, weâre not going to allow her to be on Foreign Affairs, but weâre also going to stand up to whatâs happening not just in the halls of Congress, but whatâs happening to our higher education institutions, the antisemitism thatâs going on on these campuses and others. Weâll investigate that as well and stop this to make sure that America does have the freedom that we said we would keep, and we will stand up to it as we move forward with.â",

            "description": "WARNING - this group may cause original thoughts to develop and have you questioning your programmed and indoctrinated thinking. We were fed a well-packaged web of lies, gradually over several generations. While to young to think for ourselves, they brainwashed us with false beliefs. They seek to destroy our faith in the Great Architect, our Creator. Science expects you deny your lying eyes and worship they're Graven Image, the Globe. Science claims we evolved from pond scum, crawled out of the sea and grew legs. Every ancient culture has always depicted Earth as Level and Stationary as described in scripture. Nobody believed that spinning globe until gov't education. Let's examine the evidence . . Every ocean measures perfectly Flat, no curvature has ever been measured. We've shot lasers and zoomed our cameras over impossible distances, globe geometry completely fails. No instrument known to man, has ever detected any motion of Earth. The mechanical gyroscope proves Earth does not move. During winter, darkness would face 180Â° opposite than summer. We could not possibly see all the same stars from opposite sides of the sun. Every star seen from Earth, can be seen every night of the year. Not one star ever leaves the view from Earth, how could that be true if Earth orbited the Sun ? Some may ask to see an edge, why must there be an edge ? Antarctica is not a southern continent, it's an encircling ice wall that forms a barrier. \"Antarctic Treaty\" prohibits all private research. Why do they hide Antarctica from us ? Purpose for this group is to present the REAL evidence supporting  and validating the Flat Earth. With extensive and undeniable Evidence, clearly and easily defining the true nature of our Earth. We're at a time, where if you know the truth and do not speak it, you're no better than those who deceive us. This group is family friendly, act accordingly (language), Racist statements WILL get you banned. Alternate accounts, ban evaders, dis-info shills, controlled opposition, and proven liars, may be removed. Accounts who rudely take over feeds, ignoring or changing topic, engaging in threats or insults, may be removed.",

Their clothing may be simple, but it is beautiful, and highlights the strength and grace of a woman or mother. You might also see women who like to make their own clothing that is modest and graceful, or read stories from women who receive proper respect due to their feminine attire in their day to day lives.

These were mostly Black and White.\nWhen the families moved to better school districts it left the liberal cities a void.\nThat void was filled with illegal aliens.\nThis created inequalities and segregation. \nIt also led to drive-by-shootings and violence in the schools. \nGang wars pitted the immigrants against one another and blacks.\nTeachers wouldn't teach in violent cities and left those kids to be educated by subpar teachers.\n\nClimate alarmism was created by the United Nations and introduced to congress by Nancy Pelosi in 1992 as Agenda 21.\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/353\nThe United Nations wants to be unelected global leaders with open borders.\nPelosi made her open borders stance clear when in 2016 she flew to Mexico City and got former\nMexico President Vicente Fox to declare Trump voters as \"lazy drunks\".\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/pelosi-vicente-fox-plot-to-defeat-trump-mexican-calls-trump-voters-lazy-drunks\n\nCalifornia's Governor Newsom within a week after defending his recall, made a law by decree that every neighborhood would have to provide affordable housing. With low income high density housing comes public transportation, light rail, dedicated bus lanes, bicycle trails, removing lanes from streets.\n\nAgenda 21 envisioned returning land back to nature, which explains Obama's and Biden's land grab. \n\nObama:\nSince taking office, Iâve set aside more than 260 million acres of public lands and waters â more than any President in history.\nhttp://news.investors.com/politics-andrew-malcolm/102415-777311-obama-protecting-the-land-is-important.htm\n\nUnder guise of climate change, Biden wants to make 30% of U.S. land off limits Expanded government plan means he's coming for private property\nhttps://www.wnd.com/2021/09/biden-plan-means-coming-private-property-wants-make-30-us-land-off-limits/\n",
