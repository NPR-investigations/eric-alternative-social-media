Erick Estrada<br /><br />Texas officials are clarifying the events leading up to Tuesday's tragic mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, which claimed the lives of at least 19 students, a teacher and one other adult.<br /><br />In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, Sgt. Erick Estrada, Texas Dept. of Public Safety, said there were two separate shootings that took place.<br /><br />Texas Gov. Greg Abbott previously announced the shooter — identified as Uvalde resident Salvador Romas — is dead.<br /><br />\"The first incident was involving the suspect at their grandmother's residence, where he shot the grandmother, and then the grandmother was airlifted,\" Estrada said.<br /><br />The second incident, which Estrada said was initially called in as a crash \"and a man with a firearm outside [Robb Elementary] school premises,\" resulted in the shooting deaths of at least 21 people.<br /><br />\"The suspect did crash near a ditch here nearby the school. That's where he exited his vehicle with [what] I believe was as rifle,\" Estrada said.<br /><br />\"What got reported was that a man with a gun had crashed nearby the Robb Elementary School,\" he later added. \"He was observed exiting the vehicle with his own rifle and a backpack. He also had body armor with him.\"<br /><br />Estrada also confirmed that he was wearing the body armor.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://people.com/crime/uvalde-school-shooter-shot-his-grandmother-before-driving-to-robb-elementary-school-officials/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>people.com/crime/uvalde-school-shooter-shot-h<span class=\"invisible\">is-grandmother-before-driving-to-robb-elementary-school-officials/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Together this 'dream team' of Marxism believes they have the right to call Americans- 'radical revolutionaries' for defending the American Republic. Holder, casting shame on Americans for defending our Constitutional Republic, often forgets his radical past. In other words- It's ok when he does stuff- it is not ok when Republicans defend President Donald J. Trump or the US Constitution or talk about a Conservative",

Eric Holcomb. The Republican had issued his veto in March, as Madeline reported at the time. The legislation was designed to prohibit biological males from competing in women's sports for K-12 schools. Now, over a dozen states have passed laws to do just that, while Demoncraps talk a big talk but in reality are looking to change women's sports as we know it in the name of \"equality.\"Arika Herron, a reporter for the Indianapolis Star did a write-up on and tweeted about the final vote, which was 67-28 in the House and 32-15 in the Senate. The law will take effect on July 1. Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), who represents Indiana's 3rd Congressional District, had been in favor of a veto override from the start. In March, he urged the General Assembly to \"override the veto and send a message to the rest of the nation that Indiana values women.\"",

Eric Holcomb. The Republican had issued his veto in March, as Madeline reported at the time. The legislation was designed to prohibit biological males from competing in women's sports for K-12 schools. Now, over a dozen states have passed laws to do just that, while Demoncraps talk a big talk but in reality are looking to change women's sports as we know it in the name of \"equality.\"<br /><br />Arika Herron, a reporter for the Indianapolis Star did a write-up on and tweeted about the final vote, which was 67-28 in the House and 32-15 in the Senate. The law will take effect on July 1. <br /><br />Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), who represents Indiana's 3rd Congressional District, had been in favor of a veto override from the start.

The distance from the 40th parallel to the north pole is 3450 miles. Using the determined height of Polaris, 3120 miles we find that it's not 40 but 42 degrees.

According to NYPost at the time, the family of Enriquez had only one message for Mayor Eric Adams:“Do your job … Get crime off the streets.”And they make a crucial point, especially as it relates to this specific attack. Why? Because it was revealed in follow up reporting yesterday that the suspect, 25 year old Andrew Abdullah of Brooklyn (who has now been placed in custody), had “about 20 prior arrests” for “assault, robbery, menacing and grand larceny”, ABC News reported this week. ‘In fact, the same report notes that he has “three cases that are still pending, including an April arrest for fourth-degree criminal possession of stolen property for allegedly being found with a stolen motorcycle, as well as a June 2021 arrest for violating a protective order and March 2021 arrest for assault.”But wait…that’s not all. According to ABC:\"In January 2020, Abdullah was arrested as part of a gun-related case and in May 2017 he was charged with second-degree attempted murder as part of an 83-count federal indictment of the Harlem-based street gangs Fast Money and Nine Block. Abdullah was sentenced to three years in federal prison, but served just four months before being released in 2019.\"",

I have never seen anything like the current supply problems.Not with COVID-19 in 2020, not during Nixon's presidency in 1968 and 1969. Raw materials are in short supply, because good workers cannot be found, because of production line breakdowns, because of COVID-19 variant outbreaks, because the automotive industry let themselves run out of everything, because freight rates have increased and now, because of a Hitler doppelganger trying to start a World War.The cost of metal containers has more than doubled in some cases. We can't get plastic buckets. The prices of all plastic containers have gone up sharply. The main ingredient in metal adhesive has nearly doubled in cost, and freight on the next container of it is expected to double.Prices are up from 5% to 70% with even more increases expected.We hoped to hold our pricing until costs came back down. That was a mistake.Now we are faced with having to catch-up because prices are out of control and are apparently not coming back down.We have not offered the usual 30-day notice of the increases because we have already been paying these higher costs. Old prices were below cost in some cases.What we are offering is 10% off the new prices until May 25. This is for one order only, in quantities similar to your usual orders.Unfortunately, if you order more than an average amount, we will have to cut back your order so that everyone can get some product. With supply running considerably behind current demand we cannot let a few customers get the lion's share. I hope you understand.Thank you for your continued business.Best regards, xxxxxxxxx.Coming to your industry and its suppliers soon...https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/letter-us-supplier-industrial-chemicals-i-have-never-seen-anything-current-supply-problems",
