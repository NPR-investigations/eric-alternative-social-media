He’s speaking of how the heart of man molds trust to bring forth fruit unto himself.<br /><br />Hosea 10:1<br />Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.<br /><br />✅ Listen to the audio teaching and learn anew how God speaks to His church today to free your faith from these philosophical strongholds.<br /><br />➡ <a href=\"http://s8w.org/idccst-online-course\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">http://<\/span>s8w.org/idccst-online-course<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br /><a href=\"/tags/pray\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#pray<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/godislove\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#godislove<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Jesuslovesme\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Jesuslovesme<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/christians\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#christians<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/churchonline\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#churchonline<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/Godisgood\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#Godisgood<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/ourgodisawesome\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#ourgodisawesome<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/graceandpeace\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#graceandpeace<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/praying\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#praying<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/holyghost\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#holyghost<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/prophetic\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#prophetic<\/a> insight <a href=\"/tags/prophecy\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#prophecy<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/christianlifestyle\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#christianlifestyle<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/qotd\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#qotd<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/fruitfulness\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#fruitfulness<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/abiding\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#abiding<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/biblestudy\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#biblestudy<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/online\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#online<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/firstlove\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#firstlove<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/bless\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#bless<\/a> sing <a href=\"/tags/podcast\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#podcast<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/churchonline\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#churchonline<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/audio\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#audio<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/teaching\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#teaching<\/a> <a href=\"/tags/preaching\" class=\"hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#preaching<\/a>",

The test, overseen by leader Kim Jong Un, was conducted on Thursday at North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Ground which has been used to test missile technologies, including rocket engines and space launch vehicles, the official KCNA news agency reported on Friday.    Experts say the test appears aimed at developing a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) given the thrust of the engine, which the North said was “the first of its kind” in the country.    North Korea has been working to build more solid-fuel missiles that are more stable and can be launched with almost no warning or preparation time.    “Compared to liquid-propellant weapons, solid-fuel missiles are more mobile, quicker to launch, and easier to conceal and use during a conflict,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.    “Once deployed, the technology would make North Korea’s nuclear forces more versatile, survivable, and dangerous.”    Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at Kyungnam University in South Korea, said the latest test signals North Korea’s push to build more powerful ICBMs and submarine-launched ballisitc missiles (SLBMs).    “We cannot rule out the possibility of the North test-firing an ICBM with a new solid-fuel rocket next year,” Lim said.    …    Developing a solid-fuel ICBM was part of the North’s five military tasks rolled out at its key party meeting last year.    After overseeing the test, Kim said “another important problem in carrying out the five priority tasks” was successfully solved, and expressed “expectation that another new-type strategic weapon would be made in the shortest span of time,” according to KCNA.At this point, North Korea could probably single-handedly win a war against America.People really have no idea how bad things have gotten.The people at the Pentagon don’t really seem to understand that you can’t win a war with a bunch of vaxed-up faggots in BDSM gear.Meanwhile: US Army Investigates Sadomasochist “Pup Kink” Furry Officers",

          "content": "Mayor Eric Adams’ billion-dollar migrant problem is in reality an at least $3 billion fiscal nightmare that will continue to strain New York City finances for years, a daunting new analysis by city Comptroller Brad Lander reveals. Lander’s annual “State of the City’s Economy and Finances” report, published late Thursday, finds that the city’s budget should include a projected $1 billion annually in spending through 2026 to cover costs tied to housing, educating and feeding migrants — especially with the expiration of the ‘Title 42’ federal border policy on Dec. 21. “Although the number of asylum-seekers arriving from the border has slowed in recent weeks after a change in U.S. policy, that policy is now under a Federal judge’s order to end on Dec. 21st, suggesting much is unknown about what these trends portend for the coming months and years,” wrote Lander. “It is also highly unlikely that, even if the inflow of migrants were to diminish considerably in the coming months, the need for services for those already in the DHS and HERRC shelters would drop to zero at the turn of the fiscal year,” he said, referring to the city’s 58 emergency hotels and ‘mega-shelters’ currently under contract to house over 21,000 migrants.“Therefore, barring a strategic plan at the federal, state and city level, the Comptroller’s Office will assume a continued expense of $1 billion.  It is quite possible this amount will be even higher in FY 2024 if the population continues to grow.”Adams submitted a desperate $1 billion funding request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency last month, The Post exclusively reported, but the agency told The Post they’re still accessing the application – meaning right now there’s no funding guarantee.Now, City Hall is worried that the end of the pandemic-related Title 42 immigration policy will restart the relentless crush of immigrants flowing into the Big Apple from the southern border since spring.Hizzoner slammed the federal government and Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday – declaring “no one” is coming to the city’s rescue.“We have not gotten a dime from anyone. That has to stop. We need help,” an exasperated Adams said during an unrelated press conference at City Hall.https://nypost.com/2022/12/16/nyc-faces-1b-a-year-for-migrants-through-2026-brad-lander/",
          "contentraw": "Mayor Eric Adams’ billion-dollar migrant problem is in reality an at least $3 billion fiscal nightmare that will continue to strain New York City finances for years, a daunting new analysis by city Comptroller Brad Lander reveals. <br /><br />Lander’s annual “State of the City’s Economy and Finances” report, published late Thursday, finds that the city’s budget should include a projected $1 billion annually in spending through 2026 to cover costs tied to housing, educating and feeding migrants — especially with the expiration of the ‘Title 42’ federal border policy on Dec. 21. <br /><br />“Although the number of asylum-seekers arriving from the border has slowed in recent weeks after a change in U.S. policy, that policy is now under a Federal judge’s order to end on Dec. 21st, suggesting much is unknown about what these trends portend for the coming months and years,” wrote Lander. <br /><br />“It is also highly unlikely that, even if the inflow of migrants were to diminish considerably in the coming months, the need for services for those already in the DHS and HERRC shelters would drop to zero at the turn of the fiscal year,” he said, referring to the city’s 58 emergency hotels and ‘mega-shelters’ currently under contract to house over 21,000 migrants.<br /><br />“Therefore, barring a strategic plan at the federal, state and city level, the Comptroller’s Office will assume a continued expense of $1 billion.  It is quite possible this amount will be even higher in FY 2024 if the population continues to grow.”<br /><br />Adams submitted a desperate $1 billion funding request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency last month, The Post exclusively reported, but the agency told The Post they’re still accessing the application – meaning right now there’s no funding guarantee.<br /><br />Now, City Hall is worried that the end of the pandemic-related Title 42 immigration policy will restart the relentless crush of immigrants flowing into the Big Apple from the southern border since spring.<br /><br />Hizzoner slammed the federal government and Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday – declaring “no one” is coming to the city’s rescue.<br /><br />“We have not gotten a dime from anyone. That has to stop. We need help,” an exasperated Adams said during an unrelated press conference at City Hall.<br /><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/12/16/nyc-faces-1b-a-year-for-migrants-through-2026-brad-lander/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>nypost.com/2022/12/16/nyc-faces-1b-a-year-for<span class=\"invisible\">-migrants-through-2026-brad-lander/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

The test, overseen by leader Kim Jong Un, was conducted on Thursday at North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Ground which has been used to test missile technologies, including rocket engines and space launch vehicles, the official KCNA news agency reported on Friday.    Experts say the test appears aimed at developing a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) given the thrust of the engine, which the North said was “the first of its kind” in the country.    North Korea has been working to build more solid-fuel missiles that are more stable and can be launched with almost no warning or preparation time.    “Compared to liquid-propellant weapons, solid-fuel missiles are more mobile, quicker to launch, and easier to conceal and use during a conflict,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.    “Once deployed, the technology would make North Korea’s nuclear forces more versatile, survivable, and dangerous.”    Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at Kyungnam University in South Korea, said the latest test signals North Korea’s push to build more powerful ICBMs and submarine-launched ballisitc missiles (SLBMs).    “We cannot rule out the possibility of the North test-firing an ICBM with a new solid-fuel rocket next year,” Lim said.    …    Developing a solid-fuel ICBM was part of the North’s five military tasks rolled out at its key party meeting last year.    After overseeing the test, Kim said “another important problem in carrying out the five priority tasks” was successfully solved, and expressed “expectation that another new-type strategic weapon would be made in the shortest span of time,” according to KCNA.At this point, North Korea could probably single-handedly win a war against America.People really have no idea how bad things have gotten.The people at the Pentagon don’t really seem to understand that you can’t win a war with a bunch of vaxed-up faggots in BDSM gear.Meanwhile: US Army Investigates Sadomasochist “Pup Kink” Furry Officers",
