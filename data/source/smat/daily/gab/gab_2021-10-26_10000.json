          "content": "Wisconsin LAB Election Investigation Summary: Dirty Voter Rolls Lead to Dirty Elections  <br /><br />The Wisconsin Legislative Audit Bureau (LAB) was authorized by the Joint Legislative Audit Committee on February 11, 2021 to audit the 2020 election. The LAB review is one of several ongoing election integrity efforts in WI: Special Counsel Mike Gableman is pursing an investigation under the supervision of Speaker Robin Vos and Reps. Janel Brandtjen and Timothy Ramthum continue to fight for a full forensic audit of ballots and machines. <br /><br />LAB released its report on Friday, after receiving limited cooperation from election officials:<br /><br /> ‚Ä¢ Only 2 of 6 Wisconsin Election Commissioners agreed to interview with the auditors;<br /><br />‚Ä¢ The City of Madison (2nd most populous in Wisconsin) and Milwaukee County (most populous) did not allow LAB to physically handle election records, including ballots and absentee ballot certificates, citing chain of custody concerns;<br /><br /> ‚Ä¢ More than half (52%) of state municipal clerks and 18% of county clerks did not respond to the auditors request for information. <br /><br />Despite these barriers, the audit team made several disturbing discoveries. Overall, the findings reinforce Patrick Colbeck‚Äôs determination that election fraud originates with the Qualified Voter File. Dirty voter rolls lead to dirty elections. <br /><br />WEC Ignored National Database That Identifies Potential Problems<br /><br />Among the most alarming revelations in the LAB investigation is the fact that the Wisconsin Election Commission (WEC) did not use the ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center) database to check for fraudulent voters. ERIC allows states to determine if residents are voting in multiple states, have died in other states, moved within the state, voted multiple times in the same election, or are eligible to vote but not registered.<br /><br />It turns out the first time WEC ran an ERIC report on registered voters was in May 2021, after the auditors started poking around. The only ERIC report it ran in 2020 was for eligible voters who weren‚Äôt registered.<br /><br />New Voter Registration Non-Matches<br /><br />In 2020, nearly 1M people registered to vote in WI. This is a shockingly high number given that just under 3.3M people voted in the 2020 WI election and there are only 3.68M registered voters in WI.  <br /><br />LAB found that 45,665 of these newly registered voters signed up with state IDs or driver‚Äôs licenses that did not match DMV records, a potential indication of fraud. The WEC did not even attempt to match IDs on another 13,800 registrations. In total, nearly 60K newly registered voters had no ID verification, which is a violation of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which requires voters to provide a driver‚Äôs license (or social security information) when they register. <br /><br />Read üìë LAB Report<br />Summaryüóû MacIver Institute, UncoverDC",

An additional commissioner provided written testimony, but the other three declined.Also, Auditors were not allowed to physically handle election-related materials from the City of Madison.Auditors tried to survey every municipal clerk in the state, but only 48% responded. Out of the 72 County clerks, 82% responded.Despite these barriers, the Auditors made several explosive discoveries.Among the most alarming problems identified in this audit is how WEC uses the ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center) database. ERIC allows states to determine if residents are voting in multiple states, have died in other states, moved within the state, voted multiple times in the same election, or are eligible to vote but not registered.It turns out WEC had never run a report on whether people were voting in other states or died in other states going back to 2016. The first time it ran the report was in May, after the auditors started poking around. The only ERIC report it ran in 2020 was for eligible voters who weren‚Äôt registered.New Voter Registration Non-matchesThere were also problems with how WEC administered the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which requires voters to provide a driver‚Äôs license (or social security information) when they register. In 2020, 957,977 Wisconsinites registered to be a new voter. Of the 957,977, 898,421 of the new registrations matched corresponding records used as an integrity check at the Department of Transportation or 93.8%. Which means that 45,665 new voters registered with driver‚Äôs license information that did not match DMV records or 4.8%. Each of those mismatches is a potential indication of voter fraud, but WEC was unconcerned.‚ÄúWEC‚Äôs staff instruct clerks to correct the voter registration if they can determine that the non-match was the result of a data entry error. Otherwise, clerks are instructed to inform the individuals that they should resolve the mismatched information,‚Äù the audit explains.According to the Audit, of the 45,665 total non-matches, 63.1 percent were from a name non-match, meaning the name submitted by the new voter on the ballot application did not match the name on file at the DOT. Shockingly, the DOT does not provide WEC with the reason of the non-match, so ‚Äúclerks are uncertain whether a non-match occurred because of only a slight difference in a given individual‚Äôs name, which may indicate little cause for concern, or a significant difference, which may indicate that an individual is attempting to register to vote by using another individual‚Äôs information.‚Äù",

          "contentraw": "Explosive Revelations in Wisconsin‚Äôs 2020 Election Audit Report<br />10/20/2021 | Bill Osmulski<br /><a href=\"https://www.maciverinstitute.com/2021/10/explosive-revelations-in-wisconsins-2020-election-audit-report/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>maciverinstitute.com/2021/10/explosive-revela<span class=\"invisible\">tions-in-wisconsins-2020-election-audit-report/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />The Wisconsin Legislative Audit Bureau released its report on the 2020 election Friday, after receiving limited cooperation from officials.<br /><br />Auditors were able to interview 2 of 6 Wisconsin Election Commissioners. An additional commissioner provided written testimony, but the other three declined.<br /><br />Also, Auditors were not allowed to physically handle election-related materials from the City of Madison.<br /><br />Auditors tried to survey every municipal clerk in the state, but only 48% responded. Out of the 72 County clerks, 82% responded.<br /><br />Despite these barriers, the Auditors made several explosive discoveries.<br /><br />Among the most alarming problems identified in this audit is how WEC uses the ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center) database. ERIC allows states to determine if residents are voting in multiple states, have died in other states, moved within the state, voted multiple times in the same election, or are eligible to vote but not registered.<br /><br />It turns out WEC had never run a report on whether people were voting in other states or died in other states going back to 2016. The first time it ran the report was in May, after the auditors started poking around. The only ERIC report it ran in 2020 was for eligible voters who weren‚Äôt registered.<br /><br />New Voter Registration Non-matches<br />There were also problems with how WEC administered the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which requires voters to provide a driver‚Äôs license (or social security information) when they register. In 2020, 957,977 Wisconsinites registered to be a new voter. Of the 957,977, 898,421 of the new registrations matched corresponding records used as an integrity check at the Department of Transportation or 93.8%. Which means that 45,665 new voters registered with driver‚Äôs license information that did not match DMV records or 4.8%. Each of those mismatches is a potential indication of voter fraud, but WEC was unconcerned.<br /><br />‚ÄúWEC‚Äôs staff instruct clerks to correct the voter registration if they can determine that the non-match was the result of a data entry error. Otherwise, clerks are instructed to inform the individuals that they should resolve the mismatched information,‚Äù the audit explains.<br /><br />According to the Audit, of the 45,665 total non-matches, 63.1 percent were from a name non-match, meaning the name submitted by the new voter on the ballot application did not match the name on file at the DOT. Shockingly, the DOT does not provide WEC with the reason of the non-match, so ‚Äúclerks are uncertain whether a non-match occurred because of only a slight difference in a given individual‚Äôs name, which may indicate little cause for concern, or a significant difference, which may indicate that an individual is attempting to register to vote by using another individual‚Äôs information.‚Äù",

They found way more stuff than just the information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing. They found State Department emails, they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went through this sex Island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least 6 times. The amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activities by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress, was so disgusting they had gave it to the FBI, and they said we‚Äôre going to go public with this if you don‚Äôt reopen the investigation, and you don‚Äôt do the right thing with timely indictments. I believe, I know ‚Äì and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1 Police Plaza in New York ‚Äì the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they‚Äôve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the Justice Department with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric garner ‚Äì the guy, almost two years ago ‚Äì that‚Äôs the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually speaking justice in these email and other related criminal matters. You know there‚Äôs five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations of these things with constant down-drafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the ‚Äì I hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president ‚Äì we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen I believe since 1860.<br /><br />The above interview excerpts from 2016 includes insights into the contents of Weiners laptop which also align with Sidney Powell‚Äôs statements on the situation. These insights do not come from just any regular people, but from significant players.<br /><br />What Q Told Us About Eric Prince<br />Q has mentioned Eric Prince a few times, but let‚Äôs take a look at Qanon post #1365. It basically includes screenshots referencing Erik Prince and a few other tidbits that we‚Äôve included above during his interview. But pay attention to how Q ends his post:",

Ahmedal Tayeb Elnouman Modawi, 17, is on house arrest and has to wear an ankle monitor until his next appearance in court set for Dec. 15, according to court documents obtained by KPRC.<br />Modawi is allowed to go to school and church. Records show he posted the bond on Oct. 17, but KPRC first reported that on Monday.<br /><br />Police in Houston, Texas, have said that a sergeant found Modawi recklessly driving a white Infiniti G37 in a parking lot. The teen was allegedly doing donuts in the parking lot. The 17-year-old is accused of fleeing police ‚Äúat a high rate of speed‚Äù instead of submitting to a traffic stop. Authorities said this decision had deadly consequences.<br /><br />‚ÄúModawi, the driver of the Infiniti, evaded and drove at a high rate of speed on Fairdale Lane where he struck three pedestrians,‚Äù police wrote about the Oct. 1 nighttime incident. ‚ÄúThe Infiniti then flipped and struck a fixed object.‚Äù<br /><br />Cops identified the victims as Fnan Measho, 18, Eric Orduna, 22, and Nick Rodriguez, 23, according to KTRK. They were valet drivers at Prospect Park Sports Bar. Incidentally, Modawi was also a valet, but at Cafe Mawal.",

I asked him how that renewable thing was doing. He laughed, then got serious \"If you really intend to adopt electric vehicles, you have to face certain realities.\"<br /><br />\"For example, a home charging system for a Tesla requires 75 amp service. The average house is equipped with 100 amp service. On our small street (approximately 25 homes), the electrical infrastructure would be unable to carry more than three houses with a single Tesla each. For even half the homes to have electric vehicles, the system would be wildly over-loaded. This is the elephant in the room with electric vehicles. Our residential infrastructure cannot bear the load.\"<br /><br />So, as our genius elected officials promote this nonsense, not only are we being urged to buy these things and replace our reliable, cheap generating systems with expensive new windmills and solar cells, but we will also have to renovate our entire delivery system! This later \"investment\" will not be revealed until we're so far down this deadend road that it will be presented with an 'OOPS...!' and a shrug.<br /><br />Eric test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors and he writes, \"For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine.\" Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran on the battery. So, the range including the 9-gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles.<br /><br />It will take you 4.5 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip, your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.<br /><br />According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery. The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned, so I looked up what I pay for electricity.<br /><br />I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh. 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery. $18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery. Compare this to a similar size car with a gasoline engine that gets only 32 mpg. $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 Mpg = $0.10 per mile.<br /><br />The gasoline powered car costs about $25,000 while the Volt costs $46,000 plus. So, the Government wants us to pay twice as much for a car, that costs more than seven times as much to run and takes three times longer to drive across the country.<br /><br />WAKE UP NORTH AMERICA!!!!!!!",

Detention and even arrests weren‚Äôt enough to curb fights on campus. So, a group of dads stepped up, and have committed to being present at the school every day. There hasn‚Äôt been a fight in over a month, and now kids say they love going to school.<br /><br />They call themselves ‚ÄúDads on Duty,‚Äù replete with sweatpants, gas station coffee, and dad jokes worthy of eye rolls. They fist bump students in hallways,&nbsp;providing a fathering gauntlet that is deterring fights and decreasing gang activity. ‚ÄúNot everybody has a father figure at home ‚Äì or a male, period, in their life,‚Äù one of the dads told&nbsp;CBS News.<br />&nbsp;<br />The crisis in Shreveport required more than good intentions. It required&nbsp;fathers. After all, God created dads for just this kind of thing. I love how these dads stepped up and stepped in. THeir actions offer a real life example of the difference it makes when we find ways to answer four simple questions: What good can we celebrate? What‚Äôs missing that we can offer?

Contrairement √† ce qui a √©t√© dit, une vie n‚Äôest pas une vie et quand un jeune meurt, pire un enfant, c‚Äôest un scandale.<br /><br />Deux jeunes sont d√©c√©d√©s des suites d‚Äôun vaccin, un √©tudiant en m√©decine de 24 ans √† Nantes √† cause de l‚ÄôAstraZeneca, non recommand√© aux personnes non √¢g√©es √† la suite d‚Äôautres d√©c√®s, une jeune lyc√©enne √† Gardanne √† cause du Pfizer. Si des ant√©c√©dents familiaux sont privil√©gi√©s par les autorit√©s de sant√© pour expliquer ce d√©c√®s brutal, il est clair que le champ des contre-indications vis-√†-vis des vaccins ARNm a √©t√© bien trop restreint par le minist√®re de la Sant√© avec son d√©cret accompagnant la loi sur le pass sanitaire. Au moment o√π les pays scandinaves renoncent √† vacciner leur jeunesse avec le Moderna, il appara√Æt qu‚Äô√† la non-efficacit√© sur le long terme de ces vaccins s‚Äôajoute la dangerosit√© potentielle sur le court terme.<br /><br />Pourquoi ne crie-t-on pas au scandale ? Pourquoi les politiques et les journalistes d√©tournent-ils le regard et font-ils comme si tout √©tait sans asp√©rit√© et, surtout, sans danger ? Pourquoi transformer l‚Äôinformation en propagande, la politique sanitaire en politique autoritaire ? Comment un pr√©sident de la R√©publique a-t-il pu s‚Äôengager personnellement aupr√®s des adolescents de son pays en les encourageant √† la vaccination, leur assurant que les effets secondaires √©taient tr√®s rares ?...<br /><br />Voir aussi : Olivier V√©ran et les chiffres de l'ANSM : Eric Verhaeghe met le ministre au d√©fi de la v√©rit√©<br /><br />En tant que sp√©cialiste du sacrifice dans les religions, j‚Äôy vois un retour de ce que j‚Äôappelle ¬´ la logique du sacrifice ¬ª. Ren√© Girard a b√¢ti l‚Äôessentiel de son ≈ìuvre de penseur sur cette notion. S‚Äôil avait raison, comme d‚Äôautres avant lui, de remarquer que le sacrifice est bien souvent le meurtre ritualis√© d‚Äôun bouc √©missaire, les raisons de ce meurtre n‚Äô√©taient gu√®re convaincantes. En effet, Girard consid√©rait que le sacrifice √©tait l‚Äôaboutissement d‚Äôun pic de violence √† l‚Äôint√©rieur d‚Äôune soci√©t√© qui trouvait sa r√©solution par la canalisation de cette violence sur une seule personne ou un seul animal. Et il pensait que la violence provenait de la rivalit√© des hommes, mus par un d√©sir mim√©tique ‚Äì jaloux, envieux ‚Äì, qui risquait de faire imploser la soci√©t√©.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.francesoir.fr/opinions-tribunes/vaccination-la-logique-du-sacrifice\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>francesoir.fr/opinions-tribunes/vaccination-l<span class=\"invisible\">a-logique-du-sacrifice<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Citing the CFA judgement is meaningless here as it fails to address how the rights warranted are applied in this case‚Ä¶<br /><br />10/x In paras 64, the court says that it cannot see the defendant recognised his right to free speech and free assembly, but failed to acknowledge the restrictions of his rights‚Ä¶<br /><br />11/x Again the court fails to recognise its own failure of not seeing the restrictions of restricting free speech under international human rights law<br />¬∑<br />12/x Finally in para 65, the court says the defendant only ‚Äúdepended and stressed on the rights in the Basic Law‚Äù, but ‚Äúostensibly ignored the GRAND PRINCIPLE of article 1 of the Basic Law: HKSAR is inseparable from PRC‚Äù‚Ä¶<br /><br />13/x However, the court does not go further to explain why upholding free speech that doesn‚Äôt lead to imminent violence is irreconcilable with upholding territorial integrity of <a href=\"/tags/PRC\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#PRC<\/a>‚Ä¶<br /><br />14/x As our briefing paper stressed, the Johannes Principle forbids any criminalisation of non-violent activities that do not bring imminent violence. The <a href=\"/tags/HK\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#HK<\/a> gov had appreciated the Principles in 2003‚Ä¶<br /><br />15/x Para 65 implies that, the court is now eager to replace human rights jurisprudence with sovereignty jurisprudence. It confuses the public that protecting human rights subordinates to defending the national security and territorial interests of the sovereignty‚Ä¶<br /><br />16/x Yet if the court follows international standard to give ruling, such tensions can be reconciled, and such dichotomy would not exist‚Ä¶<br /><br />17/x This verdict affirms the expansive, arbitrary power under the incitement offences of the NSL. Indeed, incitement has been a controversial charge in the history of common law. Without rigorous analysis between human rights and national security, a low quality judgement comes.<br /><br />18/x Ma‚Äôs sentence will be announced next month by judge <a href=\"/tags/StanleyChan\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#StanleyChan<\/a>, who also tries another speech crime case of <a href=\"/tags/TamTakChi\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#TamTakChi<\/a> (<a href=\"/tags/Âø´ÂøÖ\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#Âø´ÂøÖ<\/a>), whereas Tong Ying Kit‚Äôs appeal is not scheduled yet‚Ä¶<br /><br />19/x There are still many issues that worth discussion in this verdict, but I would stop here for now.
