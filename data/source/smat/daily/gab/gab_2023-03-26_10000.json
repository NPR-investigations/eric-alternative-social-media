A 79-page report of the ordinance issued by the City Council on the day of the vote in part states such caps on gas stations \"is a growing trend for local municipalities due to health and environmental concerns with the continued use of gasoline powered vehicles and equipment.\"    The reports also states gas station \"bans may also be seen as promoting the use of electric vehicles.\" -Just the NewsThe report acknowledges that gasoline is still required for non-electric vehicles.\"The proposal for a cap but not a full ban on new gasoline and automobile service stations is in recognition that there will continue to be some demand for gasoline and automobile service stations as more EVs enter the market and gasoline vehicles are transitioned out of the market over time,\" it reads.The proposal included letters from the community in support of the ordinance.\"I strongly support and encourage you to not allow the further construction of fossil fuel refueling stations (gas) in our community. All of us, not just the citizens of our community, need to move quickly away from fossil fuel consumption,\" reads one letter from resident Channah Horst.\"If you are a climate denier then my plea falls on deaf ears.
