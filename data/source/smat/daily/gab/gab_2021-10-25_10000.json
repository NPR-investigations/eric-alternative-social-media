ERIC allows states to determine if residents are voting in multiple states, have died in other states, moved within the state, voted multiple times in the same election, or are eligible to vote but not registered.<br /><br />It turns out WEC had never run a report on whether people were voting in other states or died in other states going back to 2016. The first time it ran the report was in May, after the auditors started poking around. The only ERIC report it ran in 2020 was for eligible voters who weren’t registered.<br /><br />There were also problems with how WEC administered the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which requires voters to provide driver’s license (or social security information) when they register. In 2020, 957,977 Wisconsinites registered to be a new voter. Of the 957,977, 898,421 of the new registrations matched corresponding records used as a integrity check at the Department of Transportation or 93.8%. Which means that 45,665 new voters registered with driver’s license information that did not match DMV records or 4.8%. Each of those mismatches is a potential indication of voter fraud, but WEC was unconcerned.<br /><a href=\"https://www.maciverinstitute.com/2021/10/explosive-revelations-in-wisconsins-2020-election-audit-report/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>maciverinstitute.com/2021/10/explosive-revela<span class=\"invisible\">tions-in-wisconsins-2020-election-audit-report/<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

They just hired the cEO of GoogleHealth and Alphabet. The morning he started he told everyone must get jab. He gave them 24 hours to get exemptions in. I feel large companies they placed evil people at top to destroy those companies. Look at Mayo Clinic board….4-5 Obamaites placed there….including Eric Schmidt. SWA CEO bad too. 🤷🏼‍♀️",

Commentators call him the ‘Jewish Trump’.<br /><br />French elections are next year. The yellow vests/anti vaccine passport protests are growing in numbers. According to Steve Bannon, France and Italy are on the verge of civil war.<br /><br />Keep watching this space. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/eric-zemmour-french-jewish-trump\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/eric-zem<span class=\"invisible\">mour-french-jewish-trump<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

He is a man who embodies the fear of seeing traditional France -- the one of church steeples and the \"baguette\" -- disappear under the blows of jihad and political correctness.<br />The meteoric rise of Zemmour has had a second effect: he has broken a degrading electoral trap in which the French people are stuck.... dividing the right to prevent them from returning to power.<br />From the middle of the eighties until now, the media and the left, together, manufactured an industrial-strength shame-machine to stigmatize as \"racist\" and \"Nazi\" anyone who dared to raise his voice on issues of immigration...<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/17888/france-eric-zemmour\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.<\/span>gatestoneinstitute.org/17888/france-eric-zemm<span class=\"invisible\">our<\/span><span class=\"ellipsis\"><\/span><\/a>",

Most Apple products are actually based on Unix/Linux, but heavily modified to be a locked down system where the user has very little control over their own machine, turning it into something with the same problems as Windows.  I'm not sure about privacy on Apple, but they turned everything over to Eric Holder's DOJ after a brief dispute, so I don't expect them to go to bat for their users again.<br /><br />If you want control over your own computer and restored privacy, get a cheap one and throw a Linux OS on it. I bet you can find an old laptop at the local Salvation Army for next to nothing.  Craig's List, local classifieds, etc.  For something new, there are tons to buy online, from cheap to fancy.",

I think the Vaccine is an unholy farce. It's the culmination of a plan that's been in the works for about as long as I've been alive. Lots of people theorize that it's purpose is to kill people or make them infertile (and that may be the case) but I think the purpose is to see how many people will willingly give up their bodily autonomy to the coercive power of the state. If enough people will then there's nothing they cant get away with. When I was in youth group in high school we met every wed for 2 hours. To this day I remember we watched a string of \"Movies\" about revelations (I wish I could remember the name!) and I've never forgotten those movie. As dumb as it sounds that movie is what I think about every time I look at the world today. Every current rippling through the world seems to be pulling us right to where the bible tells us the world will end up and for the people paying attention I think that gets more real every day.",

It is kind of appropriate that neither men have ancestry in France. The two men are actually friends. Mélenchon attended Zemmour’s 50th anniversary party. They go back a long way because Zemmour used to support all the same causes as Mélenchon. Back in the days of President Mitterand, Zemmour played the progressive role and supported all the causes Jews tend to love: multiculturalism, homosexuality, abortion -- anything which involves wreaking a nation.But in recent years, he has been assigned another role by the Synagogue: replacing Marine Le Pen as the candidate of the Far-Right. Why replace Marine Le Pen? Well, for one, she is incorrigibly stupid. She proved it in her 2017 presidential debate with Macron. Although Marine did everything to suck up to \"Israel\", the Jewish High Priests of the Republic would prefer to have one of their own as the candidate representing “France”.Zemmour is an \"Israel\"-first candidate. The Zionists know people are rebelling against liberal elitism. So, now we have a far-right candidate whose only purpose is to ensure Zionist interests are maintained, no matter who is elected. When terrorist attacks are orchestrated, he says we should follow the example of \"Israel\". When discussing the problem of Muslim integration, he says that Muslims should follow the example of Jews. But one of his co-religionists and \"ideological enemies\", Jacques Attali says that the Jews already control an important part of the French Muslim population, through finance. He thinks that it is a good thing. No doubt, Zemmour thinks it's a good thing. He is financed by some of the most promising names in French Jewish finance",

They go back a long way because Zemmour used to support all the same causes as Mélenchon. Back in the days of President Mitterand, Zemmour played the progressive role and supported all the causes Jews tend to love: multiculturalism, homosexuality, abortion -- anything which involves wreaking a nation.<br /><br />But in recent years, he has been assigned another role by the Synagogue: replacing Marine Le Pen as the candidate of the Far-Right. Why replace Marine Le Pen? Well, for one, she is incorrigibly stupid. She proved it in her 2017 presidential debate with Macron. Although Marine did everything to suck up to \"Israel\", the Jewish High Priests of the Republic would prefer to have one of their own as the candidate representing “France”.<br /><br />Zemmour is an \"Israel\"-first candidate. The Zionists know people are rebelling against liberal elitism. So, now we have a far-right candidate whose only purpose is to ensure Zionist interests are maintained, no matter who is elected. When terrorist attacks are orchestrated, he says we should follow the example of \"Israel\". When discussing the problem of Muslim integration, he says that Muslims should follow the example of Jews. But one of his co-religionists and \"ideological enemies\", Jacques Attali says that the Jews already control an important part of the French Muslim population, through finance. He thinks that it is a good thing. No doubt, Zemmour thinks it's a good thing. He is financed by some of the most promising names in French Jewish finance",

          "content": "drug head fails  The Big Guy<br /><br />A crowd of merely three people showed up at the second day of a private sale of the personal artwork of Hunter Biden over the weekend, from which the President’s son has sought to profit to the tunes of millions off of selling his personal artwork. Commentators have blasted the ethics arrangements of Biden’s art sales, pointing to the events as attempts to monetize the US presidency and allow potential conflicts of interest to funnel large sums of money to a direct relative of Joe Biden.<br /><br />The New York Post reported on details of the younger Biden’s second art sale on Sunday night. An earlier Biden artwork auction in Los Angeles had attracted a larger crowd of elite liberals potentially seeking to lobby for positions of power within the Biden administration, such as Mayor Eric Garcetti. Negative publicity surrounding the ethically rancid event may have deterred interest in Biden’s second multi-million auction.<br /><br />Osvaldo Jimenez, a New York man who described peering in at the younger Biden’s auction after being denied admission, described Hunter’s art as “s***.” Biden has sought to sell individual pieces of art for prices between $75k and $500k. Biden’s art dealer was seen wearing a Camp David hat during the first day of the auction, raising even more questions about the ethical arrangement of the auction. Biden has claimed the auction uses a system in which he won’t learn who pays hundreds of thousands for his paintings, although it’s totally unclear to what degree it’s enforced and credible.<br /><br />Having a drug problem doesn’t make someone a terrible person worthy of public criticism, whereas using one’s status as the President’s son to attempt grifting in millions of dollars selling his personal art represents clear cut corruption and a potential violation of the emoluments clause of the US Constitution.<br /><br />Biden has continued to slander computer store owner John Paul Mac Isaac, suggesting he could’ve somehow arranged for his laptop to be compromised with Russian propaganda and false kompromat.",

          "content": "Always Engage An Experienced Family Law Attorney For Any Family Law Dispute<br /><br />Divorce is not a straightforward experience, and it is made even more difficult when children are involved. In some cases, the two separating parents reach a peaceful arrangement that satisfies both their mutual needs and the requirements of their children. This is, without a doubt - the finest solution for everyone involved.<br /><br />It is known, however, that the very fact that a divorce occurs makes it impossible for the two parents to achieve a fair settlement on anything, or at the very least how their children should be cared for. This is when a family law court and a family law attorney can assist in resolving disagreements in the best interests of the children.<br /> <br />There is a difference in California between the legal custody of the divorcing parents ' children and their physical custody. The differences may seem challenging for parents to grasp, and there is quite a lot of overlap among them. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it is crucial for parents who go through a divorce to understand what these terms mean. Because when the case is heard in court, the issue of custodial arrangements will arise. <br /> <br />The major difference between legal and physical custody is that legal custody applies to the critical decisions about a child made during the duration of his or her dependent life. <br /> <br />Physical custody applies to children's after-divorce living arrangements.

Just on general principles I hope this druggie son of a pedo sells none of them. However, the buyers won't be buying them on merit but rather on influence inside the White House.<br /><br />\"A mere three potential buyers looked over Hunter Biden’s pricey paintings during Day 2 of his New York City show on Sunday — as the gallery owner said he’s unsure whether he’ll throw a party to celebrate the novice artist and presidential scion.<br /><br />Several would-be viewers were also denied admission to the Georges Berges Gallery in Soho amid the admittedly soft launch of Biden’s Big Apple exhibition, which followed a controversial Los Angeles opening attended by guests including Mayor Eric Garcetti, his dad’s nominee for ambassador to India.<br /><br />“You’re not going to see much of a crowd today,” gallery owner Berges said Sunday.<br /><br />When asked if there would be a formal opening of the show, Berges said, “I don’t know.”<br /><br />The Post reported earlier this month that the gallery was using a team of lawyers to vet anyone who wants to see the show, with a source saying there’s “a whole process to get in.”<br /><br />A man who identified himself as “Sal” from New Jersey and a couple he drove in his green Audi were the only visitors Sunday.<br /><br />Sal, who described himself as retired, made two trips inside, spending less than an hour each time.<br /><br />In between, he left the gallery and offered an unexpected appraisal of the work by President Biden’s son.<br /><br />“It’s great. I’m a Republican and I think those were great. His paintings were very good,” he said.<br /><br />Sal said he told Berges he was “shocked” by his own reaction, adding: “I like six of them very much.”<br /><br />But when asked if he planned to buy anything, he said, “We’ll see.”<br /><br />The man who traveled with Sal also called Biden’s artwork “stunning” but suggested it was too rich for his blood when asked if he bought anything.<br /><br />“I’ll only be so lucky,” he said.<br /><br />Biden’s paintings are being offered at prices ranging from $75,000 to $500,000 each, eye-popping amounts that have led critics to raise ethical concerns.",

The Education Ministry tried to rein rapid recruitment expansion, but it kept going for years and quality control struggled to keep up. <a href=\"https://pic.twitter.com/gto4NPHzhd\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://<\/span>pic.twitter.com/gto4NPHzhd<span class=\"invisible\"><\/span><\/a><br /><br />Within a decade, sociologists were noting the \"ant tribe\" (<a href=\"/tags/蚁族\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#蚁族<\/a>) phenomenon: college grads struggling in cities w/ low-pay work/unpaid internships far from what they expected, but persisting with conviction things would turn around and they'd get white-collar job they studied for<br /><br />Now today we're seeing the \"lying flat\" movement, with many finally recognizing that the good <a href=\"/tags/whitecollar\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#whitecollar<\/a> job they expected isn't coming, or isn't worth it, so what's the point of busting your ass in the rat race when you're really just on a hamster wheel?<br />Assuming degree would bring white-collar future was reasonable through early-2000s. Many from older generation especially had that conviction for their kid. Only 5% who took gaokao made it to college in 1977. It was 34% by 1998, but leapt to 56% after 1999 decision. Now it's ~80%<br /><br />So yes, other countries have similar phenomena of devalued college degrees, youth alienation with capitalist rat race, \"<a href=\"/tags/lyingflat\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#lyingflat<\/a>,\" etc. But the circumstances under which it happened in <a href=\"/tags/China\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#China<\/a> are fairly unique, and happened relatively abruptly.<br /><br />That's all not to say there weren't also benefits from the dramatic growth in college grads. And there are undoubtedly scores of people who've lived better lives than they would have without it...<br /><br />But the government also sent scores of students to schools that weren't ready to accommodate them for short-term economic reasons, and into a job market with expectations for jobs that wouldn't be there--just as its own Ministry of Education warned would happen.",
