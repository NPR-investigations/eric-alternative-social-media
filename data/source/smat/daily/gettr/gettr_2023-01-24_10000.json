Berger remains at an undisclosed White Hat hospital as he recovers from grievous wounds sustained during his brush with CIA kidnappers, a source in Gen. Eric M. Smith’s office told Real Raw News.\n\nDuring his week in captivity, the general suffered blunt force trauma to the torso, arms, and legs; a shattered kneecap; and three broken ribs. \n\nThe kidnappers had strapped him to bed while beating him. His left eye was swollen shut. His right ear looked like a cauliflower and his face was swollen.  Fortunately, CT and MRI scans showed no brain damage or internal injuries. \nhttps://realrawnews.com/2023/01/general-berger-wounded-but-recovering/",

If it is, then whoever was informed in the National Archives, should be charged as an accessory in a coverup. Now, I’m wondering how many politicians, present and former, have classified documents in homes and offices. Adam Schiff’s, Nancy Pelosi’s, Chuck Schumer’s office. Barak Obama, Bill & Hillary Clinton’s, Eric Swallowswell’s offices and homes should definitely be searched by the FBI. 🇺🇸",

He channeled his misery into one of his most scalding performances.\n\nTo re-create the vibe, Lennon had the band record the basic track of YER BLUES elbow-to-elbow in a closet. A few weeks after the \"White Album\" was released, Lennon played it with one-off supergroup the Dirty Mac (Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, and Mitch Mitchell) for the Rolling Stones' \"Rock and Roll Circus\". It was also the only Beatles song he played at the Plastic Ono Band gig, released as Live Peace in Toronto 1969.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HEQQ-1rd4A0",

He's busy getting daily nat'l headlines but: in '22 a Chinese bioresearch co. bought 1400 acres in FL not zoned for research but they plan to get approval for it (where's Ron?), gender insanity is in FL grades 4-12, SB7014 which he signed last yr is still protecting FL hosp's IF they use CDC-rec'd COVID treatment (remdesivir & vent's), he appointed 2 pro-machine, pro-ERIC sec's of state, he opposes forensic audits, silent on AZ election fraud, won't declare an invasion and send help to TX, won't talk about machines (FL has dominion or ES&S in all counties), has taken millions from Ken Griffin, backed by Jeb Bush and Paul Ryan. He's a slick GOPe politician. 👎👎👎",
