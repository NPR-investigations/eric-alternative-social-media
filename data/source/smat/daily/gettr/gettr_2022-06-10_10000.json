We here in Missouri are a little more than a little leary of this man, especially after that sleazy thing he pulled off with his hair girl.  He's going to face quite an uphill battle if he insists to try to take the senate seat this fall.  I and many of we Missourians are not ready to support this man for just that reason.  We are more in line with our AG Eric Schmitt.  He is an over the top MAGA man himself, along with Ken Paxton and a few others, suing the big guys over the border.  He is a straight shooter and he deserves to be forwarded.  I would much rather even support Billy Long that Eric Grietens.",
