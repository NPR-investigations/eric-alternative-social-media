Suggestions included same-day voter registration using provisional ballots, early voting expansion to include the weekend before Election Day, automatic felon voting rights restoration, removal of state ID requirements for online voter registration, a ban on foreign contributions to ballot initiatives, expansion of allowed campaign fund expenditures for “things like child care,” and requiring political action committees (PACs) to disclose any spending in the ten days before registering as a PAC and seventeen days before an election.\n\nAdditionally, Hobbs proposed new types of post-election audits, like risk-limiting audits, as well as mandating and streamlining hand count audits. She also suggested adopting Colorado’s practice of using a monthly National Change of Address (NCOA) report to update voter mailing addresses automatically and notify the voter of the change at their old and new address for corrections, as well as allowing Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) data as a first notice of a person moving.\n\nHobbs noted that her list of proposals wasn’t exhaustive.\n\nIn the letter to Senator Karen Fann (R-Prescott), Hobbs cited the need for these election reforms based on lack of closure with the 2020 election.\n\nRead more:\nhttps://azfreenews.com/2021/12/secretary-of-state-hobbs-suggests-expansive-election-reforms/",

          "message": "Eric Wade is a fraud and a liar. He and others such as Dr Young have conspired against Dr Howard Williams with a series of lies attempting to connect him to a \"white supremacist\" - the person in question is me! Although I have never said anything to imply any race is superior to another and never have held any such beliefs. This lie about me is followed by another lie which attempts to connect him to me although we have never interacted in any way. Despite this the claim was made in a \"peer reviewed\" publication which shows how utterly meaningless this term has become and how toxic and unprofessional academia now is.\n\nhttps://howardwilliamsblog.wordpress.com/2021/12/07/helen-young-postmedieval-lies/",
