Eric is the son of Felix Ramirez, who lives in Lake County, FL where Iâ€™m running for US Congress. Felix is very involved with the South Lake Republican club and his local church. \n\nHis son, Eric, grew up in Lake County, FL and was tragically killed in Iraq in 2004 when his unit was ambushed and a bomb went off, blowing up his Humvee. \n\nHis widow and two grown children were there today (pictured above). Ericâ€™s son an daughter were still babies when their father paid the ultimate sacrifice for our nation in 2004. \n\nEric is buried at the Flordia National Cemetery. \n\nIt was an honor to attend the Memorial Day service today and stand with, honor, and pay respect to a Gold Star family from my own district, FL 11. \n\nI look forward to representing Felix and his family when Iâ€™m in Congress, and I look forward to standing strong and tall for all of Americaâ€™s Gold Star families. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸\n\nMay God bless them all! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
