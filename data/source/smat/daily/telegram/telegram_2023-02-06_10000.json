          "message": "University of Wisconsin\nUniversity of Wisconsin, the sacred cow in America’s Dairyland is a bastion of liberal thinking and teaching. One must be careful in communication concerning that organization because in the minds of so many Wisconsinites this bastion of learning is untouchable.  The biggest problem with U of W is there is little or no transparency.  Kind of like the WEC (Wisconsin Election Commission). \n \nHaving said that, clearly the University of Wisconsin system influences enough voting activity across the state to affect election outcomes.  It is estimated that across the system there are 35-40K new Democrats votes each election cycle. Of course, this doesn’t just happen, there is a great deal of well-coordinated activity by several liberal, left-leaning 501C3s.  \n \nThese left leaning 501C3s seem to be performing activities that are outside of the authority or purview of 501C3s.  In a roundabout way, they are managing to have your tax dollars to affect voter registration and GOTV activities for elections. Reportedly, even the WARF (Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation) has committed limited funding to the Morgridge Center election activities. BTW WARF has assets more than $7.81 Billion.  What is interesting about this is that when reviewing their IRS 990 filing, there is no mention of this money.  Really what is $3 M to an organization that has $7.8 B?\n \nThe Civic Nation 501C3 of Washington D.C. with a $16M annual budget is one of those leading the on-campus charge.  Their ALL-IN initiative which focuses on campuses across the nation has been embedded in the U of W for several years now and for all intent and purpose are running things at the Morgridge Center concerning election activity.  We have a lot of work yet to do with open records requests to find supporting documentation on these matters.\n \nAdjudicated Incompetents\nThis is a case where we filed in 13 different counties in order to have the Registers in Probate release the information to us whereby we can prove, without question, that WEC, is once again not properly maintaining their database.  We discovered there were only 803 people listed as Incomp/Inactive in the WisVote database when, in fact, there are more than likely about 16,000 in the state.  We have had the courts dismiss our request and are in the appeals process at this time.  I would ask you, why would the courts not want to provide this information to us?  I find it baffling especially when the WI Judicial got together with WEC and decided to pass only information that was not confidential in each case. Last week at a hearing, the Circuit Court Judge rhetorically said to Attorney Kaardal, “You know where this is going, don’t you?  This will end up at the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nRegarding the use of Voting Machines\nWe have been contacted concerning several townships who do not want to purchase voting machines.  These are jurisdictions where the population is under 7,500 and the local clerks want to rid themselves of these expensive machines they do not trust.  WI law says, municipalities with under 7,500 population do not have to have machines.  The only criteria that has to be met is that of HAVA (Help America Voting Act) who have a requirement for BMD to be available for the handicapped. There are two sides to this story, the other side is a County Clerk who is saying they want all municipalities to be reporting in the same manner.  I can understand that position.\n\nHAVA/ERIC\nWe’ve been gathering information on ERIC (Electronic Registration Information Center) and WEC as to the agreement that is in place.  ERIC currently operates in 31 states (there were 33, Alabama and Louisiana recently dropped out) and we believe that ERIC is operating outside of the law given their access to private information they receive from WISDOT and share with CEIR. We will be filing that suit shortly.",

          "message": "General Eric M. Smith ordnete am Freitag die Inhaftierung von zwei White Hat-Offizieren an, nachdem sie erfahren hatten, dass sie zwei aufeinanderfolgende Polygraphen nicht bestanden hatten, um herauszufinden, ob sie Konstitutionalisten oder insgeheim dem kriminellen Biden-Regime treu ergeben waren, teilten Quellen im Büro des Generals Real Raw News mit .\n\nWie im Dezember berichtet, sagte General Smith, er werde sein Arsenal an Werkzeugen um Polygraphen erweitern, um Verräter aufzudecken. Er hat dieses Versprechen vor zwei Wochen in Kraft gesetzt, nachdem er führende NCIS-Polygraphen rekrutiert hatte, um zu testen, was sich auf über 1.000 Angehörige der Streitkräfte belaufen könnte. Laut unserer Quelle entscheidet der General nach dem Zufallsprinzip und leidenschaftslos, welche Offiziere zuerst einem Polygraph unterzogen werden, da er keinen eindeutigen Beweis dafür hat, dass einer von ihnen ein Verräter ist.\n\nUnsere Quelle konnte nicht sagen, wie viele Männer bisher getestet wurden; Ein Kapitän und ein Oberleutnant, die alle bei Lackland AFB stationiert sind, sind letzte Woche jedoch mehrfach gescheitert. Sie waren einige Stunden im Voraus informiert worden und hatten keine Einwände gegen den Test.\n\nKein Offizier, sagte unsere Quelle, wird nach einem einzigen nicht bestandenen Test beurteilt; Wenn einer durchfällt, erhält er einen Tag Zeit, um sich „zu beruhigen“ – eine ziemlich übliche Praxis bei der Strafverfolgung – bevor er erneut getestet wird. Wenn jemand zwei aufeinanderfolgende Polygraphen nicht besteht, gilt er als „täuschend“, und nur in seltenen Fällen wird ein dritter Test durchgeführt. Polygraphen messen drei biometrische Daten: Blutdruck, Atmung und Hautleitfähigkeit. Wenn sie von einem kompetenten, unvoreingenommenen Prüfer durchgeführt werden, gelten Polygraphen als zu 87-95 % genau, und die Antworten der Befragten werden in Punktzahlen auf einer 5-stufigen Skala umgewandelt, und die Einstellungen werden dadurch quantifiziert: -6 (stark trügerisch), -2 (täuschend), -1 (etwas irreführend), 0 (neutral), +1 (etwas wahrheitsgemäß), +2 (wahrheitsgemäß) und +6 (stark wahrheitsgemäß).\n\nDer Lackland-Kapitän erzielte eine -7 bzw. eine -10; mit anderen Worten, er hat die Talsohle erreicht.\n\n    Unsere Quelle lieferte Beispielfragen:\n    Haben Sie Ihren verfassungsmäßigen Eid aufrechterhalten?\n    Erkennen Sie Joseph R. Biden als rechtmäßig gewählten Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten an?\n    Haben Sie in den letzten 18 Monaten mit Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin korrespondiert?\n    Haben Sie mit unbefugten Personen über White-Hat-Operationen gesprochen?\n    Haben Sie zu irgendeinem Zeitpunkt Befehle von General David H. Berger missachtet?\n    Hast du die White Hats verraten?\n    Beabsichtigen Sie, General Eric M. Smith zu verraten?\n    Haben Sie alle Prüfungsfragen wahrheitsgemäß beantwortet?\n\nUnsere Quelle sagte, dass der Kapitän diese Fragen bei beiden Prüfungen „nicht wahrheitsgemäß“ beantwortet habe.\n\nDem Leutnant wurden ähnliche Fragen gestellt und er scheiterte kläglich.\n\nDa Polygraphen vor Gericht unzulässig sind, wird sich General Smith nicht ausschließlich auf sie verlassen, um die Schuld oder Unschuld eines Beamten zu beurteilen. Er hat jedoch angeordnet, dass die beiden Beamten „festgehalten“ werden, bis sein Verbindungsmann diese Woche in Lackland eintrifft, um sie zu verhören.\n\nAußerdem ist im Moment eine Menge „Ballon“-Wahnsinn im Gange. Wir alle wissen, dass das Regime behauptet, einen vor der Küste von South Carolina abgeschossen zu haben. Wenn ja, war es ein zweiter oder sogar dritter Ballon. White Hats sagen, dass ein Ballon in Montana abgeschossen wurde, wie von Einwohnern von Billings bezeugt wurde.",
