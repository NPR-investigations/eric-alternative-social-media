My super called the cops and two of them were arrested for trespassing.'\n\nOn the sidewalk was written in chalk: 'Eric Bottcher is a pedo child groomer'.\n\nThe attack is just the latest in a recent spate of violent incidents involving drag queen reading events, which critics say are inappropriate for children.\n\nstory",

          "message": "General Berger Names His Replacement\nBy Michael Baxter -December 16, 20224833916\n\nGeneral David H. Berger Thursday night put a quick end to speculation over who would fill his shoes as commander of the White Hat partition of the United States military. He had summoned his council—currently 12 high-ranking officers from all branches of the armed forces—to an encrypted video call to deliver the news: His successor would be Assistant Commandant of The Marine Corps Eric M. Smith, a valiant, battle-hardened officer who had led Marines into combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nHis meritorious accolades are legendary, and Marines revere him.  Afghanistan and Iraq aside, Gen. Smith commanded U.S. Marine Corps Forces Southern Command, 1st Marine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force, and Marine Corps Combat Development Command.\n\nMore recently, he had helped draft the battle plan that allowed a joint Special Operations task force to seize FEMA’s Mount Weather stronghold.\n\nGen. Smith, who was absent the call, would assume command of all White Hat military operations effective January 1, Gen. Berger said, adding that he’d retain authority in the interim.\n\n“General Smith is the right Marine for this job,” General Berger told the council. “Many of you have met him, and know his reputation. The few of you who haven’t will get to know him soon enough. He’s no nonsense. A Marine and a true patriot. He’s gonna shake things up, and you’ll show him the same respect and deference you’ve shown me. I’ll still be around, advising from the lines. But General Smith will be quarterbacking.”",

          "message": "Why China Loves Conservatives\nby Eric Hendriks-Kim\n\n\"In ­China there is a great deal of love for Western conservative authors: The works of Samuel ­Huntington and Leo Strauss, for instance, are studied and admired by Chinese intellectuals and academics. And Chinese interpretations of American politics often parallel those of the American Right. These affinities undoubtedly have many causes, but one shared belief stands out: a profound sense that any ­society, and a healthy one in particular, is held together by an integral, holistic culture...\n\nThe Chinese term for North America’s identity politics—baizuo (“white Left”)—is strongly derogatory. It implies something like “the wild stuff lefty whites say these days.” Even scholars from China’s most liberal faction, such as intellectual historian Xu Jilin, judge North America’s baizuo to be excessive and divisive... To many of a certain age, such as the dissident artist Ai Weiwei, baizuo recalls Mao’s Cultural Revolution (1966–76). The memory of its terror against “class enemies,” committed in the name of cultural equality, leaves these thinkers allergic to progressive hyper-idealism—the kind of idealism that believes egalitarian utopia would materialize if only critics and moderates did not stand in the way of historical progress. They recognize that thought pattern wherever it emerges, and they know that narrowmindedness, coercion, and worse come in its train. No more of that, please...\n\nIndeed, the pseudo-­solidarity of identity politics further atomizes the individual by undermining the legitimacy of inherited cultures. This outcome is not accidental. Progressive liberals seek to weaken the hold of larger cultural collectives by erasing them from their accounts of the social world, accounts they disseminate using their dominance in the West’s humanities and social science departments. Many conservatives in the West criticize this project, and Chinese intellectuals find themselves in agreement.\"\n\n——————————————————\n  READ THE FULL ARTICLE HERE\n——————————————————",

Er hatte seinen Rat – derzeit 12 hochrangige Offiziere aus allen Zweigen der Streitkräfte – zu einem verschlüsselten Videoanruf eingeladen, um die Nachricht zu überbringen: Sein Nachfolger würde der stellvertretende Kommandant des Marine Corps Eric M. Smith sein, ein tapferer, kämpferischer hartgesottener Offizier, der Marines im Irak und in Afghanistan in den Kampf geführt hatte.\n\nSeine verdienstvollen Auszeichnungen sind legendär und die Marines verehren ihn. Abgesehen von Afghanistan und dem Irak befehligte General Smith das Southern Command der US-Marineinfanteriekorps, die 1. Marinedivision, die III. Marine Expeditionary Force und das Marine Corps Combat Development Command.\n\nIn jüngerer Zeit hatte er beim Entwurf des Schlachtplans mitgewirkt, der es einer gemeinsamen Special Operations Task Force ermöglichte, die Festung Mount Weather der FEMA zu erobern.\n\nGeneral Smith, dem der Anruf abwesend war, würde mit Wirkung zum 1. Januar das Kommando über alle Militäroperationen von White Hat übernehmen, sagte General Berger und fügte hinzu, dass er in der Zwischenzeit die Autorität behalten werde.\n\n„General Smith ist der richtige Marine für diesen Job“, sagte General Berger dem Rat. „Viele von Ihnen sind ihm schon begegnet und kennen seinen Ruf. Die wenigen von euch, die es noch nicht getan haben, werden ihn bald genug kennenlernen. Er ist kein Unsinn. Ein Marine und ein wahrer Patriot. Er wird die Dinge aufrütteln, und Sie werden ihm den gleichen Respekt und die gleiche Ehrerbietung entgegenbringen, die Sie mir entgegengebracht haben. Ich werde immer noch in der Nähe sein und von der Leitung aus beraten. Aber General Smith wird Quarterback sein.“\n\nGeneral Berger würde seine Gründe für seinen Rücktritt nicht öffentlich erklären, sagte eine mit dem Anruf vertraute Quelle gegenüber Real Raw News, sagte aber: „Alle Geschichten, die über einen brodelnden Hass zwischen mir und Präsident Trump kursieren, sind stark übertrieben. Wir hatten in letzter Zeit ein paar Differenzen, das ist alles. Meine Gründe sind meine eigenen. Und ich sage Ihnen das alles, General Smith toleriert keine Quacksalbergeschichten über einen Donald-Trump-Klon oder doppeltes Sitzen in Mar-a-Lago, also machen Sie sich klar.
