Soros Funded ERIC Is Now Used in 31 States \n\nAfter decades of fighting to keep voter rolls dirty, Democrats put themselves in charge of the “clean up.” In 2012 they founded the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a left wing voter registration drive disguised as voter roll “accuracy” management. Funded by a grant from the Soros Open Society, ERIC is now controls the voter logs in 31 States, plus D.C.\n\nThe database tracks everything a bad actor would need to influence the outcome of an election. For example TGP explains:\n\n“Member states must not only submit all details on inactive and active voters to ERIC every 60 days. But they must also provide every individual in their states Motor Vehicle Department database, both licensed and ID recipients. This combo of data is breathtaking. It’s everyone who could generate a legal ballot… This data includes names, addresses, DOB, License #, last 4 of social security #, voter activity, phone, email, type of citizenship documentation, and much more!” (See Exhibit A, B)\n\nIn addition ERIC accumulates direct voting data for federal elections. The database records: “the total number of provisional ballots cast; the total number of provisional ballots counted; the total number of provisional ballots uncounted, by reason (if available); the number of new voters who registered and voted on the same day; and the number of updates to a voter’s existing registration submitted on the same day on which they voted.” (See Exhibit A, C)\n\nJust about the only thing that ERIC does NOT want to know is who is voting illegally. Their rules explain that “under no circumstances shall the members transmit any record indicating an individual is a non-citizen of the U.S.” (See Exhibit A, 2b)\n\nIn 2020, ERIC managed to add 17 million new voters to the rolls in time for the November election, three times the 5.7 million they found for Obama’s 2012 re-election when they only had 7 member states. \n\nHanding over the management of our voter rolls and all of our election data to Soros & comrades is a recipe for perennial election sabotage. Ask your state representatives what they’re doing about ERIC. These are the 31 states currently ensnared in the Soros system:\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Washington D.C., West Virginia, Wisconsin\n\nRead 📰 TGP Part 1, DJHJ Media, ERIC Bylaws\nRelated🔎 PILF ERIC-Related DC Lawsuit, Anatomy of the Steal - Phase 1: Dirty Voter Rolls\n\n@LibertyOverwatchChannel\n—",

Soros Funded ERIC Is Now Used in 31 States \n\nAfter decades of fighting to keep voter rolls dirty, Democrats put themselves in charge of the “clean up.” In 2012 they founded the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a left wing voter registration drive disguised as voter roll “accuracy” management. Funded by a grant from the Soros Open Society, ERIC is now controls the voter logs in 31 States, plus D.C.\n\nThe database tracks everything a bad actor would need to influence the outcome of an election. For example TGP explains:\n\n“Member states must not only submit all details on inactive and active voters to ERIC every 60 days. But they must also provide every individual in their states Motor Vehicle Department database, both licensed and ID recipients. This combo of data is breathtaking. It’s everyone who could generate a legal ballot… This data includes names, addresses, DOB, License #, last 4 of social security #, voter activity, phone, email, type of citizenship documentation, and much more!” (See Exhibit A, B)\n\nIn addition ERIC accumulates direct voting data for federal elections. The database records: “the total number of provisional ballots cast; the total number of provisional ballots counted; the total number of provisional ballots uncounted, by reason (if available); the number of new voters who registered and voted on the same day; and the number of updates to a voter’s existing registration submitted on the same day on which they voted.” (See Exhibit A, C)\n\nJust about the only thing that ERIC does NOT want to know is who is voting illegally. Their rules explain that “under no circumstances shall the members transmit any record indicating an individual is a non-citizen of the U.S.” (See Exhibit A, 2b)\n\nIn 2020, ERIC managed to add 17 million new voters to the rolls in time for the November election, three times the 5.7 million they found for Obama’s 2012 re-election when they only had 7 member states. \n\nHanding over the management of our voter rolls and all of our election data to Soros & comrades is a recipe for perennial election sabotage. Ask your state representatives what they’re doing about ERIC.

          "message": "Who’s ‘Cleaning’ Our Voter Rolls? Soros Funded ERIC Is Now Used in 31 States \n\nAfter decades of fighting to keep voter rolls dirty, Democrats put themselves in charge of the “clean up.” In 2012 they founded the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a left wing voter registration drive disguised as voter roll “accuracy” management. Funded by a grant from the Soros Open Society, ERIC is now controls the voter logs in 31 States, plus D.C.\n\nThe database tracks everything a bad actor would need to influence the outcome of an election. For example TGP explains:\n\n“Member states must not only submit all details on inactive and active voters to ERIC every 60 days. But they must also provide every individual in their states Motor Vehicle Department database, both licensed and ID recipients. This combo of data is breathtaking. It’s everyone who could generate a legal ballot… This data includes names, addresses, DOB, License #, last 4 of social security #, voter activity, phone, email, type of citizenship documentation, and much more!” (See Exhibit A, B)\n\nIn addition ERIC accumulates direct voting data for federal elections. The database records: “the total number of provisional ballots cast; the total number of provisional ballots counted; the total number of provisional ballots uncounted, by reason (if available); the number of new voters who registered and voted on the same day; and the number of updates to a voter’s existing registration submitted on the same day on which they voted.” (See Exhibit A, C)\n\nJust about the only thing that ERIC does NOT want to know is who is voting illegally. Their rules explain that “under no circumstances shall the members transmit any record indicating an individual is a non-citizen of the U.S.” (See Exhibit A, 2b)\n\nIn 2020, ERIC managed to add 17 million new voters to the rolls in time for the November election, three times the 5.7 million they found for Obama’s 2012 re-election when they only had 7 member states. \n\nHanding over the management of our voter rolls and all of our election data to Soros & comrades is a recipe for perennial election sabotage. Ask your state representatives what they’re doing about ERIC. These are the 31 states currently ensnared in the Soros system:\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Washington D.C., West Virginia, Wisconsin\n\nRead 📰 TGP Part 1, DJHJ Media, ERIC Bylaws\nRelated🔎 PILF ERIC-Related DC Lawsuit, Anatomy of the Steal - Phase 1: Dirty Voter Rolls\n\n@LibertyOverwatchChannel\n—",

Le polémiste divise son action en trois axes : \"imposer la discrétion\", \"stopper l'endoctrinement\" et \"empêcher l'influence étrangère\". Le candidat souhaite avec ces mesures \"reconquérir la France\" et selon lui cela passe par l'interdiction du port du voile dans l'espace public, l'interdiction de construire des édifices religieux imposants, fermer définitivement les lieux de promotion du djihad ou encore imposer le contrôle strict des imams et des financements du culte musulman. Eric Zemmour présente son projet au lendemain de la diffusion de l'enquête de Zone Interdite intitulé : \"Face au danger de l’Islam radical, les réponses de l’État\".",

It essentially posits that, due to a lack of social connection and the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the public is able to be hypnotised en-masse. In this case, a dictatorial higher power has caused them to blindly buy into a false narrative: getting vaccinated will end the pandemic. Proponents of the theory claim variety of nefarious motives, ranging from subtle erosion of freedom to outright genocide via unsafe vaccines.\"\n\nhttps://guitar.com/news/music-news/eric-clapton-youtube-using-subliminal-advertising-keep-masses-subservient-interview-posted-youtube/",

          "message": "‼️Eric Clapton: Menschen, die den Covid-Impfstoff erhalten haben, sind Opfer einer Massenhypnose\n\n   \" Im Jahr 2020 veröffentlichte der weltberühmte Sänger Eric Clapton zusammen mit Van Morrison (76) den Song Stand And Deliver, in dem er sich gegen Covid-Verbote wandte.  Zuvor hatte er veröffentlicht, unter den Nebenwirkungen des AstraZeneca-Präparats gelitten zu haben, die dazu führten, dass seine Hände und Füße entweder \"erfroren, taub oder brennend\" waren.\n\nIn einem neuen Interview für den YouTube-Kanal The Real Music Observer sagte Eric, dass unterschwellige Botschaften, die in der Werbung versteckt waren, die Menschen dazu brachten, sich impfen zu lassen. Er sagte: \"Was auch immer das Memo war, es hatte mich nicht erreicht. Dann begann ich zu begreifen, dass es wirklich ein Memo gab, und ein Typ, Mattias Desmet [Professor für klinische Psychologie an der Universität Gent in Belgien], sprach darüber.\n\nDie Theorie der Massenbildungshypnose. Und dann konnte ich es sehen. Sobald ich anfing, danach zu suchen, sah ich sie überall. Dann erinnerte ich mich daran, kleine Dinge auf YouTube gesehen zu haben, die wie unterschwellige Werbung waren. Das lief schon lange: diese Sache mit \"du wirst nichts besitzen und du wirst glücklich sein\". \n\nUnd ich dachte: \"Was soll das bedeuten?\" Und nach und nach setzte ich eine Art grobes Puzzle zusammen. Und das hat mich noch entschlossener gemacht. (...) Auf die Frage, warum er sich dazu gedrängt fühlte, sich zu äußern, erklärte Clapton: \"Meine Karriere war sowieso schon fast vorbei. Zu dem Zeitpunkt, als ich mich zu Wort meldete, war es fast 18 Monate her, dass ich zwangsweise in den Ruhestand versetzt worden war. \n\nUnd während ich mit anderen Musikern darüber sprach, mich aufregte, stellte ich fest, dass niemand das hören wollte. Ich war verblüfft, ich schien die einzige Person zu sein, die sich darüber erregte.\n\nMeine Familie und meine Freunde bekamen Angst, und ich glaube, sie waren meinetwegen verängstigt. Clapton fügte hinzu, dass er auch aufgehört habe, die Nachrichten zu sehen, weil es dort nur um das Befolgen von Befehlen und Gehorsam gehe.\n\nNachdem er seine Ansichten geäußert hatte, sagte der \"Wonderful Tonight\"-Hitmacher, der Vater der Töchter Ruth (37), Julie (20), Ella (19) und der 16-jährigen Sophie ist: \"Meine Familie und meine Freunde halten mich sowieso für einen Spinner.\n\nIm letzten Jahr ist viel verschwunden, viel Staub aufgewirbelt worden, und die Leute sind ziemlich schnell weggezogen. Das hat für mich die Art von Freundschaft, die ich habe, verfeinert. Sie haben sich auf die Menschen reduziert, die ich offensichtlich wirklich brauche und liebe.\n\nInnerhalb meiner Familie wurde das ziemlich entscheidend... Ich habe Mädchen im Teenageralter und ein älteres Mädchen, das in den Dreißigern ist - und sie alle mussten mir etwas Spielraum lassen, weil ich nicht in der Lage war, irgendwen von ihnen zu überzeugen. Clapton, der mit Melia McEnery verheiratet ist, fügte hinzu: \"Ich würde versuchen, Musikerkollegen zu erreichen, aber manchmal höre ich einfach nichts von ihnen.\n\nMein Telefon klingelt nicht sehr oft. Ich erhalte nicht mehr so viele SMS und E-Mails. \n\nClapton veröffentlicht seit Monaten Statements und Songs gegen Impfungen und das Einsperren von Kindern. Im Dezember 2020 sang Clapton zusammen mit seinem Kollegen, dem Classic Rocker und Anti-Vaxxer Van, den Song Stand and Deliver.\"\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10435175/Eric-Clapton-claims-people-Covid-vaccine-victims-mass-formation-hypnosis.html",

Zuvor hatte er veröffentlicht, unter den Nebenwirkungen des AstraZeneca-Präparats gelitten zu haben, die dazu führten, dass seine Hände und Füße entweder \"erfroren, taub oder brennend\" waren.\n\nIn einem neuen Interview für den YouTube-Kanal The Real Music Observer sagte Eric, dass unterschwellige Botschaften, die in der Werbung versteckt waren, die Menschen dazu brachten, sich impfen zu lassen. Er sagte: \"Was auch immer das Memo war, es hatte mich nicht erreicht. Dann begann ich zu begreifen, dass es wirklich ein Memo gab, und ein Typ, Mattias Desmet [Professor für klinische Psychologie an der Universität Gent in Belgien], sprach darüber.\n\nDie Theorie der Massenbildungshypnose. Und dann konnte ich es sehen. Sobald ich anfing, danach zu suchen, sah ich sie überall. Dann erinnerte ich mich daran, kleine Dinge auf YouTube gesehen zu haben, die wie unterschwellige Werbung waren. Das lief schon lange: diese Sache mit \"du wirst nichts besitzen und du wirst glücklich sein\". \n\nUnd ich dachte: \"Was soll das bedeuten?\" Und nach und nach setzte ich eine Art grobes Puzzle zusammen. Und das hat mich noch entschlossener gemacht. (...) Auf die Frage, warum er sich dazu gedrängt fühlte, sich zu äußern, erklärte Clapton: \"Meine Karriere war sowieso schon fast vorbei. Zu dem Zeitpunkt, als ich mich zu Wort meldete, war es fast 18 Monate her, dass ich zwangsweise in den Ruhestand versetzt worden war. \n\nUnd während ich mit anderen Musikern darüber sprach, mich aufregte, stellte ich fest, dass niemand das hören wollte. Ich war verblüfft, ich schien die einzige Person zu sein, die sich darüber erregte.\n\nMeine Familie und meine Freunde bekamen Angst, und ich glaube, sie waren meinetwegen verängstigt. Clapton fügte hinzu, dass er auch aufgehört habe, die Nachrichten zu sehen, weil es dort nur um das Befolgen von Befehlen und Gehorsam gehe.\n\nNachdem er seine Ansichten geäußert hatte, sagte der \"Wonderful Tonight\"-Hitmacher, der Vater der Töchter Ruth (37), Julie (20), Ella (19) und der 16-jährigen Sophie ist: \"Meine Familie und meine Freunde halten mich sowieso für einen Spinner.\n\nIm letzten Jahr ist viel verschwunden, viel Staub aufgewirbelt worden, und die Leute sind ziemlich schnell weggezogen. Das hat für mich die Art von Freundschaft, die ich habe, verfeinert. Sie haben sich auf die Menschen reduziert, die ich offensichtlich wirklich brauche und liebe.\n\nInnerhalb meiner Familie wurde das ziemlich entscheidend... Ich habe Mädchen im Teenageralter und ein älteres Mädchen, das in den Dreißigern ist - und sie alle mussten mir etwas Spielraum lassen, weil ich nicht in der Lage war, irgendwen von ihnen zu überzeugen. Clapton, der mit Melia McEnery verheiratet ist, fügte hinzu: \"Ich würde versuchen, Musikerkollegen zu erreichen, aber manchmal höre ich einfach nichts von ihnen.\n\nMein Telefon klingelt nicht sehr oft. Ich erhalte nicht mehr so viele SMS und E-Mails. \n\nClapton veröffentlicht seit Monaten Statements und Songs gegen Impfungen und das Einsperren von Kindern. Im Dezember 2020 sang Clapton zusammen mit seinem Kollegen, dem Classic Rocker und Anti-Vaxxer Van, den Song Stand and Deliver.\"\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10435175/Eric-Clapton-claims-people-Covid-vaccine-victims-mass-formation-hypnosis.html",

Америка занимается тем, что настраивает страны Европы против России, поскольку большая», — объяснил он. По мнению Земмура, при малейшем сближении Европы с Россией Вашингтон пытается их разделить. \n\n«Франция могла бы показать дружественные сигналы по отношению к Москве, например, отменив санкции. Если бы я был президентом, я бы сказал, что больше не будет санкций против России», — заявил он.\n\nПрезидент Франции Эммануэль Макрон является лидером опросов общественного мнения и остается главным фаворитом на предстоящих президентских выборах, которые пройдут в апреле 2022 года. Почти каждый второй француз (48 процентов) назвал политика победителем гонки. Лишь шесть процентов верят в победу кандидата от движения «Отвоевание» Эрика Земмура.",

Vos and certain members of our WI GOP Legislature have gone FULL TRAITOR on their own citizens.\n\nLATE BREAKING NEWS: The new bill being presented this week to the legislature is essentially the WI/state version of “HR1/For The People”\n\nAnd wait for it, it’s being presented by REPUBLICANS.  Sen. Kathy Bernier through her Senate Committee (Elections, Elections Process Reform & Ethics).\n\nIt’s not just the legalizing of dropboxes. Tucked away are changing SVD laws for “infectious diseases” & “public health emergencies”, allowing nursing home employees to become “personal care voting assistants.” And most dangerous giving the national voter registration database ERIC the FULL autonomy over the voter roles in WI. \n\nThey are trying to legalize the stolen election practices of 2020. And after claiming over and over they didn’t break the law. Then why change the laws?\n\nWe can’t let this happen!\n\nhttps://exposure.locals.com/upost/1588737/late-breaking-news-wi-senate-bill-is-hr1-for-the-people-wi-version",

Er sagt:\n\n✔️ Wir müssen ein Freund Russlands sein. Wir müssen aufhören, ein Instrument der USA zu sein. Die USA versuchen, Russland und Frankreich von Deutschland zu trennen, und jedes Mal, wenn es zu einer Annäherung kommt, finden die Amerikaner Wege, sie zu trennen.\n\n✔️ Ich glaube nicht, dass Russland sich in die Wahlen einmischt. Es sind eher die Amerikaner, die ihre Verbündeten abgehört haben, als die Russischen.\n\n✔️ Russland verfolgt seine eigene Politik, die natürlich darauf abzielt, seinen Einfluss zu verbreiten. Ich denke, Frankreich könnte freundliche Signale gegenüber Russland zeigen, zum Beispiel durch die Aufhebung der Sanktionen.\n\n✔️ Wenn ich Präsident wäre, würde ich sagen, dass es keine Sanktionen mehr gegen Russland geben wird.\n\n✔️ Die Franzosen und Russen sind zwei große Nationen, die sich mehr ähneln, als wir denken. Russische Leute, russische Kultur, russische Literatur, Dostojewski, Tolstoi, Grossman, ich bin ein Fan der russischen Literatur.‌‌\n\nJetzt fehlt nur noch ein Staatsmann in Deutschland, damit die Achse Paris, Berlin, Moskau wieder wirken kann. 💪\n\nBitte teilt unsere Beiträge in anderen Gruppen und auf Kanälen weiter, damit mehr Menschen die Wahrheit über Wladimir Putin erfahren. Um von Putin zu lernen, damit wir eines Tages so einen wie Putin auch in Deutschland an der Macht haben. 😎\n\nABONNIERE @Putin_Fanclub und erfahre bei uns die Wahrheit über Russland und Wladimir Putin.\n\n#Frankreich #Russland #Deutschland #Politik",

The intent of the court order was to “induce compliance with the subpoenas at issue, not to seek the incarceration of two elected officials,” the Cap Times reported. \n\nOn Friday, Judge Ramirez said he needed more facts before deciding whether to compel the mayors to testify, asking both sides to submit their arguments over the next 10 weeks and set a hearing for April 22, according to an AP News article. \n\n“The investigation was supposed to be done in December, but the legal battles will prolong it past the end of the legislative session in March when Republicans hoped to act on recommendations,” the article continued. \n\n“The latest twists come in a multi-faceted legal battle over the Republican-ordered investigation that involves multiple lawsuits in different counties before several judges. Most, if not all, of the cases are expected to make their way to the conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court,” AP News concluded. \n\nEarlier this month, Dane County Circuit Judge Rhonda Lanford rejected AG Kaul’s attempt to block Gableman’s Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) subpoena. Lanford’s ruling allows Gableman to move forward with his deposition of the state’s chief elections administrator, Meagan Wolfe, and obtain election-related documents and data.  \n\nRead 📰 Milwaukee Sentinel, Cap Times, AP News\nLearn more🔦🧵 WI Thread\n\n@LibertyOverwatchChannel\n—",
