One FBI agent was wounded during the ambush. The FBI and the Oakland County Medical Examiner’s Office attempted to keep details about the case hidden from the public, but the Detroit News obtained the autopsy report following an appeal.\nThis all occurred on Oct. 2, 2020 — just days before the fake Whitmer kidnapping was rolled out in an October surprise meant to influence the presidential election. Allport was riddled with bullet holes by the FBI as they supposedly attempted to apprehend him on illegal gun charges.\n“It almost mirrors Ruby Ridge, what they did to Eric,” Allport’s mother, Judy Grider, said to the Detroit News. As a child, Allport’s family were neighbors with Randy Weaver, the patriotic martyr whose family was gruesomely murdered by federal agents who ensnared him in an entrapment plot during a lengthy standoff in Idaho\n\n\nhttps://bigleaguepolitics.com/autopsy-shows-fbi-agents-executed-domestic-terrorist-in-michigan-days-before-fake-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-was-rolled-out/\n\n~Schillinger",
