There are very good people there, that are truly trying to reach the youth, but don't get play because it doesn't fit their plan, which is opposite of their members and community become wise, educated, and make their own decisions.  Overwhelmingly, people I met there are very very smart, but they are trapped in the lies of those that seem to be \"wise\" because they are put out in front.  But what I was invited to do with the men from that church had no business being in any church with Christ in its name.  I was utterly disgusted by what I heard with them.  It was not a problem in their eyes.  I do know Marcus Rodgers calls out many people in front, but I don't know if he or any of his parishioners have spent time with that church.  But after reverend Wright's statements were issued after Obama's election victory, they are very cautious and keep a lower profile.  Not everything they said with my time with them do I object to.  What I did get vocal on was hearing Eric Michael Dyson basically call black children stupid.  That they needed to lower the education standards because black children can't keep up with whites or asians.  I had just spoken with the youth present... they easily were as smart as any white child that I knew.  So you can see why people in that church are stuck in the lie.  Needless to say, the person sitting next to me had to go to a safe place and they made an announcement regarding the incident.  All I did was say Eric was a joke.  I'll stand on those words today.  Eric, you are a joke, but I'll also add... you are a punk for misleading your people.",

          "message": "A Dallas journalist said she was fired last month after referring to the city’s mayor as ‘bruh’ in a tweet. The since-deleted tweet was in reference to Mayor Eric Johnson’s claim that local media was not covering the decline in violent crimes in Dallas.\n\n‘Bruh, national news is always going to chase the trend. Cultivate relationships with quality local news partnerships,’ Meghan Mangrum, who was an education reporter for the Dallas Morning News, tweeted. According to HuffPost, multiple local news outlets, including the Dallas Morning News itself, had been covering the trend, despite the mayor’s claims otherwise.\n\nHowever, Mangrum’s use of ‘bruh’ faced criticism from the mayor and his chief of staff. ’Gotta love when folks let their inherent biases show. I get to be addressed as ‘bruh’ by someone who writes for my daily local paper whom I’ve never met,’ Johnson, who is Black, tweeted.\n\nIn an interview with D Magazine, Mangrum said she received an email from her editor later that day asking her to attend a meeting. During the ensuing conversation, Mangrum, who is white, said she was asked by the executive editor, who is Black, if she would have used the word ‘bruh’ if Johnson was white. Mangrum said she replied in the affirmative, saying it was in her ‘vernacular’ as a millennial from Central Florida, and cited other times she used the word on Twitter.\n\nShe was consequently fired for violating the company’s social media policy. But she said Dallas Morning News management did not specify which part of the policy she defied.\n\n‘Standing up for my colleagues and the work that we do, when I know we’re doing good and honest work, is something I pride myself on and something that I look for in my colleagues and in my workplace as well,’ she told D Magazine.",
