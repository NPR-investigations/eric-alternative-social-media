          "message": "Walking Wide Awake into World War III\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine, along with rising tensions between NATO and Russia, have drawn comparisons to the outbreak of World War I.\n\nIn 2014, back when the open hostilities in Ukraine really began, the journalist Eric Margolis said ‚ÄúWe can stumble into a war with Russia. This reminds me of 1914 all over again.‚Äù\n\nThis ‚Äústumbling‚Äù of course refers to the ‚Äúsleepwalking thesis of war‚Äù that is part of both popular and scholarly narratives of World War I.\n\nThe International Relations realist Stephen Walt warned ‚Äúthe West is sleepwalking into war in Ukraine‚Äù the day before Russia invaded. The World Health Organization (yes, that one) has warned the world could be sleepwalking into a nuclear war. And the Asia-Pacific Leadership Network is concerned the world might be ‚Äúsleepwalking into nuclear Armageddon.‚Äù\n\nUnfortunately, it‚Äôs much worse than that. The United States is marching wide awake toward general nuclear war.\n\nPrinceton University historian Stephen Kotkin has criticized the sleepwalking thesis of war as a comforting myth that remains ‚Äúclose to people‚Äôs hearts‚Äù to this day.\n\n‚ÄúNobody ever sleepwalks into war,‚Äù he says.\n\nKotkin points out that the government and military archives of the Great Powers contain thousands of orders to move horses, hay, and weapons systems into place to prosecute the war years before Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated. The Great Powers also imposed military conscription to ensure they would have a wealth of young men to feed into the slaughter.\n\nKotkin says:\n\nYou go into the archives, and you see nothing but decisions being made towards war. And somehow this is known as sleepwalking towards war. There was no sleepwalking to World War I. There was only preparation for war. There was nothing but incessant preparation to war.\n\nLibertarian Institute Director Scott Horton agrees; ‚ÄúYou call it sleepwalking but everybody‚Äôs wide awake. It‚Äôs just, they‚Äôre stupid.‚Äù\n\nThe stupidity continues. This time it isn‚Äôt horses and Maxim machine guns being ordered into Europe, it‚Äôs ‚Äúhighly accurate guided tactical nuclear weapons.‚Äù That‚Äôs right, the United States is sending B61-12 tactical, air-dropped gravity bombs to NATO bases. According to Bryan Bender, Paul McLeary, and Erin Banco in Politico, the nuclear arsenal upgrade was originally planned for Spring 2023, but is being accelerated. The new bombs should arrive in time for Christmas.\n\nSource: Libertarian Institute\n\nJoin us on Minds!\n\nFollow:üëá\n@G3News",
