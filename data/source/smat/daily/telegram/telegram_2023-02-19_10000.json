So sprach kürzlich Pink-Floyd-Sänger Roger Waters vor dem UN-Sicherheitsrat und verurteilte die Ukraine-Politik des Westens aufs Schärfste.\n\nAn die fünf ständigen Ratsmitglieder gerichtet fragte er: “Was sind Ihre Ziele? Höhere Gewinne für die Kriegsindustrien? Mehr Macht in der Welt? Ein größerer Anteil am globalen Kuchen?”\n\nEbenfalls gegen den Strom schwimmt Rock-Musiker Eric Clapton. Zunächst sprach er öffentlich über schwere Covid-Impf-Nebenwirkungen. Seitdem veröffentlicht er unbequeme Songs und Interviews. \n\nDoch auch immer mehr Top-Politiker und Manager ziehen persönliche Konsequenzen. So gibt Weltbank-Chef David Malpass gerade sein Amt vorzeitig auf wegen kritischer Äußerungen zur Erderwärmung.\n\nEva-Herman.net | Odysee\n\nZum Online-Kongress: \nhttps://www.stabildurchdenwandel.net",

Beckstrand identified specific instances in Georgia and North Carolina and testified that a Dominion machine was “hacked” in Michigan.  Beckstrand confirmed that these security failures were “reported about in the news.”\n\nAnd just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Dominion’s Director of Product Strategy and Security, Eric Coomer, acknowledged in private that “our shit is just riddled with bugs.”  Indeed, Coomer had been castigating Dominion’s failures for years. In 2019, Coomer noted that “our products suck.”  He lamented that “[a]lmost all” of Dominion’s technological failings were “due to our complete f— up in installation.”\n☝️🤷‍♂",

They slandered me, they punished my family, attacked my friends, forced me to resign from my company, threatened my wife and children, caused me to fortify my house and live with a weapon in my hand while I slept. And then this happened... they were forced to admit their system was shit, and they knew it was vulnerable, buggy, hackable and in Eric Coomer's own words \"complete shit\". In private they knew, in public they said \"safest most secure election in US history\" while they stole the voice of the American people... I was truthful and right 2+ years ago and now the truth is coming to light. God always wins. I don't know how I feel about this actually. I'm angry, yet feel vindicated yet again.

Mike Lindell and alllll of them are getting sued. \n\nWho sent Josh in to cover for dominion? JOE OLTMANN PERHAPS? \n\nRemember what happened RIGHT after? Clements supposedly lost his job and JOE OLTMANN started a GIVE SEND GO for Clements and himself of 500k EACH! \n\nThey used the SIMPosium to raise a ton of money off of y’all. \n\nLindell took Clements to TRUMP. \n\nZIGZAG was also acting like a big shot with Eric Coomer. Remember Joe O was the one that supposedly whistle blew on Joe Oltmann? Remeber the messages I just posted a few days ago about Josh not calling out Joe Oltmann for entertaining the idea of Josh and me and having an affair..Josh told me I didn’t understand? \n\nYeah Josh manufactures that rumor for them all to spread and SLANDER me. Knowing it was BS. Josh is from ILLINOIS and so is his “wife”. \n\nJosh is working with ZIGZAG…\n\nFunny I was just talking about Zig being a  Christian and Josh believes in Odin.\n\nJosh was in on the ENTIRE SIMPosium debacle and was working with the DEMS and Assholes to rip my group away. \n\nJosh tried to disappear on me and got covid. He knew Carter was about to leave. He knew because of what Carter orchestrated. \n\nSo Josh was going to not only make me lose Carter, but also him. The two people I trusted the most. \n\nThat’s why Carter kept asking Josh about covid and Carter told me he was in a worse place than Josh medically and then he “died”. Then he WATCHED Josh screw me over. Josh told me he talked to Carter to try and hurt me. KELLYE brought me in too. They were all trying to turn me against Carter so they could handle me. The one person that had my best interest they wanted me to turn against. If I released him, they could handle me. Luckily others came in to help. \n\nGOD HAD OTHER PLANS…\n\nCoomer and Oltmann and Zig are working together. \n\nEVERYONE ON THIS APP that brought us here IS WORKING WITH OBAMA.",

          "message": "VIP Elite Panic After REAL Epstein List Leaked on Dark Web\n\nThe life and supposed death of Jeffrey Epstein has been one of great controversy, and for good reason – the implications of the allegations are huge. They threaten to shatter our illusions of powerful people including Presidents, high ranking politicians and those trusted to run our companies and countries. These people would be, under the definitions of our systems, criminals committing heinous and unforgivable crimes against humanity.\n\nFor anyone who hasn’t been paying attention, the elite are heavily into pedophilia and satanism. They all have the dirt on each other and will do anything to protect those within their ranks.\n\nBut if you are following the mainstream news coverage of court cases and expecting them to release real information about Epstein’s VIP elite clients, you are wasting your time. The mainstream media will never release this information. It would end their world as they know it. The entire corrupt system would be destroyed from the inside.\n\nBut the information will come out. We just have to keep looking in the right places. And when the information comes out, we cannot forgive and forget.\n\nWhat do we know so far? We know that Jeffrey Epstein was close friend of former president Bill Clinton and best friend of Queen Elizabeth’s favorite son, Prince Andrew. These two reprobates were so desperate to spend as much time as possible with Epstein that they left a trail of evidence that fact checkers, who are experts in making scandals go away for the elite, haven’t been able to cover up the evidence.\n\nHunter Biden, son of Creepy Joe Biden, is another reprobate who has left a trail of evidence about his predilections, mostly involving crack cocaine, prostitution and incest. But the media is engaged in a huge cover up when it comes to the extent of the darkness on Hunter’s laptop from hell.\n\nAfter Hunter Biden’s laptop emails were leaked before the last election, internet sleuths discovered evidence of yet more pizza-related pedophile “code words” being used in emails which reference both Hillary Clinton and John Podesta.\n\nIn 2016, NewsPunch.com exclusively broke the story of how pedophile code words were used in email exchanges, leaked by Wikileaks, between Hillary Clinton and her campaign chair John Podesta.\n\nNow it seems Hunter Biden was also involved in the scandal. In an email (archived here) dated 30th March, 2016, Hunter’s business partner Eric Scherwin sent him an invite to a pizza party involving Tony Podesta, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and James Alefantis of Comet Ping Pong.\n\nThe email had the subject line “Putala for Hillary”. Interestingly Putala means “an effigy of sin.”\n\nmoar\n\nhttps://newspunch.com/vip-elite-panic-after-real-epstein-list-leaked-on-dark-web/\n\nvideo 10:26\n\nhttps://rumble.com/v29z90o-vip-elite-panic-after-real-epstein-list-leaked-on-dark-web.html",
