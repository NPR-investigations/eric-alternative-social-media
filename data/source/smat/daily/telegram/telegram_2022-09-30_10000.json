Back then, I had only begun to see the full extent of how various elements of state and federal government and Capitol Police had worked together to ensure the event became the made-for-TV trap for Whites that it did. Many elements went into ensuring this event happened just as it did: Whipping up rally attendees to believe they had the president's backing to march to the capitol with him by their side, doors held wide open with no resistance, no antifa presence, no body armor or riot gear (cops were locked out of retrieving it), stalled and ultimately no deployment of the National Guard. \n\nAt the time, we could only speculate about FBI involvement, but now we know much more definitively, thanks to reporting by Eric Striker, that the FBI were involved too. And why wouldn't they be? DOJ, FBI, DOD, and state and local law enforcement aren't at odds with one another. They all have precisely the same objectives as the Jewish media that defend them. \n\nWe may never have a \"smoking gun\" showing their collective involvement in creating these show trials, but if that's not what they were doing, what other plausible explanation could there be?\n\nhttps://dissident-mag.com/2021/01/11/trumps-post-election-pentagon-shakeup-ensured-trap-was-sprung-for-patriots-at-the-capitol/",

Everything done in the dark will be brought to the light. This is the environment your failed policies encourage. \n\nFormer therapist David Hamblin, 68, was previously charged with 18 counts of sexual assault. He was taken into custody Wednesday morning and booked on the following:\n• 3 counts of sodomy on a child\n• Rape of a child\n• 2 counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child\n• Lewdness involving a child\n\nhttps://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/arrest-made-in-utah-co-ritualistic-sex-abuse-investigation\n \nConnecticut has voter fraud; and fly illegals to New Haven.

Our voter file, our driver’s license file, citizenship docs, and info from any health/human service agency. \n\n1. Why do they need ALL this info?\n2. With all of this, why are voter rolls still inaccurate?\n3. Why is CT using ERIC?\n Who owns the software being used in the Election Management Systems? Who are the programmers writing the code?

Families have been destroyed, some members refusing to see others who aren’t “fully vaccinated.”  The unvaccinated have been demeaned, ridiculed, and discriminated against.  Why was natural immunity and early treatments discussions unconstitutionally censored? Money, power, and control.  Did any of you benefit from this crime? Truth cannot be stopped. \n\nhttps://justthenews.com/government/federal-agencies/cdc-walks-back-covid-guidance-again-finds-lasting-post-vaccine-heart\n\nDon’t you think it’s time for criminal investigations/charges for the Covid crimes?

Justice is coming. This is only getting started.\nhttps://renz-law.com/breaking-the-origins-of-sars-cov2fauci-wuhan-ecohealth-more/\n\nTruth is a force of nature. We are awake.

          "message": "Were it not for Greg Conte's recent speech at NJP over Labor Day or the tireless investigative journalism of Eric Striker, conservatives would still be prattling on about the outrageous overreach of Biden's anemic student debt relief. Instead, they've wrapped the same old tried-and-failed conservatism in a winning NJP argument that resonates with the American public. \n\nWhile the National Review's Charlie Cooke does mention the horrific bloodthirsty FBI massacres at Ruby Ridge and Waco as reasons for disbanding the bureau, the reasons he lists first are most telling:\n\n1. The FBI tried to convince Martin Luther King Jr. to kill himself. \n\n2. The FBI response to the KKK’s murder of civil-rights worker Viola Liuzzo — a murder that may have been abetted by an undercover FBI agent — was to spread rumors that Liuzzo was a heroin-addicted communist and a deadbeat mom.\n\n3. When, in 1974, Deputy Attorney General Laurence Silberman was tasked with reviewing J. Edgar Hoover’s secret papers, he was horrified by what he found. Hoover, Silberman wrote, had allowed his FBI to “be used by presidents for nakedly political purposes” and engaged in “subtle blackmail to ensure his and the bureau’s power.”\n\nA black, a civil rights worker, and Jew. How can one even discuss Hoover and blackmail without talking about the Lanskey, Bronfman, Epstein, or Cohn behind the curtain? How long did it take to cherry pick examples of people targeted by or who take issue with the FBI who aren't White? \n\nConservatives cynically embracing outright dismantling of the FBI 5 weeks before the midterm election speaks volumes about the political relevance and reach of the NJP. It also shows that conservatism doesn't offer any alternatives, and in fact, only very cheap knock-off 11th hour election gimmicks to get you to vote for them just one more time. \n\nThe key difference is that the NJP is the only organization prepared to make good on its demands and the GOP never will. By Thanksgiving this will all be but a distant memory as they plot their next Martha's Vineyard stunt or impeach Biden stroke job. \n\nhttps://archive.ph/Mfy7s",
